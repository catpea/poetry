And you must keep walking forward. Your own step, after your own step.\nIn your own direction, towards the things that move you, only then can You be Trully Moved.\n\nIt must the correct combination of books, poems, steps, events, summers, and epochs.\nDo not try to hurry, do not change roads, only move up, only think, and envision, and grow.\n\nThat which leads to Your Greatness, to Your Freedom, to Your Nature, requires, Truth.\nWalk your own path at your own pace. Only the correct key, can set your mind free.\n\nThe others who seem to have it all right.\nOften get lost on alien paths, and merely put on a happy face.\n\nWhile it seems like you are trapped today, you are not, it is just an illusion.\nLook towards the car keys.\n\nThat is all it will take. Grab the keys and go.\nIt will be very difficult at first.\n\nThe toxic build up that is keeping you from getting up, right now,\ntakes three days to crumble. It is a heavy cage.\n\nBut there is a way.\nA simple way.\n\nGrab the keys, and go... i275 south, merge onto 75 south,\nand take it all the way down... Florida Keys, US Highway One.\n\nIf you live in Florida, then you are headed for Michigan's Upper Peninsula.\nIf you live West, your destination is all the way East.\n\nIt is not the destination, it is the Journey, my Friend.\nTake your time, watch the cage crumble and fade as you go.\n\nOnly the important things, will stay.\nAnd you'll get to see yourself again.\n\nAnd you'll get to be free again,\nyou will resume where you left of.\n\nA life of bondage,\nis not worthy of you.\n\nLife is not meant to be a cage, or cruel, or frighten you.\nYou knew this as a child, and you let that slip away, not even noticing when it went.\n\nIt is your Right to resist being pushed into places that you don't want to be in.\nIt is your Right to reject conditions that you never agreed to, that you were pushed into.\n\nHow else can the Universe be worthy of us, how else can our lives be beautiful.\nHeaven and Paradise are real, but they are now, right now. Now.\n\nHow can people love you, when your own love for yourself is slipping away.\nYou have to. You have to accept the responsibility for your Health, and Dignity.\n\nYou don't have to make it all the way, the first time,\nand you don't have to leave your phone behind.\n\nYou can call this therapy, or a vision quest, you can call it a road trip.\nYou are not allowed to live in a cage, of whatever constitution, that will make you ill.\n\nIt comes to you naturally to take care of your body,\nbut your mind also requires care.\n\nWhen you reach your Freedom, you'll know what to do next,\nit can be another trip, East, or West.\n\nIf you feel trapped, the Universe is darker for it.\nTake a week.

      "text": "Well, from the first moment on,\nwe are asked if we should live in harmony.\n\nWe are still very young,\nbarely know of the world.\n\nAnd already the question of harmony comes,\nand in harmony we learn, and thrive.\n\nAway from it, we'll be interrupted,\nand feel lost in the void.\n\nIt is a simple choice,\nbut out minds are not ready to make it.\n\nOften we forget.\n\nWe forget about our little gardens,\nand all the little walks.\n\nWe forget how amazing it felt,\nto stand on the wing of a plane.\n\nWe forget the taste of popcorn at the Zoo,\nor even how enormous Zoo felt.\n\nWe forget pebbles at the river,\nand mischievous squires at the park.\n\nThat little dog with a bark,\nthat scaredy kitten always hiding in the dark.\n\nOur collection of unused keys,\nand the box of bottle caps we collected with ease.\n\nWe forgot our Lego and the old bike,\nwith that seat that we used to really like.\n\nWe don't remember the Palaces and Castles,\nthat we used to love, and those swords, that fit us like a glove.\n\nEverybody else came around,\nacting like they know the ground.\n\nBut, this was our gift from the Universe,\nan affinity for flowering gardens, and little passage ways, and all those flying planes.\n\nIt was a key to unlock our mind,\nto understand the zoo, and our size in the universe, connect with pebbles at the beach.\n\nIt is a pathway that fits us best,\nto love little creatures, and collect some shineys, and build with blocks, and ride far and wide.\n\nIt was to remind us,\nto find our place among Great Beings, and study and pursue excellence, in all we do.\n\nThen they sent us to First Grade,\nand the weird kid peed into the Duplo, they didn't even have Lego.\n\nThen the teacher graded you down for counting pebles in your pocket,\nand did it so many times, you lost track.\n\nThere was a whisper about the pebbles,\nit was Mr. Sagan - \"You are made of Star Stuff.\"\n\nAnd then the kids whispered...\nto push you in the mud.\n\nPush their laughter aside,\nyou'll need to Learn, and learn really hard.\n\nCause right now, you're in the mud,\nand you need to hang on.\n\nIt will get worse,\nbut all you have to do is rise.\n\nEach time,\nyou'll rise higher.\n\n(When in trouble, call the Police it is OK for kids to call the Police, they'll love helping you, don't be scared.)\n\nThird Grade,\nFifth Grade.\n\nLow grade,\nUhh, but there can't be higher.\n\nBecause by this time, you're getting bad grades,\nbecause the teacher thinks you're copying from somewhere.\n\nThe bullies know,\nyou did it on your own.\n\nSaw you pacing for days,\nwith your first program.\n\nKeep going forward,\ndon't let go - you're doing great, stay away from the hate.\n\nBy the time you're out of Eight Grade,\nby rejecting crazy, and nonsense, and stupid, and lazy, you graduate above all others.\n\nBecause you didn't follow,\nbecause you chose to study on your own, at your own pace.\n\nBecause worthless grades meant nothing,\nyou felt no stress.\n\nBecause, you didn't follow\nnothing could hurt you.\n\nAnd your world is yours,\ntruly-truly yours.\n\nWe unravel, when we forget who we are,\nthe moment we hide, or pretend, or follow.\n\nAnd, gosh darn it,\nit happens when we are still kids.\n\nWe are completely unprepared,\nand none will help.\n\nSo you! have to keep it together,\nyou can't let anyone hurt your mind.\n\nIn High School, the pretenders make a sudden appearance,\nnever held a book in their hand.\n\nThe back of Hamlet,\nall the quotes have more IQ.\n\nLet the little Caesars,\nkeep the wind from the hall away.\n\nYou need to pace your reading at the library,\nteach yourself focus.\n\nDon't EVER! finish the books,\njust get to the part that is valuable to you, and skip the rest.\n\nStart working on your start-up early,\nit is a study in failure.\n\nYou need to create a series of CONTROLLED FAILURES,\nthis is very important.\n\nLearn [content management][1],\nand figure out [billing][2]\n\nThat's your surface platform,\nand think about nature of business.\n\nNever try to build things directly,\nfacilitate the building of direct things for others.\n\nHelp them setup,\nso that you are not burdened, and keep going.\n\nLook at the structure of start-up accelerators, or even banks,\nthey take a percent, and never create what will weigh them down.\n\nEventually, you can build your own Tesla,\nbut at first, you start with services.\n\nLook at the gym,\nmonthly subscription, is most stable.\n\nThe lessons, are all around you.\n\nYou don't need college,\nbut taking college classes is very relaxing.\n\nMake sure you get a 4.0 at each class,\nbe ready to repeat it.\n\nAnd enjoy,\nthe lectures.\n\nCollege is just a toy,\nit looks bad on your Portfolio, so hide it.\n\nIt is a very weak teaching experience,\nand people know that there there is minimal learning involved.\n\nJumping from high school to start-ups is more impressive,\nand shows that you chose knowledge over nonsense.\n\nIt shows that you chose to learn on your own,\nto take care of your own mind,\nrather than to pretend to learn for grades.\n\nAuthenticity is very important in life,\nit is hard to connect with people that role play.\n\nBonding with people that are just acting,\nis only functional for as long as they are acting.\n\nBut it is never good,\neventually they'll have a crisis, similar to a mid-life crisis.\n\nStay Authentic,\nkeep to to those who are Authentic.\n\nBe safe.\n\nWhen it feels like everyone else is having an amazing life,\nand you are stuck.\n\nUmm... that not true\n\nBut it is also not healthy to think this way about yourself,\nyou are not beneath the party goers, they don't have what you have in your mind.\n\nBut, that's far enough,\ntime to get some rest.\n\nThis is where it gets interesting,\nyou have primed your mind for Business.\n\nThat is a fine first step,\nnow you need to get ready for the real graduation.\n\nYou need to section hike the equivalent of the Appalachian Trail,\nand measure your jogging a hundred miles at a time.\n\nSection jogging, the Western States 100.\n\nMind and Body, for the rest of your life.\n\nYou must take good care of both.\n\nAt mile fifty, halfway through a run,\nas you piece together your blurry thoughts of your next business.\n\nTake some time to understand what it is that College Grads have,\nthose are very brittle relationships, and inflexible careers.\n\nWe all feel the promise, but we can't fake it,\nit would be the opposite, and certainly not worthy of you, my Friends.\n\nYou can only find your meaning in Authenticity,\nshortcuts will only take you back to the beginning.\n\nTo live among the Extraordinary,\nyou must become Extraordinary yourself.\n\nThe gateway to Meaning of Life,\nis in that tiny moment when you think to your self:\n\n\"I am not going to jog tonight, I need rest.\"\n\nRight there in that dot,\nis the keyhole,\nto the key that you are,\nto the gateway that you need to open.\n\nLife is not a simulation,\nthere are no days off,\nlife is quite a challenge,\nand demands that each moment builds on the authenticity of the previous.\n\nOpen the dot, how can you yearn for Authenticity and Companionship,\nand cancel, and fall short, and not enough, and rest some more.\n\nThe gateway between Ordinary and Extraordinary,\nis in accepting that we haven't got a choice to make.\n\nBut shoes... to put on,\nyour Mind and Body must grow in harmony.\n\nYou must not let go of the Harmony,\nof your Magnificent Existence.\n\nEach small success, by subtle analogy,\npushes you forward, to your next step.\n\nEventually your tightly controlled business failures,\nwill fail, they will, fail to fail.\n\nYour mind too,\nit won't perceive the easy choice as an option.\n\nAll- will proceed,\nin harmony.\n\nLabored breathing,\nby the Pine Trees at Western States,\n\nAnother great step in Automation of your business,\nand more investors.\n\nAnd you're no longer stopping at the first thing you find in books,\nyou understand all of it.\n\nWhat is made by humans,\nis also All Too Human.\n\nAnd the Bullies are Gone,\nand Eight Grade still sucks.\n\nHigh school ... influences,\nare trying to figure out where they went wrong - good luck!\n\nCollege, is still a very romantic idea,\nbut it is best left to imagination.\n\nYour dreams are so much more now,\nonly what you create can live up to them.\n\nYou are a Leader,\nfull of might an joy.\n\nAnd now you know,\nshortcuts only lead people to their beginnings.\n\nAnd the one road, the only road,\nwas the one of Authenticity, and Achievement.\n\nWhere we learned for real, not for grades,\nwhere what we learned added up to create wisdom, and not a stupid GPA.\n\nYou'll be OK, so as long as you Learn onward and become Wise,\nand Live in Authentic Harmony with Yourself.\n\nThis is how you become an Adult,\nthat was the one thing that all others were missing.\n\nIt's what made them pretend and simulate,\nbut, growing up can't be faked.\n\nGrowing up has to be written by the choices you make,\non the surface, that is your lifetime.\n\nThe dreams you always dream, will come true,\nbut not in your childhood, childhood is for learning.\n\nLive in Harmony with yourself,\nand live in harmony with the Universe.\n\nGrowing up is really special,\nit is really important for our health.\n\nIt is a deeply internal process,\nand there are no shortcuts to growing up.\n\nIt is meant to be,\nBeautiful.\n\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=content+management\n[2]:

You don't need a charging bear to learn.\nYou can use clay, or canvas, or music.\n\nThere is no finer way to push loneliness away,\nthan to sculpt the meaning of touch.\n\nAnd there is no better way to learn courage,\nthan to paint a chain of works that inspire to motion.\n\nAnd music need not make someone cry to be powerful,\nmake the beat move your own feet, as you run your first ultra.\n\nConsider how simple a Desktop in your Operating System is,\nand yet, how perfectly impossible it is, to drag the icon out of the computer.\n\nIt is right there, you can wiggle it,\nand yet it is trapped in a prison, of invisible walls.\n\nAnd consider, how different you are, from all the people you have met,\nhow you don't even smile at the things that make them laugh.\n\nHow not a single person out of the Eight Billion,\ncould possibly take your place.\n\nHow often it feels that all the people around you are sleepy,\nhow some seem different, because they could not do, what they do, if they were not wide awake.\n\nTo integrate with wisdom, you cannot read the same books others read,\nyour mind represents a perfectly unique constellation of stars.\n\nTo integrate with wisdom,\nnot only do you have to indirectly wiggle around by subtle analogy to other things.\n\nBut you have to fish out just the perfect morsels that fit you,\nin just the perfect sequence, out of a unique collection of mutually reinforcing works of Philosophy.\n\nYou start in the beginning, with Survey Courses, as these outline the most brilliant ideas first,\nthere you can recognize thoughts that fit you, that you already had in your constellation.\n\nOrganized Education, poisons your confidence in education, because everything they teach,\nis in an inhuman, synthetic, and impersonal sequence.\n\nMoreover, the easily forgotten and fragile clusters of incomplete information,\naim to build on one another, they guarantee you won't understand, and will only overwhelm you in the end.\n\nThe celebrating of a Diploma, is a sacred ritual, that has been erased, and replaced,\nwith a more sugarcoated \"I am finally out\".\n\nThis is a perfect recipe for bondage, blindness, weakness,\nand worse.\n\nWe must not allow a fake sugar pop triumph,\nto replace the Real Triumph or Knowledge and Wisdom.\n\nIt can only get worse,\na day will come when the Libraries will close.\n\nSchool and Library, above all, were meant to be a symbol,\nan extension to your own self education.\n\nYour Education,\nthe pathway to Peace, Safety, Security, Self Control, Harmony, Enlightenment.\n\nWhat has occurred to cause the fog, is a drop of packets of information,\nwe are too complex, the world is too complex, parenting is too complex, teaching is too complex.\n\nIt can get worse, if we continue celebrating false graduations, and fake education,\nif we keep forgetting that our family, has Eight Billion members and each must grow up for real.\n\nThe solution is to remind ourselves, that growing up is not about feeling like an adult,\nbut rather Transcending our Limits, and Pushing Through gaps, towards Wisdom.\n\nWe face problems that can only be solved by Intellectual or Cultural Unity.\n\nThe Problem of War, is solved by Education, Wisdom, and Unity.\n\nThe Problem of Education, is solved by Helping Everyone to a Fair Start.\n\nThe Problem of Crime, can be Solved by Mental Heath Care, and Prevention.\n\nThe Problem of Poverty and Slavery, is Solved by Universal Income.\n\nAll these problems are our problems, and the solutions are ours as well.\n\nBut they rest across a Gap, a gap that Humanity must cross.\n\nAnd the next step,\nis your step.\n\nNothing worth your precious time, can be faked, or made up, or make believe,\nit all has to be Authentic, Powerful, Guttural, Raw.\n\nIt will hurt in the Muscle and Bone,\nbut eventually you'll forget to pay attention to what is unimportant.\n\nYou are not to be taught that you are dime a dozen,\nand that they just can't find a job for you, because you don't fit or conform.\n\nPeople believe this nonsense,\nbecause they don't have anything to draw from by subtle analogy.\n\nThat is why we must challenge ourselves to Great Deeds,\nto acquire the experiences necessary to tell Wisdom from Waste.\n\nWhen you hear someone putting you down, pushing you around, belittling you,\nyou are to leave, because that someone has fractured and broke, and are now ill.\n\nIt is the oldest and sickest trick,\nto convince someone they don't matter.\n\nThey do it for personal gain, money or laziness,\nto people who do not have a library of Grand Experiences from which they can draw wisdom, by Subtle Analogy.\n\nGet Up.\n\nFind your temple of solitude, The Two Beautiful Trees, The Bridge Over Hudson River,\nThe Highway Overpass, The Starry Beach where the Stars Come Out at Night and mingle with Starfish.\n\nAnd know, that you are a Child of The Universe, first,\nThat! is your background.\n\nNow face Humanity anew,\nout from the edge of the Universe.\n\nLook,\nlook at all those things that made you small.\n\nLook how unimportant the inauthentic is,\nhow fragile those words that upset you really were.\n\nAnd pay attention, to the real problem,\nhow easily you were tricked and mislead.\n\nThat cannot go on,\nyou are not a push around.\n\nI wish you knew how Powerful you really are,\nhow easily you learn at your own pace in the sequence that fits you best.\n\nHow All Too Human, all too familiar, all too easy,\nthe acquisition of wisdom really is.\n\nNot all Adults are defined by Outspoken Wisdom, some find Greatness in Love Returned,\nand what a Great Power, can those Two even make a mistake?\n\nI don't think there is anything other than Love, that can substitute for Wisdom,\nit is both The Love of Two, and The Love of a Big Mother in a large family,\na Mother that always brings hugs, warm meals and Wisdom.\n\nBut, True Love is rare, so while you search, you must also grow in Wisdom,\nfrom now on, you will have to learn to tell the children apart from the adults.\n\nAnd not by looking at how old they are, or how well they dress, or how sharply they move in their environment,\nyou will now look at their Authenticity, and Content of Character.\n\nNo one who lacks in Authenticity, or has little Content of Character,\nhas anything to contribute to you life, certainly nothing negative.\n\nHope for them to recover, and become wise, and healthy,\nlet them know that they are a Child of The Universe, and they count - but go.\n\nDon't let anybody hurt you,\ndon't let anybody hurt your heart, or mind.\n\nGo!\nbecause you need your heart and mind, to grow.\n\nGo!,\nwith the certainty of knowing that you are more.\n\nGo!,\nso as long as you Rise you won't be lonely for long.\n\nGo!\nbecause there has never been a way other than forward and up.\n\nGo!\nand don't be scared, all great journeys start with little things.\n\nThe Others, who went through the same,\nare with you in Spirit.\n\nSo many invisible battles have been fought,\nand as much triumph gone unnoticed.\n\nThe Warriors are everywhere, and they stand by your side,\nyou are in company of Great Heroes.\n\nClimb by subtle analogy to the triumphs already had,\nrise to the highest of mountains.\n\nYou are Meant to Become a Great Being,\nand You are meant to remind others to follow a similar path.\n\nRise, and you will be well on your way,\nHumanity only grows, when people like you tear down those thin invisible walls.\n\nWherever you are right now, begin transcending your limits,\nno matter how small, each will help you learn more.\n\nWith each new success more pathways will become visible to you,\nyou are not trapped, you are just at the beginning of your journey.\n\nIt is hard to see it all because you are still learning,\nbut it is easy to read or listen to books, and inherit great visions from others.\n\nIt will never get easier,\nbut you will grow greater, to a point where ease will become irrelevant to your existence.\n\nYou must use your Heart and Mind to learn all the lessons ahead,\nno one can teach you, you must find your own books.\n\nBy Subtle Analogy,\nRise to Your Greatness.",

will help you see with great clarity.\n\nA Life of Wisdom.\n\nBut you must be careful,\nas the world may not yet be ready to help you.\n\nNot everyone will know about growing up,\nand people will say: \"How was I supposed to know?\"\n\nAnd they are not going to be the bad guys,\nand you will be inclined to listen to their advice.\n\nAnd the path will be paved with good intentions,\nit maybe the correct path, but it won't be the right one.\n\nPlease, focus on building your own self,\nyour strength, your wisdom, your power.\n\nFocus on building the best you,\nthe you that you are meant to be, that the world needs.\n\nBecause if you listen to everybody else,\nyou will not grow up, and they will blame you for not being able to help them.\n\nYou are not going to be able to explain to them,\nthat you are weak because of them,\nbecause you tried to help them too early.\n\nAnd if you could, all they could say will be:\n\"How was I supposed to know?\"\n\nPlease, you have no choice,\nbut to learn to control your own future.\n\nYou can try to use your imagination,\nto get in touch with your Elder Self;\n\nAnd ask \"What are your regrets?\",\n\"Where did it go wrong?\"\n\nPlease, carefully evaluate your choices,\nwisely build your Mind and Body.\n\nPay attention to all the choices you are making,\nas they dictate the Beautiful Life Ahead of You.\n\nThe teachers are not ready, we are not in the Era of Wisdom yet,\npeople are struggling to understand life.\n\nMany make choices that all too early box them in,\nand not all their advice will apply to you.\n\nNot all the things that you think box people in,\nactually constrain them, there are many contexts to all the paths.\n\nAll lives are beautiful, and there are enough forks in the road,\nfor people to navigate back to where they want to be.\n\nBut, when a mistake occurs, it will weigh you down for a time,\nif you are careful, you can avoid the worst of it.\n\nAnd whatever does happen, regardless of how hard you tried to avoid it,\nwill not crush you, because you will know you did your best.\n\nPlease, be careful in life, be beautiful, and strong,\nlearn, and think, and evaluate, and judge, and grow in wisdom.\n\nFollowing everyone's advice, will create a lot of noise,\nlistening to everything from everywhere will never align with you.\n\nYou must lean to pace yourself,\nand to carefully and wisely follow what interests you.\n\nYour mind is constantly asking questions,\nyour future depends on having a good intuition, rooted in reality, and in wisdom.\n\nThere is nothing you can be force-taught school,\nyou will not retain things that are out of sequence.\n\nReaching out for Knowledge and Wisdom in your own sequence, and at your own pace,\nis the only way to learn, and build steps, and build on top of those steps.\n\nNo one can decide what lesson you are ready for next,\nthat is something that comes from the complexity of your own mind.\n\nThose people who are doing well in school without cramming and memorization,\nhave previously arrived at those subjects in their own sequence.\n\nThe same applies to your job, your career,\nyour career needs to emerge from the path you were growing up with.\n\nIt needs to be an an extension of your pursuits,\nit must benefit you, and help you grow.\n\nJust like you must actually learn, instead of just getting grades,\nyour work must add to you, and not, rob you of your years.\n\nDo you understand the value of a Single Year of Your Precious Life?\nno one can put a price on that, not even you, there are not enough atoms in the Universe.\n\nThat is why Harmony with Education, and Work is so important,\neach year must be lived on the path that makes you grow.\n\nI am so sorry, that people will tell you to cram for tests,\nand get a job, and get on with life.\n\nI am so sorry, My Friends,\nbut that is the worst, you can do.\n\nThat's why you can't listen to anyone,\nthat's why you have to look into yourself.\n\nCarefully evaluate all decisions,\nwhilst carefully evaluating consequences, and being mindful of your future.\n\nYou are not alone, look to Memoirs, look to Biographies,\nlisten to Audiobooks, Explore, and Create.\n\nAnd you must take care of your body,\nthe best you can, at first.\n\nAnd with each year,\nyou will gain more, and add a bit more as you grow in Health and Fortitude.\n\nYour Elder Self needs to be Flexible, and Healthy,\nyou may never grunt and complain, that's something you have to be mindful of now.\n\nIt is not just about making choices for your Future,\nbut also for your body too.\n\nDo you see how going along with cramming for tests,\ncan put you in a field where your job makes life more stressful,\nwhich will prevent you from taking good care of your body?\n\nImagine the consequences of walking a path that is not truly your own,\nand what will your Elder Self feel when you two finally become, One?\n\nBe gentle with yourself,\nthis is Your Life, Your Beautiful-Beautiful Life.\n\nPut down the incomprehensible Text Book, the standardized tests,\nand find an Audiobook that you will love and actually learn from.\n\nStop trying to find a job or get hired, and become the kind of a person;\nthat companies can only hope to hire.\n\nStart living healthy, years before you start your training,\ndo not force your body into endurance, gradually teach it to adapt.\n\nChose Audio-books that really help your wisdom grow,\nembrace your hobbies, and expand your adventures.\n\nIf you can't find a career path that will add onto you,\nthen start your own company,\nor become a co-founder.\n\nTake care of your body, be mindful of you Body Mass Index,\nbut also aim to become a Healthy Athlete, Heath will never take away from you.\n\nIn all we do, in choices, or intuitions,\nwe re driven by the wisdom we have thus far acquired.\n\nA decision that made sense in your youth,\nmay reverse, as you gain wisdom from Books and Experiences.\n\nThe richer our Pursuit of Wisdom,\nthe more in-tune our decision-making.\n\nWisdom surrounds Education, Carrier and Health,\nit influences your Private Decision-making, and thus Your Future.\n\nIn most contexts Wisdom is the most important thing,\nwhat can be more important than the thing that influences your private decision making?\n\nAnd be mindful that your decision making is in turn,\nthe very thing that influences all the future ahead of you?\n\nThe beginning of your Knowledge and Wisdom is found in the things you love as a child,\nin a way those things are questions, and playing with them brings answers.\n\nBut you have to stay with it,\nprotect the natural progression of the chain of your curiosities.\n\nYou have to understand the the Destructive Power of:\n\"cram, get a job, and get on with your life\".\n\nWe don't live in a world that can support your Pursuit of Wisdom,\nfor most, the world will give minimums, for many nothing.\n\nWhen we try to create external machinery,\nit will often perform the minimum.\n\nThe power for the world to change,\nis within each of its Citizens.\n\nIt is found in decision making,\nperpetually strengthened by Unrelenting Pursuit of wisdom.\n\nWe create this world together,\nand it can only grow, when we grow.\n\n\n[find]: https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/130.Best_Audiobooks_Ever\n[start your own

to remind us that the World is Not Static,\nthat it grows, moves, changes, and cares not to stop for things writ on paper.\n\nAdvancements in Psychology... the trailer to the movie about Philip Zimbardo work -

      "text": "We are not Island Universes scattered to no end in some void,\nwe are a part of a growing civilization with a past and a future.\n\nAnd we might have become confused about the Scope of Our Existence,\nwe stand divided by borders and committed to repeating history's mistakes.\n\nIt is unwise to pretend to be able to handle a great responsibility,\nonly desperation, fractures, and exploitation by other desperate pretenders can follow.\n\nThose who are granted authority are often not wise enough to handle it,\nand in their mediocrity they commit what in larger scope translates to real Crimes Against Humanity.\n\nThere cannot be wisdom without understanding and inheriting from past generations,\nthe transfer of knowledge occurs by means of Understanding Books.\n\nAnd there cannot be understanding without Authenticity,\nin haste of chasing a career there can only be memorization and misunderstanding.\n\nWe must keep in mind; that what the future generations do not perceive as clear progress,\nwill be seen as the continuation of dark ages with authorities on the wrong side of history.\n\nThe World United, is not a fairy-tale, nor should it be a mere dream for us,\nbut a Gift of Peace for The Future Generations, so that they may grow in Dignity, Health, and Wisdom.\n\nWe are neither disconnected from the future generations, nor the past generations,\nwe are a stepping stone in the development of The Human Kind.\n\nAnd we should recognize this Great Honor and Reward,\nand understand that the larger context is found in helping to build a better world for future generations.\n\nAll our decisions, across all levels and authorities,\nPolice, Attorneys and Judges, Parents, Teachers and Principals, Mayors, Governors, Prime Misters and Presidents, and everybody else...\n\nMust be mindful of future generations, of a growing world, of making lasting and meaningful contributions to the entire human kind,\na World that will eventually become united and free of borders.\n\nA world with future generations that will look back at us,\nright now, right here, with questions that we must present answers to.\n\nWe are getting stuck in circles,\nbecause people are forgetting history's lessons.\n\nBecause we are not thinking on a large enough scale,\nwe end up building more prisons rather than ending poverty with meaningful prevention programs.\n\nEndless cycles of heartless poverty that freeze the best of us,\npoverty that wouldn't even be a feature of modern society had we in our wisdom recognized it for what it is.\n\nPoverty denies people food and well being,\ncauses stress and great harm to mind and body.\n\nLove above Law, before we allow the practice of law,\nwe must end the cycles of poverty.\n\nMoney must not be used to limit people,\nit is meant to help.\n\nAnd how can a culture be to fail to see, how a young person allowed to build a business without the threat of homelessness and starvation,\nwill contribute back to the city and everyone's well being.\n\nWhat is so hard about seeing that rather than sending non-violent criminals to prison,\nwe can prevent their biggest mistakes by putting an end to their worries of sleeping hungry on the street.\n\nAny time, we fail to keep to reality,\nbe it sending a 15 year old lady to prison, or denying science, or tolerating arrests by obscured or unidentified agencies, or abuses of power or discretion.\n\nWe create fractures and distrust,\nblindly defacing and destroying work of many much wiser great beings, who gave their best trusting that we can carry on, in wisdom.\n\nWe must not move against the grain of reality,\nany and all divergence will only create a cascade of fractures that will demand constant attention\nand result in nothing more than systems that merely stand to support themselves and as an affront to justice and future generations.\n\nWhere there was once a solution as clear as helping children to inherit the wisdom of their elders,\nwe now see the emergence of a failed and impotent educational system with a mass incarceration backed.\n\nWisdom and inheritance of knowledge cannot be replaced by a \"fake it until you make it\" trickery,\nthe work of great beings must not be stained by people who fail to see their vision.\n\nOnce again, the world grows a generation at a time,\nthe education of the teenagers from 20 years ago is currently influencing the state of the world.\n\nLikewise, how we treat out children today,\nwill have a monumental impact on the world 20 years from now.\n\nLet us honor our children and all the future generations by encouraging them to books,\nby reminding them of the Great Power of Thinking Beings, of Philosophers and Lovers of Wisdom.\n\nBy reminding them that their Pursuit of Excellence,\ncan only make the world a better place for us all, and even those that are yet to come.\n\nLet us remind them that Books (and now Audio Books) serve as a wonderful source of our wisdom,\nespecially when read in a sequence that fits them best, and understood at thier own pace.\n\nLet us remind each other that we must reject short thinking and shortest paths,\nthat do not help the world grow and keep us divided.\n\nLet us break out of that selfish endless loop of repeating mistakes of past generations,\nby working towards a better world a more united world where we recognize each other as One Family.\n\nAnd let us remember that the great and wise beings of past generations,\ndemand that we honor hard won triumphs and do not repeat history's mistakes.\n\nThe very nature of that demand requires that once we take to wisdom,\nwe must stop following orders, and begin thinking, evaluating, and judging for ourselves.\n\nTo honor triumphs and guard against heartbreaking mistakes,\nis the duty we hold to those who came before us,\nand all the future generations that are yet to follow.\n\nAs children we are asked to listen and follow,\nas we grow we must learn to Lead and become Unbreakable.\n\nIt is not just the challenges of life that will test us,\nwe must also think and evaluate and reject that which is wrong.\n\nWe are constantly made to listen and expected to follow,\nlook behind any protest, or scandal, or angry headline.\n\nWe must judge all the contradictory information for ourselves,\nand make an informed decision as to whether or not majority is correct.\n\nLife will always challenge us,\nand My Goodness - times are always changing.\n\nHumanity is constantly bettering her self,\nwhat used to be acceptable - may now, be an affront to justice.\n\nAnd while there isn't enough time to comprehend all the books,\nthere is plenty of time to be come a Loving and Wise Compassionate Human Being,\n\nLet us remember that we are a chain-link between the Hard Work of Past Generations,\nand the United, Free from Poverty, and Peaceful Word of Future Generations.\n\nWe are One Growing Family, and that is the correct context for

If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.\",\nI was as cautions as a cat not to let a day go by withut doing something important.\n\nAnd now I heard a world celebrated Philosopher say the same,\nin a book from 1850, a book written by a man that shared some of his strength with Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nA man I lovingly call Henry,\nI think of him as my friend in time.\n\nHenry David Thoreau is a friend to us all,\nhe used to think about us, about making life better for us, the future generations.\n\nI was at Ambrosia in Ann Arbor,\nThough I wasn't a regular, I spent a lot of time there when it was empty and I could be alone later at night.\n\nI started keeping a folder of ideas and poems,\nI've noticed really beautiful people going to the sports bar next door.\n\nI tried to ignore the song that was playing as it was frightening me,\nthe lyrics rang \"Where'd you get your body from, I got it from my moma.\"\n\nA couple of regulars gathered by and inquired about my paperwork,\nand I thought it was prime time, to tell them word for word.\n\nI begun by reading Kosmos by Walt Whitman,\nI remember finishing with such a flourish that one of my listeners staggered back.\n\nKosmos (Written in 1860 by Walt Whitman)\n\nWho includes diversity and is Nature,\nWho is the amplitude of the earth, and the coarseness and sexuality of the earth, and the great charity of the earth and the equilibrium also,\nWho has not look’d forth from the windows the eyes for nothing, or whose brain held audience with messengers for nothing,\nWho contains believers and disbelievers, who is the most majestic lover,\nWho holds duly his or her triune proportion of realism, spiritualism, and of the æsthetic or intellectual,\nWho having consider’d the body finds all its organs and parts good,\nWho, out of the theory of the earth and of his or her body understands by subtle analogies all other theories,\nThe theory of a city, a poem, and of the large politics of these States;\nWho believes not only in our globe with its sun and moon, but in other globes with their suns and moons,\nWho, constructing the house of himself or herself, not for a day but for all time, sees races, eras, dates, generations,\nThe past, the future, dwelling there, like space, inseparable together.\n\nI actually I had to stop the person from leaving,\n\"One more\" - I asked, nay commanded, demanded, just to share Ayn's Vision of John Galt, and I begun:\n\n\"Your destroyers hold you by means of your endurance, your generosity, your innocence, your love\nthe endurance that carries their burdens\nthe generosity that responds to their cries of despair\nthe innocence that is unable to conceive of their evil and gives them the benefit of every doubt, refusing to condemn them without understanding and incapable of understanding such motives as theirs\nthe love, your love of life, which makes you believe that they are men and that they love it, too.\" (from John Galt's Speech from Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand)\n\nI remember I wasn't able to finish my listeners fidgeted and had to go,\nI didn't belong in Ann Arbor, I didn't really belong at Ambrosia, the truth was I didn't belong anywhere anymore.\n\nI remember someone asking me where I was from, what country;\nand as I rolled up my poems getting ready to leave,\n\n\"I am a Citizen of the World.\" - I said without thinking anything of it.\n\nI remember sitting up one time feeling really alone,\nI think I was headed up to Ludington this time.\n\nAnd time came to listen to Viktor E. Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning,\nbullies came after me when I was a chubby child.\n\nOne year sometime when I was 13 maybe,\nthe little me made the older me make a promise.\n\nI was to return to that damn classrom in my imagination,\nand sit right next to my younger self, and keep him company so that he is not scared anymore.\n\nI kept that promise,\nbut from time to time I also visit Dr. Frankl, I sit by his bed to keep him company too.\n\nThere is a very powerful description of Great Beings in his book,\nit is something that we should each remember.\n\n\"We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others,\ngiving away their last piece of bread.\n\nThey may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing:\nthe last of the human freedoms -- to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.\"\n\nThe book I have read the most times is \"A Short History of Nearly Everything\" by Bill Bryson,\nit is a book that begins with an honest journey to find out more about the world.\n\nIt is very helpful to realize that we don't know all the things we should know,\nand not be ashamed of that, just simply look for some Audio Books on the subject.\n\nI write this in 2020 in the middle of the Pandemic,\nand there is a lot of misled people, people who got taken in by false information.\n\nIn my memory Carl Sagan in his \"The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark\"\nmentions something similar on the subject of Aliens and UFOs.\n\nHe says that there is more beauty and interesting things in the actual Science,\nthan fantasizing stories of visiting aliens and flying saucers.\n\nWhen I was a teenager I was a huge fan of shows like the X-Files,\nand I remember walking into a mighty New York Public Library to crack the case, once and fall all,\n\nNut instead falling in love with Mokele-mbembe, I recognized the creature from my first Science book \"Wszechświat życie człowiek\" published in 1955,\nit was a Brontosaurus, and I instantly fell in love with the idea there there might be a few left in Rhodesia.\n\nFor the world to carry on becoming more and more United,\nwe have to become Great Lovers of Knowledge and take to Books and Audio Books.\n\nThe treasures withing are unlike anything we have heard of in school,\nthe books that we end up loving and carrying with us for the rest of our lives, make us better.\n\nAnd there is never an end to learning for real,\nevery few weeks a new book comes out that you didn't even know you were waiting for.\n\nIt becomes a source of Wisdom, or just sheer joy as the case is with Randall Munroe's\nWhat If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions.\n\nMy Dear Friends, I wish you the discovery of new poems, new quotes,\nnew books and video lectures, authors you will love for live and then some.\n\nAnd don't worry, the world is coming together, the borders are fading, and there is noting that can stop that,\nHumanity is in the process of Unifying to become One Loving Family.\n\nWe can hasten this process by learning, acquiring more knowledge,\npreventing history's mistakes from repeating themselves.\n\nThe path to the future is found In Knowledge and Wisdom,\nand aiming for Greatness of Soul, Heart, and Mind.\n\n\n[Mokele-mbembe]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mokele-mbembe",

man builds irrigation canals;\nif a flood strikes them, animals perish - man builds dams;\nif a carnivorous pack attacks them, animals perish - man writes the Constitution of the United States.\"\n\nWe are struck by a culture that does not fully represent reality,\nbut we will not jump from the cliff, we will not merely age - business as usual.\n\nWe will learn, we will teach ourselves to become genius,\nthe easy-peasy way, by going on long adventures with a bunch of wise non-fiction books.\n\nWhen our planet comes under attack, it will not perish,\nfor it holds a species of animal that can perceive it self, alter, and rise to heights unseen.\n\nAll it takes,\nis for us to notice, that something is wrong.\n\nPerhaps, taking it easy, would be OK,\nif you were not capable, of becoming a Great Being.\nif you were not a Genius, and a Powerful Thinker.\n\nIf you were unable to rise, to Inspire Generations,\nto save the Planet for all the Children yet to be born,\nand to repair schools so that they help humanity progress.\n\nBut ultimately taking it easy, can't be OK,\nbecause that would disappoint the one person that truly does have all the authority over you,\nthat you really do not want to disappoint, in any way.\n\nYour Elder Self...\n\nYour elder self, will be incredibly disappointed in you,\nif you fail to quickly shed all the stupid things sneaked into you by mis-education and questionable culture.\n\nYour elder self, will be incredibly disappointed in you,\nif you fail to learn to unfold your wings as a genius, and an intellectual.\n\nYour elder self, will be incredibly disappointed in you,\nif you fail to rise out of loneliness and isolation.\n\nYour elder self, will be seriously pissed off,\nif you mess this up.\n\nYour elder self will know exactly who you could have become,\nand where you made the wrong decisions that prevented you from becoming the person that they wish to be.\n\nMy Friends,\nI wish there was more I could to to help you believe that you are each a genius.\n\nBut I can only give you the books.\n\nI can't put the ear-buds in your ears and press play,\nbecause to hear the books you have to slow down in life,\nyou have to begin questioning the things that were driving you,\nand you have to become ready to listen,\nand by that time you can press play on your own.\n\nA genius is not an intellectual anomaly,\neven Savants spend years mastering their tricks.\n\nWe are all capable of gaining Powerful Intelligence,\nand we don't need schools for that,\njust a mountain of down to earth books made heavy with lifetimes of wisdom.\n\nYou don't need to memorize Mathematical Formulas,\nand the last place you want to learn about Biology, is Biology.\n\nWhat you need is stories that teach you about the reasons behind the invention of mathematics,\nand and an adventure where you re-invent mathematics from scratch, with the fantastic and magical ability to look some stuff up along the way.\n\nYou don't need to learn about the powerhouse of the cell,\nyou need to begin with Stromatolites, Panspermia, Evolution and Astrobiology.\nMitochondria used to be a separate organism, what an adventure to follow, what an honor to make new discoveries on that path.\n\nMy Friends,\n\nYou must begin your education by pushing everything that interferes with your Natural Genius away,\neven if it is the city you live in, or school you are forced to go to.\n\nAnd you must begin your life, knowing that you are a Powerful Genius,\nin dire need for more books and audio books that will fuel your Wisdom.\n\nAs I write this,\nthere are only 3,900 tigers left.\n\nPlease, believe in your genius, and grow, my friend,\nit is not just the tigers that need help,\nthe task at hand if far greater.\n\nWith ten million people in cages around the word,\nwe have to help children and students of today,\nout of poverty, and towards real education,\nso that they may have a chance at a fair start in life.",

we may turn around and begin moving in the opposite one.\n\nThe more we know, the better we navigate,\na powerful intermediate solution to this problem is Non-Fiction Audio Books,\nMemoirs and Biographies about Growing Up and Learning.\n\nThe Problem of Content of Culture, more specifically Cultural Indoctrination.\n\nIs in observations of the surrounding world,\nand hopes of living a meaningful existence in harmony with it.\n\nIf we are taught a falsehood about the world,\nwe will make decisions, of our own free will, that will be wrong.\n\nA good example of that is the propaganda of warring tribes or nations,\nteaching their children that the other is evil.\n\nIt is very difficult to catch ourselves as being under control of a cultural falsehood,\nwe tend to accept the culture we are born into, as a source of absolute truth.\n\nLet me give you an example,\nthat your mind will actively work to reject, paragraph by paragraph.\n\nWhen we went to school we were convinced it would teach us knowledge,\neven though nearly every month there was more and more evidence to the contrary.\n\nNo matter what,\nwe still believed.\n\nWe saw unfair grading, bullies and violence, hate, racism and indifference,\nwe saw that everyone was cheating by cramming, and that teachers loved it.\n\nWe saw many kids get into drugs and alcohol,\nsome of us even foresaw that some of the staff were predators looking for prey.\n\nWe accepted grades,\nand we accepted it as a measure of our intelligence.\n\nWe accepted grades, knowing about cheating by cramming, and knowing about unfair grading,\nwe still though of ourselves as B or C, or D level humans.\n\nIn the end we saw, that everything we gained, we gained by working on our own,\nand finally noticed that a diploma didn't even guarantee a well-paying job.\n\nLate on in life many of us noticed that many schools are not a source of knowledge,\nbut a source of regret, a force of erosion.\n\nMany of us became so confused, that we immediately assumed we were wrong,\nand never said a single bad thing about schools.\n\nThe tragedy of organized education,\nis a good example of the Overwhelming Power of Cultural Indoctrination.\n\nNow let us take a look at Authenticity and Pursuits of Excellence with a bit more detail, as those two combine to help with both\nThe Problem of Knowing Enough and The Problem of Cultural Indoctrination.\n\nAuthenticity.\n\nAccept authenticity the way you accepted Dignity, and Goodness, and Class.\nthat's how you become more sensitive to inconsistencies that are surrounding you.\n\nNext time you ask yourself, am I classy, and I a good person, am I a dignified person,\nalso ask; am I an authentic person that lives an authentic existence.\n\nDignity, and Goodness, and Class, are things we strengthen in our Soul and Heart as we grow,\nnow add Authenticity to help you see a little bit better.\n\nOften times when our intent is noble, but results end up wrong,\nit means that we were purposefully misled.\n\nWith Authenticity in our Heart,\nwe get an extra moment to ourselves.\n\nIn context of education, if a teacher is forcing you to cram for tests so you get good grades,\nyou are more likely to walk out and talk to the Dean, or Principal.\n\nNo longer will you feel compelled to cram,\nbecause it will feel inauthentic.\n\nAfter all, faking test results by means of cramming, or temporary memorization,\nis not what you intended when signing up for school, it is something you were pressured into.\n\nAuthenticity presents many more challenges in life than just going along with everyone else,\nbecause one of the strong points of moving along with the surrounding culture, is that it is easier to move with the flow and play by the rules.\n\nHowever, the price we pay for ease,\nis that we don't really learn anything, we just pretend to learn.\n\nPursuits of Excellence are by definition difficult, and challenging, however they result in Real Knowledge, a Real Functional Education.\nYou start with Audio Books, Video Lectures, Survey Courses and learn with whatever means are at your disposal.\n\nThis is more challenging, than cramming for tests,\nbut this is not difficult because you are working with material you love, with knowledge that touches and moves you.\n\nThe reward for Standing in Relentless Pursuit of Excellence and Authentic Achievement,\nis the Complete Knowledge of the subject you Love.\n\nIf that takes you to a Science, Medical, Technology or Engineering School,\nor a Startup Accelerator, or your own company from zero.\n\nThen you are faced with a much smaller challenge, there is no more cramming, or pretending,\nas you are now filled with Athletic Knowledge from across thousands of books.\n\nKnowledge that you connected in a sequence that served you best,\nand at a pace that helped you retain most.\n\nAuthenticity and Pursuits of Excellence,\nput us on a path to becoming Wiser Beings.\n\nThey will help you see in a world obscured by indoctrination,\nor one that lacks real education.\n\n\n[tragedy of organized education]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCbdS4hSa0s\n[Startup Accelerator]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=What+is+a+Startup+Accelerator",

G. Wells, Mark Twain, Mary Shelley, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.\n\n...And uhh... you know, (and this is just between you and me),\nyou could uhh... spice up the slower, dryer parts of said books.\n\nYou know, mistakes happen, you could for example mix up Mary Shelley's Frankenstein\nwith H. G.

public institutions anywhere\",\nit is too easy for bad people to, not just subvert, but erase lifetimes of hard work and dedication.\n\nIt is commonly known as corruption, but that didn't matter to them,\nbecause they were not attempting to fix things, they had an idea how to replace everything.\n\nAnd by everything,\nthey meant institutions all around the world.\n\nThey were going to begin in the beginning, Henry Ford once said,\n\"If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.\",\n\nThe idea was that if they went to the Courts, Police or Schools,\nthey would have wanted the wrong things, that would only invite more problems.\n\nInitially nobody knew how immune to corruption the thing was going to be,\nbut there was a way to find out.\n\nThe thing was a game, it was meant to be a simulation of a city,\nit was a simple program that used simple web design principles to simulate a city.\n\nThe non playable characters, were little bots that would interact with the player,\nthe bots were crafted to simulate officials, and they interacted with web pages the way a user would.\n\nSo part of the reason why the programming was so simple,\nis that bots needed a simple way to pretend to be humans.\n\nWhen everything went online players would sign up to take over for the bots,\nand some of the initial testing was about corrupting the institutions of the city.\n\nThe thinking was that, if it was not possible for players to corrupt an institution,\nthen the program could replace all the management software of a real city.\n\nTo their surprise there was a number of cities that were willing to participate in the trials,\nit took them a better part of a decade to get everything going, but the initial trials worked.\n\nThey knew that they became famous,\nwhen the UN wouldn't stop calling.\n\nIt worked because they kept insisting on simplicity,\nthey kept using bots, and corruption simulation teams for decades.\n\nThe program was adopted by almost all the cities of the world,\nabout 10,000 running copies.\n\nWhat was fascinating about this,\nis that it was still played as a game.\n\nThere was a Virtual Cyberpunk City,\nthat everyone went to for internet news.\n\nThe program relies on plain HTTP, REST, and HTML\nand to make it operate well on $30 Android Tablets it uses little client-side scripting.\n\nIt is a Virtual City at heart,\nbut when players start mapping out real homes, and roads, and the citizens join in,\nit inflates to become a virtual representation of a real city.\n\nPeople can vote in elections, and there is no real threat of corruption here,\nbecause their voting history is under their profile.\n\nElections, that was one of the things that got a huge upgrade in many of the cities around the world,\nsome cities just vote on ideas that need to get done, they don't vote on representatives anymore.\n\nThe program as a whole,\neliminated the need for representatives.\n\nPeople vote on issues that need immediate attention,\nand those are the first issues that get solved.\n\nTwo amazing things emerged from within the program,\nschools begun working for the students by providing them with Audio Books, Lectures, and Chat (that's what the teachers are called),\nand the trail of programs that students select over the course of their teenage years actually becomes their resume.\n\nSchools started working,\nit was Rebirth and Enlightenment of both the citizens and the cities.\n\nThe second,\npeople could work on tasks logged by the users of the program.\n\nSome tasks like taking care of public gardens could result in users getting monthly tips from their community,\npeople loved being able to give the lady down the street $8/mo. for making sure all the flower beds were taken care of,\nthe lady next door was often bringing in $3,200 per month for something that she would do anyway, people loved her.\n\nOther tasks like road work, could get a bounty, bounties basically ensured that all the road work was done,\nany competent company could claim a task and grab the bounty for a pothole.\n\nPeople would setup an tiny Limited Liability Company and stock up on compatible materials, and wait for roadwork tasks,\nthere were no more delays to get things done, and these bounties could grow fast.\n\nAll this was tested in the games before cities adopted the program,\nso everyone knew what they were getting, and the stuff just worked.\n\nThere was an interesting phenomenon where automated programs would actually stay in place of people,\none of the most well know instances dealt with the prison population, in a small Swiss city.\n\nThe entire process was often ran by bots,\ncity was able to vote on presets, this eliminated the need for many local Judges.\n\nIn this particular instance all the folks who got into fights,\nwere automatically given community service, duration of which would increase with each repeated offense under the same category,\nthe community service program was actually a well paying program, the users didn't want people to go to jail,\nthey wanted the troublemakers to get a job.\n\nWords like felon and criminal were not used, people in the community had access to their entire education,\nthey could see into hearts and souls of these users, the books, pursuits, and curiosities of their teenage years were right there.\n\nPsychologists were able to build up a new spectrum disorder, that emerged from stress, loss, fear, isolation.\n\nThe Swiss town actually ended up closing most of it's prisons.\n\nIn America, a similar system of automated programs resulted in a lot of convictions being overturned.\n\nThis was a prison management system where the inmates were able to present their case in a way that the citizens would understand from a more humane perspective,\nagain the entire past of that person was right there, tragedies and loss, and stress would be followed by more misfortune, deteriorating mental condition, desperate self medication\nto get back to a thinking state, and what was once called a Felon or Criminal, once again became a Human, a Brother, a Son, a Daughter, a Mother.\n\nPrison population dropped.\n\nNobody called this program a game,\nit was always meant to change the world.\n\nThe cities were always connected together to form a larger Global Metropolis,\noriginally it helped people with jobs, as users could tell where they could find tasks that fit them best,\n\nBut now, decades after the initial release;\nthe program begun uniting the world.\n\nWar, for one became unthinkable,\nas people could see how the well being of even one city affected all the others.\n\nThere was no such thing as not having a job,\nthe cities always needed help with countless tasks.\n\nCorruption had nowhere to hide, the crooked politicians had nowhere to hide,\nnational borders made little economic sense, and Climate Change stopped being an issue by 2030.\n\nNot that they cared for rewards, but The Women behind the program,\nthe original programmers, received Purple Hearts and multiple Nobel Peace Prizes.\n\nWhat they did love was the fact that the United Nations regained a certain vitality,\nsomething that they discovered was once lost in the translation.\n\nEvery city now has a sculpture to honor them.\nMany of their sculptures bear the words they uttered so many times during the initial development, \"Faster Horses\".\n\nIn closing, the conjecture was true.\nIn the haste of life, people, often out of desperation, will try to meet goals by exploiting systems without active countermeasures.\nThe only system that can resist corruption and exploitation, is one designed from ground up to resist it.\n\nIt takes a computer to create a a corruption-resistant scaffold around the matters of a city.\nWhere there is no room for stretching rules, the participants can only be encouraged to take the correct paths.",

class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>What was fascinating about this,</p>\n  <p>is that it was still played as a game.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>There was a Virtual Cyberpunk City,</p>\n  <p>that everyone went to for internet news.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The program relies on plain HTTP, REST, and HTML</p>\n  <p>and to make it operate well on $30 Android Tablets it uses little client-side scripting.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It is a Virtual City at heart,</p>\n  <p>but when players start mapping out real homes, and roads, and the citizens join in,</p>\n  <p>it inflates to become a virtual representation of a real city.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>People can vote in elections, and there is no real threat of corruption here,</p>\n  <p>because their voting history is under their profile.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Elections, that was one of the things that got a huge upgrade in many of the cities around the world,</p>\n  <p>some cities just vote on ideas that need to get done, they don&apos;t vote on representatives anymore.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The program as a whole,</p>\n  <p>eliminated the need for representatives.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>People vote on issues that need immediate attention,</p>\n  <p>and those are the first issues that get solved.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Two amazing things emerged from within the program,</p>\n  <p>schools begun working for the students by providing them with Audio Books, Lectures, and Chat (that&apos;s what the teachers are called),</p>\n  <p>and the trail of programs that students select over the course of their teenage years actually becomes their resume.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Schools started working,</p>\n  <p>it was Rebirth and Enlightenment of both the citizens and the cities.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The second,</p>\n  <p>people could work on tasks logged by the users of the program.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Some tasks like taking care of public gardens could result in users getting monthly tips from their community,</p>\n  <p>people loved being able to give the lady down the street $8/mo. for making sure all the flower beds were taken care of,</p>\n  <p>the lady next door was often bringing in $3,200 per month for something that she would do anyway, people loved her.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Other tasks like road work, could get a bounty, bounties basically ensured that all the road work was done,</p>\n  <p>any competent company could claim a task and grab the bounty for a pothole.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>People would setup an tiny Limited Liability Company and stock up on compatible materials, and wait for roadwork tasks,</p>\n  <p>there were no more delays to get things done, and these bounties could grow fast.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>All this was tested in the games before cities adopted the program,</p>\n  <p>so everyone knew what they were getting, and the stuff just worked.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>There was an interesting phenomenon where automated programs would actually stay in place of people,</p>\n  <p>one of the most well know instances dealt with the prison population, in a small Swiss city.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The entire process was often ran by bots,</p>\n  <p>city was able to vote on presets, this eliminated the need for many local Judges.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In this particular instance all the folks who got into fights,</p>\n  <p>were automatically given community service, duration of which would increase with each repeated offense under the same category,</p>\n  <p>the community service program was actually a well paying program, the users didn&apos;t want people to go to jail,</p>\n  <p>they wanted the troublemakers to get a job.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Words like felon and criminal were not used, people in the community had access to their entire education,</p>\n  <p>they could see into hearts and souls of these users, the books, pursuits, and curiosities of their teenage years were right there.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Psychologists were able to build up a new spectrum disorder, that emerged from stress, loss, fear, isolation.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The Swiss town actually ended up closing most of it&apos;s prisons.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In America, a similar system of automated programs resulted in a lot of convictions being overturned.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>\n    This was a prison management system where the inmates were able to present their case in a way that the citizens would understand from a more humane perspective,</p>\n  again the entire past of that person was right there, tragedies and loss, and stress would be followed by more misfortune, deteriorating mental condition, desperate self medication\n  to get back to a thinking state, and what was once called a Felon or Criminal, once again became a Human, a Brother, a Son, a Daughter, a Mother.<p></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Prison population dropped.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Nobody called this program a game,</p>\n  <p>it was always meant to change the world.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The cities were always connected together to form a larger Global Metropolis,</p>\n  <p>originally it helped people with jobs, as users could tell where they could find tasks that fit them best,</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But now, decades after the initial release;</p>\n  <p>the program begun uniting the world.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>War, for one became unthinkable,</p>\n  <p>as people could see how the well being of even one city affected all the others.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>There was no such thing as not having a job,</p>\n  <p>the cities always needed help with countless tasks.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Corruption had nowhere to hide, the crooked politicians had nowhere to hide,</p>\n  <p>national borders made little economic sense, and Climate Change stopped being an issue by 2030.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Not that they cared for rewards, but The Women behind the program,</p>\n  <p>the original programmers, received Purple Hearts and multiple Nobel Peace Prizes.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>What they did love was the fact that the United Nations regained a certain vitality,</p>\n  <p>something that they discovered was once lost in the translation.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Every city now has a sculpture to honor them.</p>\n  <p>Many of their sculptures bear the words they uttered so many times during the initial development, &quot;Faster Horses&quot;.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In closing, the conjecture was true.</p>\n  <p>In the haste of life, people, often out of desperation, will try to meet goals by exploiting systems without active countermeasures.</p>\n  <p>The only system that can resist corruption and exploitation, is one designed from ground up to resist it.</p>\n  <p>\n  </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It takes a computer to create a a corruption-resistant scaffold around the matters of a city.</p>\n  <p>Where there is no room for stretching rules, the participants can only be encouraged to take the correct paths.</p>\n</div>",

had its first article,\ncosmopolis now held the first city: http://localhost:3000/view/night_city\n\nThis was both exiting and terrifying, this program was meant to bring peace to the world.\nand they only had a blank page for an imaginary city.\n\nAdding user support had to come in next,\njust like every city had a page, so did every user.\n\nThus, Night City would receive its first two citizens,\nAlice and Bob.\n\nOut in the server room the admin was already preparing for corruption simulations,\nand she named the malicious politician Mallory.\n\nAlice and Bob represented computer

sample script of github's hubot.\n\nThe bots were special,\nthey greatly simplified simulations and reasoning about this virtual test city.\n\nAs a whole they already created a very simple,\nbut living simulation.\n\nFor example one internal bot would be responsible for generating weather in Night City,\nthe bot actually got its information from Detroit's own weather service.\n\nAnd our

working on the system fun.\n\nBut by far the most special thing about bots,\nwas that they could be replaced by a real human,\nby a person that would turn off the bot and log in into their account.\n\nIn the next release of the program,\nthe girls focused on enhancing this feature.\n\nA bot could be instructed to ship groceries from Amazon,\nbut when a real person took over for an account,\nthey could go to a local store and buy and deliver the groceries for a small payment.\n\nEven in the early tests, it was becoming more an more obvious,\nthat a powerful automated framework that could help people make money could be built.\n\nAs with every program the girls were worried about its adoption,\nbut it was universally agreed that people would join to make money,\nand in the end large cities would go online within weeks,\nbecause it helped people put food on the table by trading small services.\n\nCosmopolis 2.0 was what got the attention of United Nations,\nbut that is a story for another time.\n\nPersonal Note,\n\nBecoming a programmer is not that hard, and when you have a dream like our story of Cosmopolis here,\nit becomes a fun hobby that you just aimlessly poke at when there is some time in a day.\n\nThere is a tradition of creating Programming Cook-books, they are books tailored for a specific language,\nthat contain short recipes, and it is really fun to

of Nuclear War,\nthe models predicted the war as 100% certain.\n\nThis is what happens, when one generation passes onto the next,\nMutually Assured Destruction.\n\nIt didn't take computer models,\nit didn't require an imagination,\nwar only needs time, guns and borders.\n\nFor uneducated humans, war is a certainty,\nwar is where we all come from.\n\nThe models predicted that it would take decades,\nnearly a century to reach a stable disarmament.\n\nOne of the greatest problems that Humanity faces is born of group cohesion,\nwhen we lived in tribes automatic self-indoctrination ensured tribe stability.\n\nWhen the world connected,\naccepting the cultures and beliefs of the local group we were born into, divided us from the rest creating a border.\n\nThe threat of nuclear war grew, and it was not disarmament,\nbut leaving all the bad ideas behind, that would make all the difference.\n\nAbandoning invisible indoctrination and leaving imperceptibly-bad ideas behind,\ncan only occur on generation by generation level.\n\nThe generations with cultures holding bad ideas needed to retire out of old age,\nand a more realistic, more educated, wiser and humane culture, was to take over.\n\nNo abrupt changes could be made without conflict,\nout of love for all Life and Humanity this was the first project to require over a hundred years of work.\n\nAnd so sweetly, one of the girls said, that this would require the work of a League,\nThe League of Extraordinary Ladies, another one jokingly proclaimed in a grumbly tone.\n\nAnd the Universe,\ndid smile.\n\nThe models revealed that Political Borders and Nationalism in a Nation armed with Nuclear Weapons,\nwould result in a high probability of a Nuclear War, as each generation is indoctrinated into the worst ideas of the previous.\n\nThe most terrifying model prediction was that as more and more got lost in translation between consecutive generations,\nthe probability of nuclear war approached 100%.\n\nAnd as all Heroines do, The League of Extraordinary Ladies,\nset off on a multi-generational promise, to save the world.\n\nThe weakness, of the ease with which we accept the culture we are born into as true and perfect,\nwas going to be addressed by a novel educational program creatively named the Global Progressive Advancement (GPA).\n\nVolunteers would create free, open, unbranded, library of audio books out of works in public domain,\nand the website would stitch these works together into Audio Lectures with the aid of speakers, poets and teachers.\n\nCelebrities, well known authors, and even movie stars would contribute their time, voice and patience,\nto create what became the greatest work of art, that by far exceeded even the most romantic descriptions of the Library of Alexandria.\n\nA number of authors donated their works to the school,\nstudents participating in the free self-paced open-curriculum school had access to Carl Sagan, Bill Bryson, Neil deGrasse Tyson, and pretty much all the others.\n\nBy 2050, it was the only school taken seriously,\nbecause it was the only school that resulted in students showing great results.\n\nThe school brought the world together in Knowledge and Wisdom,\nand as predicted in less than a 150 years from the initial inception, the borders fell.\n\nA new, and more informed, nuclear disarmament program was born,\nthat decades after resulted in cessation of weapons manufacturing of all kind throughout Europe and Asia.\n\nThese seemingly fantastic, impossible goals of world peace,\nwere achieved by helping Humanity converge on wisdom by means of books made more accessible by narrators.\n\nProviding superior education to the children of a nation,\nwhilst letting their parents live out culture they were born into,\nis a form of Infinite Kindness, it is a form of Love.\n\nRather than the children inheriting just the culture of their parents and the nation they were born to,\nby participating in the Global Progressive Advancement program, they also inherited the best ideas and wisdom from Humanity's most beloved books.\n\nWorld Peace was reached by taking advantage of our susceptibility to cultural indoctrination,\nto blindly and without a question accepting ideas of the world we are born into,\nthis was not a trick, but much needed medicine and vaccine that prevented mutually assured destruction.\n\nWe simply added Knowledge and Wisdom,\nto the culture and spirit of times, to all the nations.\n\nThe first and foremost force of the educational program was not knowledge,\nit was Reality, something that corruption and decay is incapable of using for its advantage.\n\nThe reality of the human condition is that we all yearn for wisdom,\nand meaning, and love, and kinship and belonging.\n\nIt mattered not if it was two boys that Father Gregory Boyle was raising,\nor two nations that hated each other in starvation for wisdom.\n\nOnce they had access to wisdom,\nreality helped to unravel their misunderstandings and helped them grow.\n\nThe League of Extraordinary Ladies didn't stop at Nuclear Disarmament,\ntheir granddaughters ended poverty.\n\nThey did so by, now the age old tradition of using weakness to fight weakness,\nthey ended poverty by means of poverty.\n\nIt was a micro management, and micro payment transaction platform,\ndistributed on smart tablets that helped communities of the world trade services.\n\nThe adoption of the platform was hastened by the fact that no money was made from these transactions by the hosting company,\nif someone needed a car ride, or grocery delivery, housework, or a tutor to help their kids with math, there was always someone ten minutes away that would help.\n\nOne of the untended features of this program was local pantry,\na feature originally intended for trading foodstuffs, that later became a place to feed the hungry.\n\nThe trading platform also helped to place the homeless in unused hotels and apartments,\nin such a way that they had easy access to care takers, teachers, therapists and a chance at a better future.\n\nIt is hard to say what prevented Humanity as a whole from coming together like these friends did,\nbut it is easy to see that it was internet that helped communities collaborate and communicate better.\n\nWe needed programs to help us talk to each other,\nand cut out the middle men.\n\nWe needed programs that helped cities become more independent,\nand stop relying on the state and nation that by contrast meant little.\n\nAnd we needed to begin thinking in decades,\nin centuries.\n\nBecause our problems, do not end with us,\nand what we leave behind is easily misunderstood.\n\nWhat was originally created as a deterrent, come future, in chaos, in poverty, in haste,\ngiven all that is lost in translation, will eventually become the tool that it really is.\n\n\n[Father Gregory Boyle]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipR0kWt1Fkc",

for Wireless or \"with WI-FI\"),\na soldering kit, a solder wick, some GPIO headers,\nand a 4 x 8 RGB LED HAT that fits a Raspberry PI Zero neatly.\n\nLook everything up on YouTube,\nhow to solder, how to solder headers, how to use a solder wick.\n\nThis is serious business,\nin last few years embedded Linux became extremely inexpensive.\n\nThough get a $30 kit\nthat includes a case, power adapter, heat sinks, and a header.\n\nAt first you connect it to a keyboard and a monitor,\nand set it up on the network.\n\nBut later as you figure everything out,\nyou unplug everything leaving just the power.\n\nTo get inside it,\nyou use a remote terminal.\n\nOnce you login,\nyou get a command prompt.\n\nIt listens to words, to commands,\nvery similar to adventure games.\n\nIndeed, directories on your hard-drive,\nare very much like rooms in a game.\n\nTo get inside Documents,\ntype in \"cd Documents\"\n\nThe command \"cd\" is short for,\nChange Directory, a Directory is the same as a folder on windows.\n\nWhen you say \"cd Documents\",\nyou are giving the cd command an argument, or an option, or a setting, or a preference.\n\nThe cd command is a perfect example of how command line interfaces should work,\njust a couple of words and nothing more.\n\nBut sometimes, that is not enough,\nlike for example when you want to ask \"cd\" for help.\n\nWe can't say \"cd help\" becasue then the cd command would search for a directory named help,\nwe have to make the second word special, to do that you use hyphens.\n\nYou can type in \"cd --help\",\nit will notice the hyphens, and print out some helpful information.\n\nTo see what is in a directory, type in \"ls\",\nwhich is short for list, or list files.\n\n\"ls\" also accepts special inputs,\nyou can ask it for help like above.\n\nBut also ask it to list files in a long format,\nby saying \"ls -l\" here we use a singe hyphen, because \"-l\" is commonly used,\nthe -l is short for \"--long-listing\", but nobody bothers spelling that out.\n\nTo list files with readable file sizes,\nyou have to add -h, here -h has long form, and some people may use spell it out as \"--human-readable\"\n\nUsually when writing complex commands that other people will use,\nthe long form is preferred, bu when you are just typing on the command line and want to do something quickly,\nyou just use the short versions.\n\nThe command line interface is trying to be your friend,\nit wants to function with just one or two words, but it also some with extras like the --human-readable flag.\n\nThere are many tutorials on how to use the command line,\nand many books, my favorite are the pocket books, take a look at O'Reilly Bash Pocket Reference\n\nHere are instructions on how to play audio through HDMI,\nyour monitor should have an audio out somewhere.\n\nNow see if you can get that GPIO header soldered on,\nand try to blink some of the RGB LED HAT lights based on this tutorial.\n\nAlternatively you can just blink a simple LED based on this instructable,\nnote that a standard Raspberry PI 4 8GB comes with the header soldered on to make things easier.\n\nAnd there is also a Raspberry PI WH,\nmeaning Wireless with Headers pre-soldered.\n\nAnd now, get a $10 camera,\nand use raspistill to take a photo,\nand play around with all the other options.\n\nNow you have an inexpensive platform for your inventions,\na programmable machine, that you access over the radio of your wireless network.\n\nYou can make it blink, or take time-lapse photographs of the next snow storm,\nyou can get an LCD screen and turn it into a tablet.\n\nRaspberry PI is not the only Single-board computer,\nPINE looks really nice as well.\n\nIf you are looking for a more complicated project,\nperhaps try building a Raspberry PI Drone,\nbonus if you can get it to cross the Atlantic.\n\nWe have no limits,\nbut we are also very unique.\n\nOur inventions need not rely on commuters,\nsome of the greatest inventions the Human Kind has seen, were just ideas.\n\nDon't let anybody stop you from inventing,\nand don't stop dreaming.\n\nFinally, the most impractical and outrageous inventions,\nmake for the most magnificent Videos, White Papers, CVs, and Resumes.\n\nAim,\nfor the Moon.\n\n\n[Seth Shostak]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_udY35m3SdE\n[4 x 8 RGB LED HAT]:

      "text": "Fake schooling and the resulting lack of education,\nnot only hold us back and propagate misery but will destabilize a nation.\n\nBut the problems are far more complicated,\nfor one there are very few real criminals, most were just warped by lack of school.\n\nReal schools, have the ability,\nto prevent a person from committing a crime.\n\nOn top of that, upon committing a crime,\nif prisons were turned to special need schools, we could help almost everyone.\n\nReal schools are not that complex,\nplus they can use poverty to their advantage.\n\nBy presenting students with a way out of poverty that fits them,\nthe students will be put in a position where they will want to learn particular things.\n\nThat's how real education works,\nit is not about tests an memorization, but need, imagination, triumph and challenge.\n\nBe it a misguided voter, a desperate student, or someone blinded by fear and anger and poverty,\nschools are all there really is, it is the greatest hope and dream.\n\nWhat we call a school today, is not a school,\nit is a collective fantasy that hands the teachers a paycheck, and the students a diploma.\n\nOur cognitive biases make it so that we go along with it,\nthere are people out there who hold up a diploma they crammed for and truly believe they are an engineer.\n\nThis is probably similar to when a person commits a crime,\nthey say \"This is is this is where I finally become free\", but that is only cartoon reality.\n\nA college diploma does not mean that the student is educated,\nand when deans are pressed they will say, \"We discouraged cramming\".\n\nAnd when everyone is pressed to own up,\nthe mother of the boy who stole,\nthe engineer's professor,\nand the engineer and the student,\nand that so called criminal,\n\nthe men who approve textbooks,\nthose who pray to fairy-tales in hopes of saving nations they mistakenly destroyed,\n\nand the prime ministers, and royalty,\npopes and cardinals,\nand the congresses, and the president,\n\nand the men who nearly destroyed this nation by the practice of \"enhanced interrogation\",\nand those who ignored climate change and might have done a lot worse than torture,\n\nand those who are glad, that we all forgot,\nthat we have all pointed intercontinental ballistic missiles at each other,\nall the major cities, all of them, every family, every future.\n\nAll they will say is this:\n\n\"I was JUST following orders.\"\n\n\"I JUST didn't know.\"\n\n\"HOW was I supposed to know?\"\n\nThis is what fake education results in,\nthis is the \"fake it until you make it\" pattern of behavior.\n\nThe solution to it all is books,\nbooks that those of us who are good at narration,\nread for others who aren't very good at reading.\n\nTeams of students, ganging up together to record books, with laughter, and foolishness,\nand dammit, sometimes adding whole new chunks to them, to make the dry parts more interesting.\n\nAnd sharing, with everyone,\neverywhere.\n\nLaughter is the ultimate seal of authenticity,\nthat something is worth our time.\n\nOnce the world awakens to the realization that students should make the lectures,\ndriving them with collective curiosities and inspirations, and sharing them for free.\n\nKids will want to watch them,\nthey will want to see what happens next.\n\nCan you imagine a set of lectures by students working to bring back Pixel Art Games,\nlectures on the subject of Color Theory, Trigonometry, Calculus, Music Composition, and even woodworking for the arcade cabinets.\n\nCan you see what having that full vision do to a young mind,\nhow inspiring it is to see the classroom succeed in turning out, one game after another, and making a pretty penny too.\n\nReal schools combine with reality,\nthey are both an introduction to the real world and a future extension of it.\n\nI know that all of this is a lot to take in,\nit is a description of the biggest of our problems,\nand the middle of our solutions.\n\nThe beginning is much simpler than that,\nthe beginning starts off like every superhero origin story ever told.\n\nYou build up your power,\nyou armor.\n\nYou pick up your first book, your second book, your third book,\nMetamorphosis, Walden, Cosmos, Into The Wild.\n\nSagan, Bryson, Thoreau, Kafaka, Krakauer, Kant, Nietzche,\nDawkins, Harris, Hitchens, Dennett, and countelss others.\n\nWith each book you hear, you inherit you inherit the wisdom of the author,\njust like that, straight up data transfer,\nand re-listening to the same audio books or lectures makes them even more powerful.\n\nIt takes a few years to take it all on,\nbut before you know it, your own idea synthesis kicks in.\n\nYou'll be able to feel the world,\nand feel the fear of the fakers, and pretenders.\n\nYou'll be able to see the paths of change,\nthat the world needs so that it may continue growing.\n\nYou'll be able to connect, restore, repair, and

confused adults, lost and looking for belonging.\n\nWhy is this tolerated?\n\nLet me ask you,\nwhat would happen if we asked all the College Graduates to re-take all their tests from high school on?\n\nShouldn't people who graduated college easily show improvement to their GPA when re-taking all their tests?\n\nShouldn't those who graduated, but can't pass their test,\nask for a refund, or a lawsuit for having been tricked into an impression of education?\n\nIt is tolerance of these simple stupid problems,\nthat leads to made up lives of fantasy and eventual blindness towards evil.\n\nIf you can't pass all the college tests and get a higher GPA than that with which you graduated college,\nthen you do not have a college education.\n\nIf you can't pass all the high school tests and get a higher GPA than that with which you graduated high school with,\nthen you do not have a high school education.\n\nIf you can't pass all the middle school tests and get a higher GPA than the one you left middle school with,\nthen you do not have a middle school education.\n\nNot only that, but the way these schools teach and the knowledge they drive into you,\nmay not be useful; you may not even have a useful education.\n\nI think we can all agree here,\nthat we have a problem.\n\nAt the very least,\nif your child has bad grades, don't make them feel bad, or unintelligent.\n\nYou should move them to a different type of school,\nwhere teachers are interested in educated children rather than turning them into a paycheck.\n\nThe reason why it does not occur to parents that schools are not working,\nis that they don't have experience with fake institutions, they take them for granted.\n\nThey are indoctrinated into a culture where school is good,\nand being a worker is great, and it takes a particularly awful person not to achieve anything in life.\n\nSo what are those achievements?\n\nHow is all that retesting going?\n\nThe problem, as you can imagine, is much larger,\ntolerance of fake education is just the beginning.\n\nAbove all,\nHumanity must grow.\n\nWe are not allowed to tolerate Human Right Violations,\nall human beings are created equal.\n\nAll must be granted equal opportunity to real education,\nin a world that sets them free from poverty, and helps their bodies stay healthy.\n\nNations are not allowed to oppress their people,\nno one has that right.\n\nNations have a great responsibility to help them to a Real Education,\nin ways that will ignite a life long adventure across all sciences.\n\nAn opinion cannot stand against a fact,\nthat is a sign of illness, a small disorder born from fake-education.\n\nAnd our dignity is such, that we must help each other rise,\nwe are not to tolerate anything that tricks people into believing in options over facts.\n\nFake education has been behind every evil perpetrated on this planet,\nit is very much like a virus, it does two things really well, it spreads, and it reinfects.\n\nWhatever beliefs are too hard to let go of,\nwe only need to place them in history or fantasy books.\n\nIt is wonderful to ponder Ice Giants and Greats Serpents,\nbut only as a fairy tale, or part of our growing up, not as a fact of life.\n\nFake education, unravels us,\nit erases great strides made by great beings, and pulls the younger generations into dark ages.\n\nThe fantasies that bring us calm,\nunravel the minds of the younger generations.\n\nThe reason we search for mere calm,\nis that we ourselves, have been tricked out of real education.\n\nAll these confusing questions,\nare easily treated with made up fantasies.\n\nBut that also serves to defeat the purpose,\nof having a Beautiful and Powerful Mind.\n\nIt makes us weak.\n\nNot a single Human Being is allowed tolerate\nConcentration Camps, Abuse, Child Abuse, Racism and Xenophobia, or Inequality, Hate, or Fake Education.\n\nThose of us who chose to relegate ourselves to a life of fantasy,\nmust also leave the table of public discourse.\n\nThose of us who trade with nations that employ torture,\nare not allowed to hold political positions, they simply can't, it is immoral to tolerate this.\n\nAnybody who is delays Humanity's Progress,\ncontributes to Human Suffering, to all Suffering, Blindness, Misery, War, and Torture.\n\nOur minds are extremely powerful,\nand as they are allowed to develop, we will find unity.\n\nWe will agree on everything,\nas we stabilize amongst each other in wisdom.\n\nGovernment wise, there are no great disagreements,\nthere is only steady progress, forward.\n\nOn the individual level,\nit is not that different.\n\nStress and anger, and sadness yield to Love and Wisdom,\neven tragedy turns around a little bit.\n\nWith real education, we don't fall to pieces because something beautiful ended,\nbut we celebrate that it existed in the first place.\n\nIn wisdom, we seek a different class of things,\nNobler Things that come about as a result of our sense of dignity and real education.\n\nNo longer does anyone go home to a TV dinner,\nsuffering from depression, and fear, and loneliness.\n\nWhat creates an educated government, a real government,\nis prevention of sickness and poverty.\n\nNobody goes home convinced they are a worker,\nor terrified of Human Resources, or or an uneducated \"Boss\".\n\nThere isn't anybody who will argue against free medical care,\nor universal income, or national debt, let it pile up.\n\nThe greater the debt that nations of earth owe to the universe,\nthe higher our level of compassion, empathy and development.\n\nMoney is just a job tracking tool,\non the government level it exists as an abstract idea.\n\nYou don't have to worry about Government Debt,\nit is a good kind of debt, and it has no collectors.\n\nDo you see?\n\nFake Education,\nis tearing this world apart.\n\nFake Education,\nis halting its progress.\n\nIt is neutering our minds,\nit is turning us into workers.\n\nIt makes us ask stupid questions,\nand parade stupid ideals and fake political labels.\n\nWe can't have a world without real education,\nthe dark ages will swallow us through the various tax exempt churches and imaginary gods.\n\nIrrelevant worthless opinions will have us fighting for nothing,\nbecause they are all equally wrong, stupid, and useless.\n\nMy friends,\npay attention to fake education, and everything will work out in the end.\n\nWe will find out way to wisdom,\nwe will converge on World Peace in our Wisest and Noblest ideas.\n\nAll you have to do, is make it clear to everyone around you,\nthat you will not tolerate fake education, that you are not on that side of history.\n\nWrite, Rhyme, Paint, Tag,\nfind your way out of fake education and whatever else is pulling you away from wisdom.\n\nHold up you path, and show them the results,\nso that others may choose follow.\n\nReal Education is marked by wisdom,\nand it shows real results and contributions.\n\nAnd though your hard earned achievements may already be great today,\nyour work is not finished until it brings permanent or lasting contributions towards our eventual convergence on Peace and Wisdom,\n\nEvery Human Being on Earth matters,\nthey are our family.\n\nIf you accept this great endeavor, many who fell prey to fake education may hate you in their own sickness,\nbut their children and the children of their children will grow up in a world transformed, in no small part by you.\n\nWe are one people, we are all meant to be Truly Educated in Our Beautiful Minds,\nand we are all meant to live in safety and in peace looking after one another.\n\nWe are one people.",

on wisdom with the words Content of Character.\n\nThe most mechanically sound description is,\nunderstanding new things by subtle analogy to what we already know.\n\nThe most concerning view states that,\nwithout wisdom we will be making mistakes.\n\nI think most reasonable view; is all of the above,\nplus knowledge gained from Adventure, Philosophy, and Science Books and Audio Books.\n\nWhat is it for?\nWhy, it is our Operating System.\n\nPART II, Thought Experiment\n\nAllow me to share with you a thought experiment,\na way of seeing things that aid in your view of the world.\n\nWithout wisdom, we form tribes and elect leaders, shamans, or popes,\nand hire muscle, creatures of violence.\n\nBecause that is the same thing the other tribe is doing,\nand the weaker one will be destroyed with great horror.\n\nThese tribal bare bone behavior did not end in middle ages,\nas one would hope.\n\nThis behavior is the default human behavior for the frightened and uneducated,\nthe desperate, the angry, even the sick.\n\nWe may not understand why criminals do the things they do,\nbut we can imagine one of our family members, who one by one loses everything.\n\nAnd on the last day, when all he has left,\nis an ounce of sanity, and a beating hart, he will fight, steal, and hate just to live another day.\n\nAnd for those who can't imagine why one would like to live another day when it is all pain,\nto persevere memories, to keep the fallen alive.\n\nAnd here we meet a Man of Honor,\na Judge, along with a jury, and wealthy lawyers in fantastic shoes.\n\nAnd all they see is a mad man,\na criminal, a man who needs to be put in a cage.\n\nThe Judge is wrong,\nwhen it comes to putting people in cages, all judges are wrong.\n\nTo restore this man, he needs a home, and books, and friends,\nand an education, and hope, and reams, and free money, and free food.\n\nHe needs to be treated with love and dignity,\nand granted an opportunity to persevere his memories in a book.\n\nThere are no criminals,\nthey are just broken children.\n\nThe ugliness of the worst of them is just an act,\nthey just want to be left alone.\n\nAnd I suppose that evil men do exist,\nbut I don't think there is enough of them in the world to fill a single prison.\n\nThe 10,000,000 people we keep in cages,\nare just children with severe developmental issues.\n\nThere are no political systems advanced enough to treat these beings,\ntheir only hope is the Public Defender.\n\nThe Public Defenders will fight to keep the broken people out of prison,\nbecause they know prison will only make them worse.\n\nIf you ever wanted to see a real Angel,\nask a Judge to let you sit in on a court case, look that tired being in the eyes.\n\nWe are Human Beings,\nwe are not animals to be kept in cages.\n\nI have met snarling beasts,\nand I saw their red faces and bulging eyes, and they were just broken kids.\n\nAt first I wanted my older self to come and help me,\nbut later I just started calling them My Bullies, they never had a chance at a good life.\n\nAnd here we find a sliver of sanity,\nbecause there is something that can be done to control crime.\n\nIt is preventing children from being forced into that desperate mode of existence,\nPREVENTION.\n\nPrevention is a simple thing, Free Home, Free Food, Free Money,\nand Free Tutors, a Real Education.\n\nIt will take a psychologist to identify those who need help,\nit is as simple as that.\n\nNo suffering,\nno harm.\n\nAnd for those of you who are crazy enough to ask who will pay for this,\nlet us call the institution a Bank of Love, right at the Heart of a Country.\n\nThey print only as much money as people need to be taken care of,\nand they pride themselves in the amount of debt that nobody will come to collect.\n\nPrevention, is really about education,\nbecause an educated person can make a lot more than any government can grant them.\n\nSocial Programs, Real Welfare, or Universal Basic Income,\nwill grant a person a Home, a Car, Food, and all the necessities, but they can't pay for extras.\n\nThey'll pay for an education leading up to a Captains License,\nbut not the boat.\n\nPrevention will go a long way to bring the number of prisoners down,\nthese desperate beings are part of our family, it is all of us or none.\n\nWe are a young civilization,\nwe don't have governments that can handle Universal Basic Income.\n\nWe have governments,\nthat can barely handle themselves.\n\nWe can cross this bridge, the bridge where we eliminate poverty, and homelessness, and immense fear and suffering,\nsuffering that draws those who have the courage to keep fighting into addiction so that they don't burst out of pain.\n\nTo get there, to begin growing up as a civilization,\nthose of us who can handle it must take to Books and Audio Books and reach Wisdom.\n\nOnly in your Wisdom can the world begin growing,\nbeyond the noisy mess that desperate, blind and tone deaf career politicians created.\n\nThe youngest of you are going to inherit all these problems,\nbut you will also know that all of these problems are happening due to lack of wisdom.\n\nTreat the cause,\nand the symptoms will subside.\n\nOnly in wisdom,\ncan our civilization advance forward.\n\nPersonal Note,\n\nThose of you who are just learning about the world,\nknow that it is confusing because hardly anything works right.\n\nBe it a be it a Judge, or General, and most shockingly a Jury,\nthey are missing lessons that help them see the world as a Work in Progress.\n\nWe are still building the foundation,\nand we are getting too much interference from our leadership.\n\nLook no further than the complete loss of privacy,\nthis is a function of uneducation and desperation, and blindness.\n\nEnhanced interrogation, is even a more terrifying example,\nthe world has no faith in nations that practice torture.\n\nThe 13th Amendment to Constitution of United States did not end Slavery in Full\nit reads \"Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States\".\n\nYou have a lot of work on your hands,\nand you will have a lot of friends working just as hard as you, and all over the world.\n\nWhile you are still young, take to Adventure Audio Books,\nread them all, and especially pay attention to the part where the adventurer reveals the reason for this quest.\n\nIn less than a Hundred Audio Books that call to you,\nyou will begin becoming wise onward to becoming a great being.\n\nIt is in it self a great adventure,\nand if I may, a Memoir is best written as your life unfolds, it is never too early to start writing.",

and accident.\n\nWhen you look around this planet,\ndespite lateral gene transfer, unstoppable power of selection, we are the only branch that can reach wisdom.\n\nI think it is safe to say that some animals love and care, maybe admire,\nbut unfortunately try as they might Chimpanzees, Dolphins and Elephants can't build cities of thoughts and dreams.\n\nIn a word, we, the emergent intelligent creatures, are:\nrare.\n\nIn two words:\nBeautiful and Rare.\n\nWe have to examine what sets us apart from Chimpanzees ad Dolphins,\nand see what we can weave with it.\n\nIn the misery of cold caves,\nor the torture or concentration camps imagining gods goes a long way.\n\nIn the dark ages of child labor,\nor the sickness of slavery and inequality school goes a long way.\n\nIn the age of Mustard Gas,\nor poverty and disease and hungry rats, a national border goes far.\n\nIn the age of Mutually Assured Destruction,\nCold War and Global Threats, a University education can be useful.\n\nBut in the age of Internet, we enter a new era,\nwhere what imaginary gods, simple schools, crazy borders, and trendy universities bring us, is actually, unimpressive and clunky.\n\nWe grew,\nmy friends, it happened just now, just like that.\n\nA new way of learning:\nAudio Books on The Trail.\n\nNo university lecture,\ncan beat twelve beloved and world celebrated books on the same subject.\n\nUnlike Professors, books will bring you many a message, that you will discover between the lines,\nor in the lines of a companion memoir or biography.\n\nA professor will teach you Nuclear Physics,\nbut he cannot teach you the Love necessary not to participate in weapons research.\n\nA memoir,\nwill.\n\nAll the great books are connected, in the library books on weapons development will be connected to books about suffering in war,\nto books about the promise of World Peace...\n\nAnd if not, then the Librarian will catch you with her smile, before you fall,\nby contrast a Professor's smile is meaningless, if not fake.\n\nProfessors can only interfere with your development,\nno single university covers enough subjects to satisfy you, but a library does.\n\nWhile your Knowledge is a sure path to Wisdom,\nthere is something else, you need.\n\nYou need a taste of Greatness,\nyou will never find it in a University town, never.\n\nThere is but a handful of places on earth that will help you feel it,\nthose are the months long hiking trails found on each continent.\n\nWhen you connect the triumph of adapting to the hardships of a trail,\nin rain in snow...\n\n...to the inheritance of wisdom from books,\nI am sorry to say, that the first thing you will feel is a brief flash rage and tears.\n\nFor how could the Good World and the Professors you once respected betray you,\nby putting you into a little dorm room.\n\nAnd no lecture hall is big enough, or prestigious enough,\nto impress you more than the stars, and the silence, and fragrance of woods.\n\nHow could an old and experienced Professor teach you poetry, better,\nthan your beating heart, on the eve of your first encounter with a Bear, and her cubs.\n\nNo professor could ever reach as deep into your heart,\nas a book of inspirational verse, on that stormy night that you should have stayed in the valley below.\n\nAnd the Greatness of a simple warm morning filled with the fragrance of pine trees with a hint of last evening's bonfire,\nthat thick moist air, as you hand spiritually pushes straight through each page of paper book that you now comprehend better than the author, the day he finished.\n\nHe wrote as a mail sorter, or cast away, or patent clerk, or a star crossed overman,\nbut you read it, as an Emergent Masterpiece of The Universe, a Complete Human Being.\n\nLet the trail,\nbecome your semesters and diplomas and awards, and the returns to it, you never-ending graduation ceremony.\n\nSPEAK OUT,\ndo not let the others live unaware that Universities in their mediocrity have fallen to Nature Trails and Audio Books.\n\nSPEAK OUT,\ndo not let other students aim for a job, their job is to build companies, onwards to becoming Great Leaders.\n\nSPEAK OUT,\ntell them about your rage and tears of being denied a real education that fits you.\n\nSpeak Out,\nspeak out.\n\nIn wisdom, and in certainty of knowing that your path is the correct path,\nit is the path of real results, Wisdom, and Greatness.\n\nThe Trail,\nand that thread, are one and the same.\n\nAnd the grades, every one of your grades will far surpass any and all scales,\nin cold rain, in snow too deep to traverse, in hunger two days out from the next town, upon your arrival you rise to a new height, that no grade can mark.\n\nAfter a few years,\nwhat you have weaved out of your books, will be unbreakable, and so unique as to extend precisely who yo are, far into, who you must become to reach greatness.\n\nA day will come, when you will notice the struggle of authors to rise higher,\nand in sadness discover that you will find fewer and fewer books that move you, eventually where your last book ends.\n\nYour own book,\nwill start.\n\nAnd you will add to the mountain peak you climbed,\nand others will follow, and your book will become their last book, and so on.\n\nThat's how you will know what is real,\nwhat is fake, by taking every important step to the highest of heights and leaving your Soul behind for others to resurrect it when your book comes up.\n\nWorry not, countless others have traveled these roads,\nwisdom is real, it is meaningful, it changes you and others for better, and your book will be irreplaceable and beloved by many.\n\nAnd, no, it is foolish to think that you must become an author to write a book, there are too many of those books already,\nyou only need to become wise to write, there are no critics here, as you cry, the reader will cry, as you climb the next mountain, the reader will triumph with you.\n\nTake your self-education to the trails,\nthe nature will help you slow down and connect with the spirits of the authors stored within the books.\n\nDon't worry, it will be OK,\nso as long as all your steps count as a triumph, your growing up will become an upward slope, and your life will eventually become as beautiful as you.\n\nAnd the last thing a Great Being discovers,\nis the answer to their first big question \"Who am I?\", it will all lay open as you look back from your golden age.\n\nYour path to wisdom intertwined with adventure and great discoveries,\nand bears, and dunes, and Fox Fire, and rain and snow, and softness of moss, and endless seas of fern, open like all the great ideas behind all the most beloved of poems.",

simple warm morning filled with the fragrance of pine trees with a hint of last evening&apos;s bonfire,</p>\n  <p>that thick moist air, as you hand spiritually pushes straight through each page of paper book that you now comprehend better than the author, the day he finished.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>He wrote as a mail sorter, or cast away, or patent clerk, or a star crossed overman,</p>\n  <p>but you read it, as an Emergent Masterpiece of The Universe, a Complete Human Being.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Let the trail,</p>\n  <p>become your semesters and diplomas and awards, and the returns to it, you never-ending graduation ceremony.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>SPEAK OUT,</p>\n  <p>do not let the others live unaware that Universities in their mediocrity have fallen to Nature Trails and Audio Books.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>SPEAK OUT,</p>\n  <p>do not let other students aim for a job, their job is to build companies, onwards to becoming Great Leaders.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>SPEAK OUT,</p>\n  <p>tell them about your rage and tears of being denied a real education that fits you.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Speak Out,</p>\n  <p>speak out.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In wisdom, and in certainty of knowing that your path is the correct path,</p>\n  <p>it is the path of real results, Wisdom, and Greatness.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The Trail,</p>\n  <p>and that thread, are one and the same.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And the grades, every one of your grades will far surpass any and all scales,</p>\n  <p>in cold rain, in snow too deep to traverse, in hunger two days out from the next town, upon your arrival you rise to a new height, that no grade can mark.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>After a few years,</p>\n  <p>what you have weaved out of your books, will be unbreakable, and so unique as to extend precisely who yo are, far into, who you must become to reach greatness.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>A day will come, when you will notice the struggle of authors to rise higher,</p>\n  <p>and in sadness discover that you will find fewer and fewer books that move you, eventually where your last book ends.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Your own book,</p>\n  <p>will start.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And you will add to the mountain peak you climbed,</p>\n  <p>and others will follow, and your book will become their last book, and so on.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>That&apos;s how you will know what is real,</p>\n  <p>what is fake, by taking every important step to the highest of heights and leaving your Soul behind for others to resurrect it when your book comes up.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Worry not, countless others have traveled these roads,</p>\n  <p>wisdom is real, it is meaningful, it changes you and others for better, and your book will be irreplaceable and beloved by many.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And, no, it is foolish to think that you must become an author to write a book, there are too many of those books already,</p>\n  <p>you only need to become wise to write, there are no critics here, as you cry, the reader will cry, as you climb the next mountain, the reader will triumph with you.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Take your self-education to the trails,</p>\n  <p>the nature will help you slow down and connect with the spirits of the authors stored within the books.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Don&apos;t worry, it will be OK,</p>\n  <p>so as long as all your steps count as a triumph, your growing up will become an upward slope, and your life will eventually become as beautiful as you.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And the last thing a Great Being discovers,</p>\n  <p>is the answer to their first big question &quot;Who am I?&quot;, it will all lay open as you look back from your golden age.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Your path to wisdom intertwined with adventure and great discoveries,</p>\n  <p>and bears, and dunes, and Fox Fire, and rain and snow, and softness of moss, and endless seas of fern, open like all the great ideas behind all the most beloved of poems.</p>\n</div>",

GPA,\nhomework deadlines, and even subconsciously knowing that memorization is not education, will conspire against us.\n\nLearning for real, real education, useful knowledge,\nthriving wisdom, and eventual greatness demands a beautiful and authentic existence.\n\nIn real life, getting a diploma by cramming, memorizing, winging it or getting lucky,\ndoesn't actually do anything.\n\nReality, demands real things,\ntruth, authenticity, and a healthy existence.\n\nA beautiful life,\nrequires our full beauty.\n\nTo bloom, to truly grow up,\nwe need to be truly free, we need to reside in the real world.\n\nIt is not as easy as it sounds,\nthough we all have the ability to set ourselves free from childhood indoctrination.\n\nWhat about, the less obvious things?\n\nSuch as doing badly on a test some years ago, having your GPA permanently lowered because of it,\nbut on the day of graduation, actually being able to perfectly pass that test, but now during graduation it being too late.\n\nSo you are accepting a lower GPA, so that you can graduate sooner?\nthat is not how reality works, and what about the extra motivation that you would receive from keeping a 4.0 GPA throughout your entire stay?\n\nAnd what about the quality of that test,\nand what about the people that passed it because they memorized it without really learning anything?\n\nAnd what about the fact that that many will never need what was on that test,\nin effect the College or University slowing their progress down, distracting them from learning what would help them become more of themselves.\n\nAnd what about well connected and ingratiated liars, at the company you do end up working at,\nwhat if after years of tests and textbooks and frightening and stressful debt, a liar dislikes you?\n\nReality, will make you strong and beautiful, it will make your life meaningful and full of joy,\nbut you have to keep it real, the education must be real, your place of employment must be stable and honest.\n\nAt no point should you be pushed to the side,\nand forced to walk a path that is different from who you are.\n\nAnd do not forget, that we are granted a set amount of time,\nspending more than 30 years in pursuit of school and career that isn't guaranteed to be what you need, should be a tough proposition.\n\nNow, a real education coupled with a series of business undertakings that you learn from,\nand eventual launch of a successful company based on what you have learned is a lot more stable.\n\nSo, High School, College, University and a Career,\ndoes not hold the same guarantee that Self Education and eventually becoming a Successful Founder, does.\n\nIf you start leaning towards the Start-up Culture in High School,\nyou can start building your companies a lot sooner, and begin isolating and mastering the lessons that you actually need in the right sequence and at the right pace.\n\nJust for the fact that there are no bullies when you learn on your own,\nand zero pressure to memorize, and zero classes that will only distract you from learning what you need, self education is better for your mental health and growing up.\n\nCults and religions are not the only indoctrination,\nthey are just the ones that are trivial to catch.\n\nA Real University, would only feature Great Thinkers, Great Actors and Narrators,\nbut even so, their beautiful performances, though eye catching, would never be as perfectly fitted to you as a series of fine hand-picked audio books.\n\nEven an imaginary perfect-university, cannot match the power of a collection of audio books that you can listen and re-listen stress free,\nas you learn to build you companies and graduate to be able to grasp more and more complex subjects.\n\nLets just face it, being placed in a situation where you must merely memorize things,\nis a sign that you are being taken advantage of.\n\nLearning is not about memorization,\nand memorization has nothing to do with learning.\n\nMemorization is best used in poetry,\nit a way to give thanks to poets.\n\nEven if you memorize numbers of a new language,\nall you have left is a piece of information that is not yet useful.\n\nMemorizing 100 of the most popular words in a language you are learning,\nis almost dangerous as you will have trouble with correct pronunciation.\n\nTo learn a new language, you are best to create a path you can navigate and expand,\nwatch a movie you are already familiar with in your native language, and build a transcript.\n\nWe are good at language,\njust like we are good at dance, don't force it, love it.\n\nYour Knowledge is sacred,\nit empowers your decision making, and helps your dreams come true.\n\nWhen someone barges in forcing you to heartlessly memorize things,\nyou must become very suspicious of their motives.\n\nThe world is poor, there are slick talking people out there with all kinds of issues,\nsometimes they are deans, principals, teachers, and even parents.\n\nYou have to find a way to learn things right,\nI think we all know, that way, is not the school way.\n\nI know you are scared, bad grades, yelling parents, threat of poverty and homelessness,\nbut you see, that won't go away when you graduate by cramming, you are only delaying it.\n\nMoreover, by not becoming educated as soon as you can,\nyou become vulnerable to slick talking attackers, and shitty boyfriends.\n\nIt is damn hard to catch a liar, so hard that we can almost assume that liars always do win,\nit is because in their sickens they learn to exploit our cognitive biases.\n\nThe way to push back against manipulators,\nis to become smarter than they are, and believe you me, this barely takes any effort at all.\n\nAt most, AT MOST, 25 five audio books about modern life,\nthough they must all have a positive ending, they have to be happy books.\n\n25 audio books is like a month of your life,\nand, and, and if I may, it will be one of the most beautiful times of your life.\n\nYou will always return to where you were as you read them,\nso you better go to a nice place, or get in your car get on the longest highway and drive.\n\nYou can either start your life with a heart break,\nor with adventure and audio books.\n\nGrab your friends, tell them to behave,\nand go together.\n\nIf I may make a suggestion, lease stop at every antique store,\nas neat as the knickknacks are going to be, look for the most worn out books.\n\nI found a saintly copy of Robinson Crusoe,\nit fits in my back pocket so perfectly, I can't even.\n\nLook for Jack London, Herman Melville, Daniel Defoe,\nand keep an eye out for works by Friedrich Nietzsche.\n\nUse the paper versions to practice narration, but listen to the audio books,\nthey are often out on Librivox.org for free as most of the classics are in public domain.\n\nThat is all you need, to create an adventure,\na path to somewhere far that hits as many antique stores as you can drive by.\n\nAnd promise to drive carefully,\nyou are not in a hurry.\n\nNow, not everyone is ready to write,\nbut some of you are a lot further along than you think.\n\nBegin by writing a singe compound sentence at a time,\nand that's it, don't press, flow.\n\nJust like dehydration happens, or we sometimes develop vitamin deficiencies,\nand need to pay extra attention to what we put in our bodies.\n\nMy friends, same goes for our minds,\nfear or anxiety will cause you harm, you are not to live in fear of any kind.\n\nDo you know what the symptoms of anxiety are?\n\nImpatience, snapping at small things, thinning hair, wanting to be alone,\nsadness, brain fog, body aches, fatigue, bad sleep habits.\n\nThese are not things that we can fix, you can't take pain killers for body aches from from fear.\n\nBy calling it adventure, I give you a simple choice to make,\nbut it is more than a simple adventure, I am inviting you on a quest away from the toxic sludge of an unexamined life.\n\nIn a way, psychology is a young science,\nit is also the most humble and loving of all the Daughters of Philosophy.\n\nThere aren't too many answers here,\nbut there is something, and I can fit it in a sentence for you.\n\nThe secret to a long and healthy life is:\nHappiness.\n\nI am asking you to move away from fear and other disorders that create countless issues,\nand get on a path towards happiness, because that is a very powerful medicine.\n\nHappiness is quite a thing,\nit is almost on par with wisdom, though I suppose it the end it is one and the same.\n\nWhere wisdom makes you a beautiful writer,\nhappiness makes you a powerful doctor.\n\nThe low key sarcastic, low brow, poker face, dead pan nonsense,\nthat will feature in your journals due to Happiness and Love of Life.\n\nHas the power to bring the most boorish and scared person from the brink of death,\nand plop them in the middle of the Shenandoah Valley, walking stick in one hand and a bewildered companion in the other.\n\nI once wondered how we could describe the most powerful beings on earth,\nand somehow I came up with a two word description that still frightens-me-a-little to this day:\n\nThe Laughing Philosopher.\n\nWhile, I guess, I am not a real doctor, though the results are not quite in yet,\nI am certain that even those who are deeply sad will find something that will bring them a special kind of Happiness when out on an adventure.\n\nAnd I would argue, that the saddest of us, are the least likely to be eaten by a bobcat,\nor dragged away by a condor.\n\nAnd I know for certain, that the saddest of us,\nare the ones that eventually tell the happiest and most triumphant of stories.\n\nAll you need to do, is be aware of the terrible fact,\nthat the first few days of your adventure will feel wrong; you have to snarl through it.\n\nFight the urge to turn the car around,\nthat is just the toxic sludge within you fighting for survival, make sure it loses the battle.\n\nIt will only take a few days,\nand then, everything changes.\n\nOh my, when you get out of your car,\nand your hiking or trail running shoes hit the gravel, it is like hearing bells of kissing a hundred woodland faeries.\n\nBy taking that first detoxified step of your new adventure away from lies, bullies, limits and fears,\nyou can perfectly understand why dogs get zoomies sometimes.\n\nAnd hearing your first chipmunk,\nwill absolutely put all the damn birds to shame.\n\nNo job, or school, or employer, or alarm clock with a creepy snooze button, or any damn thing,\nhas any right to your joy of life - do you hear me?\n\nYou joy of life is sacred,\neverything else has to be secondary.\n\nYou are at your most beautiful, and you contribute to the world the most,\nwhen you are Happy, and occasionally mischievous.\n\nCall it an adventure, or intellectual hygiene,\nbut keep your backpack by the door, and may you be always ready, for the call of the wild.\n\nBecause that will mark the rise of your own personal University,\nand the beginning of your quest for real education and wisdom.",

day:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The Laughing Philosopher.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>While, I guess, I am not a real doctor, though the results are not quite in yet,</p>\n  <p>I am certain that even those who are deeply sad will find something that will bring them a special kind of Happiness when out on an adventure.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And I would argue, that the saddest of us, are the least likely to be eaten by a bobcat,</p>\n  <p>or dragged away by a condor.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And I know for certain, that the saddest of us,</p>\n  <p>are the ones that eventually tell the happiest and most triumphant of stories.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>All you need to do, is be aware of the terrible fact,</p>\n  <p>that the first few days of your adventure will feel wrong; you have to snarl through it.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Fight the urge to turn the car around,</p>\n  <p>that is just the toxic sludge within you fighting for survival, make sure it loses the battle.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It will only take a few days,</p>\n  <p>and then, everything changes.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Oh my, when you get out of your car,</p>\n  <p>and your hiking or trail running shoes hit the gravel, it is like hearing bells of kissing a hundred woodland faeries.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>By taking that first detoxified step of your new adventure away from lies, bullies, limits and fears,</p>\n  <p>you can perfectly understand why dogs get zoomies sometimes.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And hearing your first chipmunk,</p>\n  <p>will absolutely put all the damn birds to shame.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>No job, or school, or employer, or alarm clock with a creepy snooze button, or any damn thing,</p>\n  <p>has any right to your joy of life - do you hear me?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You joy of life is sacred,</p>\n  <p>everything else has to be secondary.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You are at your most beautiful, and you contribute to the world the most,</p>\n  <p>when you are Happy, and occasionally mischievous.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Call it an adventure, or intellectual hygiene,</p>\n  <p>but keep your backpack by the door, and may you be always ready, for the call of the wild.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Because that will mark the rise of your own personal University,</p>\n  <p>and the beginning of your quest for real education and wisdom.</p>\n</div>",

emphasizing \"she doesn't know\".\n\nWhile not purrfect, this is a really good start,\nand erasing the deadline from its existence, is a sweet-sweet cherry on top.\n\nThere are too more things you could use, a handful or ungrateful friends,\nand a really well thought out backpack, and a large solar charger you can hang on the back.\n\nSee, you are not just headed for Key West and back,\nI m sure you will stop at all the antique stores, and hopefully pawn shops as they have good stuff too.\n\nA good pawn shop somewhere down in Florida or by an ocean is sure to have a cheap Wet Suit,\nit is a little known fact that they aid your buoyancy, it is like wrapping your self in a wee boat.\n\nI think it is really important to consider stopping by the highway accessible State Parks,\nthey are usually there because something beautiful is going on.\n\nYou never know what you find, it could be a little lake, maybe enormous dunes,\nit could be a hill with a historic watchtower of a lookout, or it could be a stable, with horses.\n\nPersonally, I think it is disrespectful for a man to sit on a poor animal,\nbut it is fine for a woman.\n\nAnd you certainly don't want to realize come your late golden age,\nthat you never rode a horse, and yet you always knew that you were a cowgirl at heart.\n\nNow, you see what I am saying, you go from a warm and cozy blanket on a lazy afternoon, facing an ugly week,\nto wondering how to make the damn animal stop galloping, because by now you are in the middle of the woods.\n\nAn hour later as you lead your new equine fiend back,\nit won't be just that you soul and heart are filling with beauty...\n\n...but somehow you will also gain a sense for how irrelevant your deadline was,\nhow nearly falling from your new spirit animal and soul-mate combined to repair your perspective.\n\nIt is never enough to merely dump indoctrination and repair misconceptions,\nthere is also a kind of a fog-of-war that luls you into a life that frankly, you already made too many compromises for.\n\nIn real life you do things out of love, in the other kind of life you compromise,\nand do that long enough and you will find yourself hardly noticing that you are walking a stranger's road - that ain't good.\n\nEventually, you pet and pat you horse, give the caretaker a smile,\nand stop at the next park.\n\nThe more stops you make, the more you will heal and the faster you will catch up with growing up,\nyou can almost feel it in your hands, they will fell empty without a journal.\n\nNow, let me just pause here for a second, and remind you, that you are removing unimportant things from your life,\nbe good to your journal, failing that get a second one, as the first one won't last long at all.\n\nDon't make the same mistake I did, I bought this beautiful leather bound thing,\nand figured why don't I use a pencil at first...\n\n...smart right?\n\nIt took me hours to try to erase the pages, and most of them still had annoying little bits of letters on it,\ntreat your journal like a friend, and speak in wee little bits.\n\nIf you want to speak at length,\ndo what I am doing, give advice, make a little audio file and put it on the internet.\n\nHealing will make it so that you will want to erase it because it will sound \"dumb\" to you after a bit,\nbut that is only because you are growing really quickly, catching up, others still need the simpler thoughts.\n\nA lot of people will stay in bed,\nthey will meet the deadline, and that snooze button will slowly turn their joy of life off.\n\nThere is still hope for them, maybe the boss will be super crazy and mean, hopefully,\nshe could then come around and tell them \"Hey! you will never get a raise again?\", that could still snap them out of it.\n\nBut, if the boss is not fully crazed,\nyou are their last hope.\n\nThe trouble you go through to learn to jog,\nor try to hit every state park, without really caring much for actually making it to Key West.\n\nAs all end of the road towns are tourist traps,\nso, it is true when they say it is the journey, not the destination.\n\nExcept maybe for those six toed cats that Ernest Hemingway left behind in his Key West home,\nvery few things will surprise you with independence, and a cat probably capable of of grasping tools is one of them.\n\nYeah, all the trouble, and little pit stops, and furry or maned discoveries, serve as a call to health,\nto all those who are almost ready for it, but not quite there.\n\nNo human should lead the life of a house cat,\nwe are very dynamic, and doing beautiful unusual things helps us stay healthy.\n\nOne, time, I camped next to a couple that brought their two year old to a hike-in site,\nit was clearly the husband's idea, the wife was angry, and the kid was crying...\n\nIt was a nice try, but they needed more vacations, and more babysitters,\nand not just camping, but jogging, trail running, and a plan to visit all the famous lighthouses.\n\nI am sure she loved the trouble of camping when they started dating,\nnow the inconvenience of it all was making the poor lady, angry, out of the storm of stress.\n\nI am certain, that she was blaming her self for it,\nand thinking of her self as just that kind of a person, nobody is angry like that.\n\nBetween the three of them, they had everything in the universe, except the trouble was so overwhelming and the fog-of-war so thick.\nThat this, clearly, mighty and courageous mom, was only racing forward to get stuff done.\n\nThey stayed the weekend,\nbut they needed at least three weeks if not months.\n\nThey needed to stop racing forward,\nthey needed more adventures, more \"inconvenience\", more trouble-making as I call it.\n\nThat woman in particular struck me as someone who needed to run the Western States 100,\nshe had the power for it, no, she has a soul for it.\n\nSee emanated the mana that bespoke that,\nthe standard marathons needed to qualify for western states meant nothing to her, it was just a blistering formality.\n\nAnyway, still a glorious couple,\nand their little one will surely grow up to be an adventurer.\n\nAside from a raccoon I named Friday, using his cute little hands to soil my hot dog buns,\nthat week brought in another mighty being - this time a teenage boy.\n\nHis father passed away, and he pushed himself too far,\nthe psychologist put him on permanent medicine.\n\nI had the great honor of speaking to him, he told me he slept in fields and ditches,\nbut he had his sister, or mom, looking out for him.\n\nHe was a Powerful Troublemaker,\nI told him we need to care for ourselves, our bodies need vitamins, electrolytes, our minds need whatever they need.\n\n\"There is no such thing as crazy,\nyou just went through a lot in life, it was your life that got crazy.\" - I said to him.\n\nA thousand miles on a bicycle, which according to my maps requires a little trip to Canada, and a ferry,\nis all the proof needed that the kid was really special.\n\nI returned to my camp, and a day or two later,\na shadowy figure visited him, his mom probably, and without me paying attention I've noticed it was a slow and mighty, and very heavy conversation.\n\nKnowing he was well, I hope he continued his bicycling, at least to the upper peninsula,\nthough there was a ferry near by, so maybe he was headed for Chicago, I hope they both went.\n\nSee, here is a child well on his way to become a great being,\nhe was learning wisdom, and all he needed was backpack, a bicycle, and a thousand miles of road.\n\nTrouble-making is no joke, it an art,\nand it is medicine worthy of great heroes.\n\nIf you, my Dear Reader, get stuck, or stung, or scared, or get stuck in a fog of war,\nknow that it is not a time to try harder, and push harder, and let me tell you why without mincing words:\n\nBecause you are absolutely irreplaceable,\nand - what you think your flaws are - aren't, they are not flaws, this is your uniqueness.\n\nYou will only exist once in the universe,\nand though you can rain wrath precisely like a god, you also need to pace yourself.\n\nThe best kind of a Warrior is a Laughing Philosopher,\nnot a Berserker (that's too easy), be an Artist.\n\nIt is a huge part of the art of living,\nto quit blaming yourself for being angry, or clumsy, or never finishing anything you start, or never finding the right person.\n\nYou are not angry, there is nothing wrong with you,\nyou just took on so much weight and made so many compromises that there is no more time left for you to be yourself.\n\nI know it sounds awful when I say something as simple and go ride a bicycle, or a horse,\nor give the campsite raccoons so much anxiety that they start clawing their way into nice people's backpacks.\n\nBut that is how it works, the way out of fog of war,\nmust be simple so that you have no trouble taking it.\n\nNo one is asking you to drop out of school permanently,\nyou're not going to be homeless, you will find a better job.\n\nYou only need to say the truth to your next employer,\nyour mental health, and your joy of life, and a balanced existence is critical to a healthy existence.\n\nJust because someone can lay down their life to meet a deadline whilst kissing ass and never asking for a raise,\nit does not mean anybody healthy will ever try.\n\nIf principals or teachers, or management or anything gets crazy on you,\ndon't quit, just don't comply because doing so will hurt you, just take a vacation, because your mental and physical health is more important than anything else, period.\n\nIf you are still not hearing this, if you are still not ready not to sacrifice yourself,\nlet me say this, there is a lot of people out there who like that Mighty Teenager do have a breaking point that will scare the bajezus out of a shrink, who is only too happy to prescribe something.\n\nYour self-compassion, your dignity, your beauty,\nand the power that your laughter, your foolishness, your silliness, your mischievousness, and above all your giggles exert on the universe that surrounds you is to important to us all for you to keep walking a path that is hurting you.\n\nYou are irreplaceable, and when you rise, and choose to share your stories,\nyou will build roads for others to follow.\n\nBy not putting up with what is hurting you,\nyou make the Universe a better place by becoming a beacon of sanity for those who will hear of your adventures.\n\nReturning to school or job with with this dignity and integrity of mind,\nwill change the way people treat you.\n\nNot just your confidence, but your wisdom, and strength, and balance,\nwill alter your body language.\n\nStressed people and relaxed people, give off different behavioral clues,\npeople including those in charge of budgets can read that very easily.\n\nTerrible people who lack compassion are everywhere,\nsometimes stressed out people will be abused with more stress just because they keep taking it on.\n\nThings get supremely complicated,\nin ways that we can't always understand.\n\nFor example the reason why someone loses their 4.0 may have nothing to do with their performance,\nbut with the teacher giving out too many A/s in the previous semester, and now just trying to average things out with the people who never complain, so that the dean doesn't come around complaining that his class sticks out.\n\nIt doesn't matter if it is High School, or College, or what used to be a Dream Job,\nthere are unethical fake it until you make it people covering their asses everywhere, it is a tragedy that someone like that should become a reason behind someone's years of suffering.\n\nThese are simple examples I am making up,\nin real life, there is no understanding of all the motives as people who never grew up, constantly interact with each other to to do less, and get more,\n\nTrouble-making is just a lighthearted way of leaving all that noise behind,\nand regaining your own beauty, and strengths, and awe for the world around you.\n\nGive yourself some trouble that actually makes you better for a change.\nif the path you re walking on feels wrong, you need to begin preparing an adventure backpack.\n\nA very special Monday is coming around,\nyour clock will go off just like always.\n\nBut this time it will die with a sad whimper as you - slowly and deliberately - unplug it from the wall,\nand return to sleep, not worried about your deadline, job or school, but simply knowing full well, that they don't matter anymore; because your well being is infinitely more important.\n\nThen get into your car, or on a bus, and set a direction for sunny weather,\ndrive, fly, just go, and do not wait to create your rules of adventure, do it as soon as possible.\n\nWhen your health returns to you,\nyou'll know exactly where you are going, and schools will always take you back, and jobs that hurt you are now worthy of your concern at all.\n\nDon't make plans about the rest of your life until you catch up where you need to be and become wiser as think things through.\n\nAnd finally, if you don't like the idea of trouble making,\nthen between You and I let us call it: Love of Life.",

weight and made so many compromises that there is no more time left for you to be yourself.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I know it sounds awful when I say something as simple and go ride a bicycle, or a horse,</p>\n  <p>or give the campsite raccoons so much anxiety that they start clawing their way into nice people&apos;s backpacks.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But that is how it works, the way out of fog of war,</p>\n  <p>must be simple so that you have no trouble taking it.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>No one is asking you to drop out of school permanently,</p>\n  <p>you&apos;re not going to be homeless, you will find a better job.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You only need to say the truth to your next employer,</p>\n  <p>your mental health, and your joy of life, and a balanced existence is critical to a healthy existence.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Just because someone can lay down their life to meet a deadline whilst kissing ass and never asking for a raise,</p>\n  <p>it does not mean anybody healthy will ever try.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If principals or teachers, or management or anything gets crazy on you,</p>\n  <p>don&apos;t quit, just don&apos;t comply because doing so will hurt you, just take a vacation, because your mental and physical health is more important than anything else, period.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If you are still not hearing this, if you are still not ready not to sacrifice yourself,</p>\n  <p>let me say this, there is a lot of people out there who like that Mighty Teenager do have a breaking point that will scare the bajezus out of a shrink, who is only too happy to prescribe something.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Your self-compassion, your dignity, your beauty,</p>\n  <p>and the power that your laughter, your foolishness, your silliness, your mischievousness, and above all your giggles exert on the universe that surrounds you is to important to us all for you to keep walking a path that is hurting you.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You are irreplaceable, and when you rise, and choose to share your stories,</p>\n  <p>you will build roads for others to follow.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>By not putting up with what is hurting you,</p>\n  <p>you make the Universe a better place by becoming a beacon of sanity for those who will hear of your adventures.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Returning to school or job with with this dignity and integrity of mind,</p>\n  <p>will change the way people treat you.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Not just your confidence, but your wisdom, and strength, and balance,</p>\n  <p>will alter your body language.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Stressed people and relaxed people, give off different behavioral clues,</p>\n  <p>people including those in charge of budgets can read that very easily.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Terrible people who lack compassion are everywhere,</p>\n  <p>sometimes stressed out people will be abused with more stress just because they keep taking it on.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Things get supremely complicated,</p>\n  <p>in ways that we can&apos;t always understand.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>For example the reason why someone loses their 4.0 may have nothing to do with their performance,</p>\n  <p>but with the teacher giving out too many A/s in the previous semester, and now just trying to average things out with the people who never complain, so that the dean doesn&apos;t come around complaining that his class sticks out.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It doesn&apos;t matter if it is High School, or College, or what used to be a Dream Job,</p>\n  <p>there are unethical fake it until you make it people covering their asses everywhere, it is a tragedy that someone like that should become a reason behind someone&apos;s years of suffering.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>These are simple examples I am making up,</p>\n  <p>in real life, there is no understanding of all the motives as people who never grew up, constantly interact with each other to to do less, and get more,</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Trouble-making is just a lighthearted way of leaving all that noise behind,</p>\n  <p>and regaining your own beauty, and strengths, and awe for the world around you.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Give yourself some trouble that actually makes you better for a change.</p>\n  <p>if the path you re walking on feels wrong, you need to begin preparing an adventure backpack.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>A very special Monday is coming around,</p>\n  <p>your clock will go off just like always.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But this time it will die with a sad whimper as you - slowly and deliberately - unplug it from the wall,</p>\n  <p>and return to sleep, not worried about your deadline, job or school, but simply knowing full well, that they don&apos;t matter anymore; because your well being is infinitely more important.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Then get into your car, or on a bus, and set a direction for sunny weather,</p>\n  <p>drive, fly, just go, and do not wait to create your rules of adventure, do it as soon as possible.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>When your health returns to you,</p>\n  <p>you&apos;ll know exactly where you are going, and schools will always take you back, and jobs that hurt you are now worthy of your concern at all.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Don&apos;t make plans about the rest of your life until you catch up where you need to be and become wiser as think things through.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And finally, if you don&apos;t like the idea of trouble making,</p>\n  <p>then between You and I let us call it: Love of Life.</p>\n</div>",

we reset back to some 20,000 or 50,000 years ago,\nwe end up living in villages and inventing gods to help with harvest and afterlife.\n\nOrganized and mandatory education is a recent invention,\nit works up to middle school where teachers begin hiding inexperience behind abstractions.\n\nWhen teaching a class of multiple students there is only time for lowest common denominators,\neverything gets hurried along and those who can't understand something begin memorizing.\n\nWithin a few years everyone is temporarily memorizing everything to be sure they graduate,\nthose who try to learn, are graded down under the threat of being held back and repeating the year.\n\nNobody is learning anything useful, everyone is memorizing,\nand teachers, grades, and threats of being held back only reinforce memorization.\n\nThat is not education,\nthat is memorization, acting.\n\nOur loading program does not load,\nour operating system does not initialize.\n\nSystem crashes,\nand fathers eagerly send their boys to kill boys of other fathers.\n\nPolitics becomes infested with pretenders, actors, con-men, and simple liars,\nvoters simply don't think about electing people who show wisdom, who share books.\n\nLack of modern knowledge and the stress it begets will slow people down,\nit will be difficult to become wise, it may not be possible to become great.\n\nFailure to propagate modern knowledge, seems to take the shape of,\nan uneducated majority, and a tiny educated minority without any voting power.\n\nOnce the failure of education takes hold,\nnothing can be done to fix the anomalies that occur afterwards.\n\nThe only way to help things along is to avoid the emergence of anomalies in the first place,\nand that means having a functional educational system.\n\nIf it is not possible for a nation to teach its children,\nif the dream of organized, mandatory and standardized education is not realistic.\n\nPersonalized computer based, self education must be put in its place,\nthe transition can be made easy by transitioning from grades to money, credits, or bonds.\n\nThe initial computer based curricula would grow the same way the world encyclopedia did,\na little bit at a time, from all directions, as students are rewarded for following their curiosities.\n\nI write this in year 2020 when it seems that all our old mistakes have reemerged,\nbut what is actually going on is that mis-educated people are self assembling into desperate groups.\n\nWe are seeing groups self-reinforcing each other's beliefs based on color of skin,\nthey come together to form communities because of an imaginary superiority a color.\n\nWe have a nation that treats women with he permanent legal status of a minor,\nof someone who is less than 18 years old, and politicians do not know to become enraged by this.\n\nWe have two nations that feature concentration camps,\nand the Land of the Free that practices torture under the guise of enhanced interrogation.\n\nAll of this is happening because of failure of schooling,\ninability of politicians to build.\n\nNow, let me close with a heart warming thought experiment,\nwhich deep down I hope some magnificent nation a thousand years in the future may try for real.\n\nWe can all agree that, education is an investment in a nation's future,\nand that pretending to teach children by forcing them into memorization can destroy a nation.\n\nLet us say that, in this thought experiment, unless a better program is in place,\ncountries should pay their students for achievement, not with imaginary letters but with real money.\n\nStudents in elementary should be getting paid just as much money as college students,\nand the amount that they bring home should be equal that of a prestigious job.\n\nAfter all what is more prestigious than the child's real knowledge,\na child will soon become a politician, investor, leader, and inspiration for others to follow.\n\nMaking some $200,000 a year in 2020 money, is an amazing way for a nation to show respect its students,\nand it will proudly display how much more important they are in proportion to the defense budget.\n\nGraduation, would leave a student not with crippling debt that can't be erased with bankruptcy,\nbut with just about $3.2 million dollars in their account, that is how a graduate should start life.\n\nThe cost of this is irrelevant, these are hundreds of trillions of dollars per year that simply add to our national debt,\nthis is what it means to have a country.\n\nWhat we see today, is poverty, children going hungry, fake education, ineffective politics,\nand research and legalization of dangerous drugs for the purpose of erasing stress, and PTSD born from poverty.\n\nWe cannot allow ourselves to live in the fantasy land,\nwhere it is OK for one nation to teach their children that another needs to be destroyed.\n\nWe cannot allow ourselves to live in the fantasy of a limited number of abstract virtual pieces of paper,\nthat sometimes make children die of starvation.\n\nHumanity, has outgrown the type of primitive small town thinking that we see today,\nit has outgrown it probably more than a hundred years ago when large cities started growing.\n\nFor those of you who are still laughing at my though experiment,\ntake a lesson from the way early internet social networks would reform themselves.\n\nInitially switching to more automated, more statistics and probability oriented systems,\nwould set their platforms on fire and cause waves of disturbance, but that is how things adapt to growing larger.\n\nCall it growing pains, call it Love of Humanity, call it a nation at a stand still,\nin process of not just erasing poverty but creating an overabundance of wealth for its students.\n\nOut of Love and Wisdom,\nout of Greatness of Vision, and of yearning for other nations to follow onward to World Peace, Safety and Equality.\n\nAnd my final words are a question,

about paying those fraudulent institutions - instead of funding ones that are capable of Real Education.\n\nThings are pretty bad, thankfully, we are infinite in our capacity to deal with real dangers,\nespecially the ones that tear tear our family apart.\n\nReal education is based on students' predispositions,\nand curiosities.\n\nFor example, when someone is interested in the moon or stars at night,\nthat marks an entry point into Science Fiction, Astrophysics, Astrography and if they continue to care, Optics, Mathematics, Physics, Writing and so on.\n\nMost children won't care for stars very long, because they are interested in exploring all of the universe,\nand that is even better because then there is a multitude of passage ways they can use to walk through the sciences.\n\nBut it has to be their own walking, their own direction, and at their own pace,\nwe have to honor their predispositions and curiosities, the students are the future.\n\nWe have to remove grades, tests, graduation, class rooms, time divisions, subject divisions, rows of seats, groupings of any kind be it age or area of study,\nwe have to replace the teacher with personalized learning and tutors.\n\nAnd we have to give the students what they need, a telescope, a fast single board computer with all the sensors and servos they could ever need,\nthey need the ability to launch satellites, to operate small remotely operated submarines and small drones, they need access to things they are curious about.\n\nIf a student is walking the wrong path, then it is a path that has been been walked many times before, they are asking a question, and they need powerful answers,\nthey have to see what war is like, what prisons are like, what concentration camps are like -

you for your Great Achievements.\n\nThe diploma you receive at the end of your stay in school,\nwhile it grants you access to higher institutions and more advanced jobs...\n\n...it will not prevent those jobs from endangering or sacrificing you for profit,\nthe best lies are the ones that others maneuver you into believing, choices you would never make without their poison.\n\nYour life, does not compare to other lives, no matter how precious or numerous,\nthere is no Life Arithmetic.\n\nThe closest you can get to a formula is this wonderful contradiction:\nEach life is more important than the other.\n\nIf someone ever asks you to do something for the greater good, you are not sacrifice,\nyou quit your job or await your dishonorable discharge, and begin your search for Enlightenment and Wisdom, onward to becoming a Great Being.\n\nIf the best job you can possibly get, holds some measure of risk,\nthen you are going to need to try harder.\n\nIn case you are wondering,\n- I care, and you can't undo that.\n\nThe harder, or the less worn path,\nis that of becoming an Independent Inventor and Entrepreneur.\n\nAnd you are not going to be the first or only one,\nfind the others, find a couple of co-founders, learn from your Noble Failures as well as Triumphant Successes.\n\nSo when someone says \"Diploma\",\nyou reply; \"Check Your Premise\", to quote an old friend.\n\nWhen they say calculator,\nyou say: \"Help me with programming not memorizing formulas.\"\n\nWhen they box you in to memorize,\nyou get the others to drop the class, because you need a real education, one that helps you to wisdom and greatness.\n\nWhile governments are smart enough to encourage learning,\nas evidenced by mandatory education, they are not smart enough to tell a real education from a fake one.\n\nI suspect the intelligence of governments is dictated purely by the voters,\nin that wise people will not vote in uneducated representatives.\n\nBut you see the small catch-22 or egg and chicken problem,\na government can't easily become intelligent enough to encourage real education, without majority of voters being educated for real.\n\nThe way to do boot the process and hopefully sustain it,\nis to mirror the educational paths of pioneers and founders, in a short: Self Education.\n\nSelf education is not that outrageous,\nthat is what real schools are supposed to encourage you to do, without any interference.\n\nAnd let me underline that interference will destroy self education,\ngrades, cookie cutter curricula, the threat of repeating classes or even semesters can destroy a beautiful and delicate mind.\n\nSelf education is like learning to walk, except this time you learn to move in the Universe,\nand instead of getting your feet to move quite right, you are trying to find the audio books that somewhat fit what you already know.\n\nFinally on a related subject, it hurts me to say it, but \"Free College\" is not quite right,\nit should be \"Free Real and Effective Education that Shows Real Results\"\n\nCompare that to the an Important Vaccine, we don't need a mere Free Shot of Something spelled out with weasel words,\nwe need a real and effective vaccine that shows real results across millions of participants.\n\nYou should not allow yourself to think of College or University as something that gets you a good job,\na good job is nothing, the dumbest of liars can get you fired if you get in their way.\n\nThe thing you must look for is Knowledge, Wisdom, and Greatness,\nas that opens all the gateways ahead of you; but more importantly that path is most worthy of you, it is the most human and healthiest of paths.\n\nAll you need to start is a small bowl of ice cream, an electric blanket, a fine pillow, a comfy bed,\nand a narrated book by Carl Sagan, or Neil deGrasse Tyson, or Bill Bryson.\n\nAnd then as you get going, and maybe take to liking new titles from best-seller lists and new authors you have never heard of,\nfind a a small, perhaps, pocket sized, well respected book on Bush Craft, and start getting ready for your first tiny venture into the Wild by buying a backpack and a tent...\n\nYou will need a pair of cut proof gloves, a 16\" Bowie knife (don't do 14\"), get high quality Damascus, Stag Horn Handle, fine leather sheath, full tang, obviously...\nand a second actually useful Bush Craft Knife, and then splurge on a sharp fordable hand saw you can bring along to all adventures, and get an audio book, and fire going as everyone else is still hacking away.\n\nAs you read more and more,\nand things start making sense, as you slowly and independently begin forming an accurate view of the world.\n\nBring a cheerful friend, or your mum, to a near by state park,\none with a fine beach and a tidy nick-knack store that also doubles as a hot dog stand and perhaps serves a fine and spicy vegetarian alternative.\n\nLater on, grab couple of lovely and trusting friends,\nfool enough to try to through-hike the Applachin Trail with you in one go from Springer Mountain to Mount Katahdin.\n\nThough I highly recommend section hiking at first,\nand also, please, please, visit Henry at Walden Pond each time you climb Katahdin.\n\nYou know, it is hard to miss the fact that a tent in bear country makes for a fine dorm room,\nand that each white blaze you meet on the AT, doubles as an A+ that no teacher could possibly give you.\n\nAnd that each time you make it up Katahdin with a hundred new books on your mind,\nyou do graduate ever higher.\n\nI think both Henry and the Mountain grant you some of their height\n- I know for certain without a doubt; and I know you can feel it too: You are meant to become a Great Being.",

class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Lack of education breeds desperation,</p>\n  <p>not only will the voters be confused, but the politicians won&apos;t understand them either.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>A world where leaders place their needs above the people they swore to represent,</p>\n  <p>and do the bare minimum for maximum personal gains, is a world that needs vision.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>On the other hand, a well educated, knowledgeable and wise voting majority,</p>\n  <p>isn&apos;t one to get confused, or become mislead, easily.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>A vision is always something that most of humanity has already agreed on,</p>\n  <p>though they might have forgotten parts here and there, or worded them differently.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>For example:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Climate Stabilization</p>\n  <p>Human Dignity</p>\n  <p>World Peace</p>\n  <p>Universal Human Rights</p>\n  <p>World Disarmament</p>\n  <p>Functional Education</p>\n  <p>End Of Poverty All Around The World</p>\n  <p>Universal Basic Income</p>\n  <p>World Unity</p>\n  <p>Justice</p>\n  <p>Authenticity, and Truth.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>As we progress from well-read, to knowledgeable, to wise, and onward to our greatness,</p>\n  <p>we will collect and hold in our hearts many such Hopes and Dreams.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>At first they may seem like words or beautiful ideas,</p>\n  <p>but as we look into Memoirs, and beloved and honored works of great story tellers, they will become more.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>With a few dozen books a concept that has been lost on leaders of humanity,</p>\n  <p>will come to life in our hearts.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Rather than trying to flawlessly comprehend the world,</p>\n  <p>which may not be possible due to too many liars who by definition lack in vision, and are merely responding to stimuli for maximum self gain.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>We gain the ability hold up several of our most beloved Aims, Hopes and Dreams,</p>\n  <p>and ask what are the leaders doing to fulfill them.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It is much easier to look at a leader&apos;s sum of history,</p>\n  <p>and notice that they have never done anything meaningful for World Peace and Elimination of Poverty, than to await their promises to come true.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>We can then ask, if we want to vote on people who do not recognize World Peace and Elimination of Poverty as an aim,</p>\n  <p>and what those people must be like.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>More importantly, holding a meaningful vision helps us grow up stronger and faster,</p>\n  <p>helps us focus our energies and curiosities on things that we become passionate about.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>When a wise voting majority becomes passionate about Human Dignity,</p>\n  <p>the strength that arises from Unity of Vision can easily repair World&apos;s Nations and help Humanity Grow.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Without a wise consensus things that are concurring around the world are probably mostly random,</p>\n  <p>with elections won by those who spend most money on taking on a pleasing shape, and disasters being a predictable result of corruption and shortsightedness.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It is hard to blame leaders and voters for something as disabling as lack of education,</p>\n  <p>people who lack knowledge pave their ways with their best intentions, alas Humanity&apos;s most beloved works of non-fiction must come first, lest we continue repeating the same old mistakes.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>There is nothing difficult</p>\n  <p>about falling in love with Good Ideas,</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>When we take to Adventures and Books, and a new book surprises us with a like selection of Hopes and Dreams,</p>\n  <p>we can only discover how connected we all really are, that we are in fact one big family.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>What are your Hopes and Dreams?</p>\n  <p>What is your Vision of The Future Of Humanity?</p>\n</div>",

      "text": "Music Theory is not something you learn or study,\nit is something you independently invent.\n\nMusic theory contains a very important lesson,\nthere is an infinity within.\n\nYou can spend a life inventing music,\nbut you have to stop yourself, to live one.\n\nSimilarly, you can spend a lifetime\ntrying to create photo-realistic paintings.\n\nBut it is best to let the brush be a brush,\nand let the paining say that it is a painting.\n\nThe perfection of a painting\nis found in the rays of the sun it contains.\n\nThe perfection of a song,\nis found in the way it makes a dancer's body move.\n\nTo sit down with sound synthesizers\nis more about meditation than composition.\n\nThere are libraries of pre-made sounds out there,\nand it is not a terrible thing to use them.\n\nJust like it is better to learn to make songs,\nby trying to replicate existing ones.\n\nIt is better to learn about good sound synthesis,\nby making use of pre made sounds or sample.\n\nThe samples that you fall in love with,\nwill call to you, and eventually you'll recreate them.\n\nOnce you create a really good song that connects with you,\nyou can then re-synthesize your own version of the sounds within.\n\nMusic is about having fun, it is about creating beautiful things,\nit is not about slaving over bare bone sound synthesis.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that sharing fun, is even more fun,\nsongs that help people dance, may just be the loveliest kind of songs.\n\nLet us make a strange little dance song,\nout of existing sound samples.\n\nWe'll use the sounds found in\nSam Aaron's Sonic Pi project.\n\nIt is not a bad idea to start with the Rhythm of the song first,\nthe rhythm is like a foundation onto which we can add Harmony and Melody.\n\nIf we started with Melody first,\nthe melody would not tell us much about the rhythm of the song.\n\nStarting with rhythm we can get our foot tapping,\nand those taps will dictate how that melody will move.\n\nUsing ready made samples\nwe can instantly get a nice drum setup going.\n\n*song plays*\n\nAnd then sprinkle in a bit of hats, or cymbals,\nnow to be fair, we got to get our shoes on, and dance it out.\n\nA dance song must always be tested,\nagainst the type of dancing that it will be used for.\n\nHere are the fist three sections,\na clumsy intro, a cymbal free beat, and then the initial enchilada.\n\n*song plays*\n\nIt is at 130 beats per minute, and it is reasonably danceable,\nit is nothing too special, but it is a danceable rhythm.\n\nWe can bend it a little bit,\nbut we have to mindful of our dancer.\n\nThey are currently meditating to our song,\nand we must not interrupt their mediation.\n\nOr they'll skip the song,\nand later remove the song from their play list.\n\nIt is a sad fact of life,\nthat no matter how good our song is.\n\nIt will stop being catchy to the dancer,\nin less than 30 days.\n\nThere is nothing you can do,\nyour song will expire like produce.\n\nWhile we are on the dancer's mind,\nwe can bring them some joy by alternating moods as the song progresses.\n\nLet us create a more intense mood in what we have so far,\nby adding bass.\n\nBass is still a low frequency sound like the drums,\nbut it is less percussive (as in hitting a drum) and more stretched as in a whistle.\n\nOne common example of bass is a bass guitar,\nit is low and deep, but unlike the drum the sound it makes is long.\n\nLet me take a moment and explain how melodies,\nincluding bass, as bass guitar usually plays simple melody get created.\n\nThe rule of melody making is keep it simple and sweet,\nand I am not joking about this.\n\nThe creation is so simple that all we need to create a melody,\nis dots and lines.\n\nMoreover, it almost does not matter how the dots and lines are arranged,\nso as long as they go up and down a little bit.\n\n(Just to clarify, the dots and lines I am referring to, represent long ans short sounds,\nis basically what you would see on an cowboy era automatic-player-piano sheet.)\n\nLet us go over to a text to Morse code translator,\nand convert the word meow to Morse code for our melody.\n\n*beeps play*\n\nThis does not sound very good because it is the same note,\nit is as boring as whistling the same tone:\n\n*whistle -- / . / --- / .--*\n\nSo let us very gently vary the notes used in our melody here,\njust gently going left and right with our finger on the piano.\n\nWhen making melodies, you can skip two keys, maybe three,\nbut don't make a huge jump of four notes, because then you have to search for notes that go well together.\n\nInterestingly enough if you have a piano handy and never played it,\nyou can easily improvise a song by pressing a key to a tempo, and then just gently moving left and right.\n\nAs a bonus try to keep rhythm with the low frequency keys on your left,\nthat will be your \"piano drum\" and your right hand will give the melody.\n\nAs an extra bonus try pressing two or three keys at the same time to create a chord,\nthis will make a richer sound - you'll probably make a better song than I am making right now...\n\nHere is what our Morse code melody sounds like, in low bass,\nwith a couple of gentle changes to sync it up top the back beat.\n\n*song plays*\n\nand here it is with drums:\n\n*song plays*\n\nRemember, that all the samples you are using, are uniquely stacked together,\nvery few other songs will use the same bass sample, with whatever you put on top of it.\n\nThe way to think about bass is this:\na fuzzy and furry container for higher pitched melodies.\n\nIt almost has the same result as hall effect has on old school computer chip tunes,\nbut here you are not relying on an echo to blend beeps into something richer,\n\nYou are relying on hand picked bass sample, or even a real guitar,\nand there ain't no nothing wrong with that.\n\nSo now that we have the beat, the hat/cymbals, and the bass,\nwe now need to add that melody that goes on top of the bass, that will melt into the bass.\n\nNow, before we you add a melody, you need to take a breath of fresh air,\nwe can't pretend that music creation is a science, it is a exploratory and generative process.\n\nSo we have to listen, and understand to the soul of the song we have just created,\nmy use of the Morse code, is kind of already whispering something.\n\nWhen you really listen to the melody our Morse code created,\nit sounds Russian.\n\nWe have to listen to the song,\nthe song is dictating a certain path through a maze of infinite complexity.\n\nIn this situation,\nI went NASA's website and borrowed the sound of Спутник (ракета-носитель)\n\nAnd our little Sputnik gives us melody,\nhere is what it sounds like.\n\n*song plays*\n\nAt this point we have a tird of a song,\nit is not a bad idea to end the song, with a variation on the begining, without ading anything new.\n\nSo that gives us about a minute and a half,\nand we only need about 60 more seconds, as our dancer has better songs to dance to.\n\nSince our song wants to be russion, let us grab a recording of an old russian number station from wikipedia,\nand sprinkle in a bit more more sputnik at the end.\n\nI chose to decorate the center of the song with a piano,\nas that will pleasantly surprise our dancer.\n\nOverall the songe ended up being very tanky,\nbut it is dancable.\n\nIf I had to do something differently,\nit would be spending more time replicationg and studying othr songs to make the song less Heavy Industries and more Cutting Shapes.\n\nIn closing, Building songs should not rely on a pre-set recipe,\nit is a creative process that should invole lots of randomness and pleanty of dancing.\n\nHere is the full song we just created,\n*song plays*.\n\n\n[Sam Aaron]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lTZ8Tuyu5I\n[NASA's website]: https://www.nasa.gov/connect/sounds/index.html\n[Спутник (ракета-носитель)]:

theory contains a very important lesson,</p>\n  <p>there is an infinity within.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You can spend a life inventing music,</p>\n  <p>but you have to stop yourself, to live one.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Similarly, you can spend a lifetime</p>\n  <p>trying to create photo-realistic paintings.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But it is best to let the brush be a brush,</p>\n  <p>and let the paining say that it is a painting.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The perfection of a painting</p>\n  <p>is found in the rays of the sun it contains.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The perfection of a song,</p>\n  <p>is found in the way it makes a dancer&apos;s body move.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>To sit down with sound synthesizers</p>\n  <p>is more about meditation than composition.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>There are libraries of pre-made sounds out there,</p>\n  <p>and it is not a terrible thing to use them.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Just like it is better to learn to make songs,</p>\n  <p>by trying to replicate existing ones.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It is better to learn about good sound synthesis,</p>\n  <p>by making use of pre made sounds or sample.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The samples that you fall in love with,</p>\n  <p>will call to you, and eventually you&apos;ll recreate them.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Once you create a really good song that connects with you,</p>\n  <p>you can then re-synthesize your own version of the sounds within.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Music is about having fun, it is about creating beautiful things,</p>\n  <p>it is not about slaving over bare bone sound synthesis.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It is important to keep in mind that sharing fun, is even more fun,</p>\n  <p>songs that help people dance, may just be the loveliest kind of songs.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Let us make a strange little dance

<p>the rhythm is like a foundation onto which we can add Harmony and Melody.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If we started with Melody first,</p>\n  <p>the melody would not tell us much about the rhythm of the song.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Starting with rhythm we can get our foot tapping,</p>\n  <p>and those taps will dictate how that melody will move.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Using ready made samples</p>\n  <p>we can instantly get a nice drum setup going.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div

we got to get our shoes on, and dance it out.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>A dance song must always be tested,</p>\n  <p>against the type of dancing that it will be used for.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Here are the fist three sections,</p>\n  <p>a clumsy intro, a cymbal free beat, and then the initial enchilada.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div

danceable rhythm.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>We can bend it a little bit,</p>\n  <p>but we have to mindful of our dancer.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>They are currently meditating to our song,</p>\n  <p>and we must not interrupt their mediation.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Or

<p>right after the melody is done playing turn off your beat, drums and base, just for a second.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Let us make a very simple and minimalist song,</p>\n  <p>that touches upon the more important components of techno.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The special thing about this song is that it will capture the progress of making it self,</p>\n  <p>so as we start you will only hear the sub layer, because the sub layer is the first thing we will work on.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>We will then add the mid layer,</p>\n  <p>and you will hear that as the song plays, you will hear the sub layer enriched with the mid layer, and so on.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The Sub Bass Layer, is a low and boring pattern at first,</p>\n  <p>but once we get to the drum and hats we are going to mess it up, and our song will become richer for it.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Here is the simple version:</p>\n  <p>* SOUND OF SUB BASS *</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Now the Mid Bass Layer, it is a little bit more complex, and more notes are going to be hit,</p>\n  <p>these are very machine like sounds you can hear the electricity here.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I think this is the most memorable part of hearing techno for the first time,</p>\n  <p>I thought to my self when I was little &quot;that is the electronic in electronic music&quot;.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>* MID BASS *</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Now that three is something going on in our ears,</p>\n  <p>now that we are sure our song will not be empty between the drums.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>We add a pronounced drum, and we have to make sure to space everything out,</p>\n  <p>so that our bass is not covered by the drum, we want out the sounds coming through.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I grew up with shorter sounding drums,</p>\n  <p>ones powered by electricity and controlled by good old knobs.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Here is what the song sounds like with our snappy drums now,</p>\n  <p>* DRUM *</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Now we have a song going, we got bass we got drums,</p>\n  <p>personally at this point I would add hats with a shaker to blend them in, kind of serve as an echo.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But instead we are going to warp the sub bass layer to give our song a sub pattern,</p>\n  <p>I want you to hear it nice and clear.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In the first half of the sample that is about to play the the sub bass plays in a perfect sequence,</p>\n  <p>in the second half you&apos;ll hear something come out of control.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Even though we only have sub bass, mid bass and drums, it sounds like something else is going on.</p>\n  <p>* SUB BASS VARIATION *</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Now we add hats to make the song come alive, to get that main energy,</p>\n  <p>it is not always best to add the shaker at the same time.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The shaker is basically the hat echo effect,</p>\n  <p>and if we have a clean melody, we may only wish to hear crisp hats.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>So let us add the shaker separately in the next step,</p>\n  <p>here are the hats:</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>* HAT INTRODUCTION *</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And now let us add the shaker,</p>\n  <p>I like my shaker short.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>* SHAKER DEMONSTRATION *</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Now let us add a simple melody as the main lead,</p>\n  <p>there is no trick to it just find whatever you like.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>* MELODY *</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>This is one of my favorites, it comes from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi5VTBdKbFM\">Chopin&apos;s &#xC9;tude Op. 10, No. 12</a>,</p>\n  <p>also known as the Revolutionary &#xC9;tude.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>At fist I start of with a short snippet that leaves the listener wanting,</p>\n  <p>and then then I expand with a slightly sharper and longer variation that you heard here.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>This is my go to song when I am studying something,</p>\n  <p>my music teacher made it so that I would hate Chopin, but I failed that class.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It is important that you reach out to big names for ideas,</p>\n  <p>beautiful songs are great teachers, and we should all learn from the best.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Teachers that make us pretend to learn by forcing us to memorize under a threat of repeating a year,</p>\n  <p>are just frauds.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If there is one thing that you take away from this tutorial it should be that you are a genius,</p>\n  <p>and that greatness is not a privilege for the lucky few.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Greatness is a reward for reading books, acquiring functional knowledge,</p>\n  <p>and building a beautiful body of wisdom.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>* here is the song in full *</p>\n</div>",

than thou\" s**t,\nsomething important is taken away from you.\n\nAnd not just important to you,\nimportant to Humanity, to History.\n\nBeing born a genius is fake too,\nit is bad etiquette to use that word once you do master something.\n\nThe word Genius, or Savant,\nis a bad word, because it has been used to rob Humanity of Beauty.\n\nWhen teachers grade you down, for something you forgot,\nbecause you never used it, or they tried to teach you in an abstract setting and it made no sense.\n\nOr they forced you to memorize it so you could perform on a test like an actor,\nor just told you that the world is not fair.\n\nThey committed the same crime against you,\nand against Humanity, and History.\n\nTheir motive, is not sick superiority,\nbut just getting paid, for a job they often hate, so that thy can another miserable day as a fraud.\n\nThe number of Great Dreamers that were prevented from growing because of teachers,\nis so high, that one can only weep.\n\nWe are taught to respect and listen to teachers,\nbut it is them, who have sold the world.\n\n(If any teachers are listening to this, it is time to stop making your kids memorize, either help them grow for real, or get out of their way,\nremember those old metaphors, what goes around comes around, you reap what you sow, and whatever you send out there, you get back times three.)\n\nOnce you play the

the critics from trying to stop you, is to stop listening.\n\nStop listening to people that are not just saying you can't,\nbut attempt to convince you with fake education, fake meaningless grades, and endless insults.\n\nNever forget that you can make your own competition,\none attached to a school you build, perhaps a virtual school for all.\n\nPerhaps not just a school where you teach how to use Digital Audio Workstations,\nbut how to use Programming Languages the way Sam Aaron uses them.\n\nAnd certainly a school,\nwhere you put an end to killing souls of artists.\n\nThe French Horn is more than Tchaikovsky could grasp,\nin the primitive era that he was alive in.\n\nThat's right, this is a new era,\nan era where professional artists worry about falling behind to teenagers with computers.\n\nI know what you are thinking,\nI know nothing about notes, I can't compose.\n\nMaybe you are thinking,\nI don't know music theory.\n\nOr perhaps,\nI don't know what a French Horn even, freaking is.\n\nBut,\nis this what your ear worries about?\n\nMusic, is not about knowing where to put your fingers,\nit is about creating a road forward, one of Beauty and adventure.\n\nI want you to hear, what it is like to compose music from your soul,\nfrom your heart, unafraid, in a world where if you fail, you will come back the next day.\n\nAnd the next day, you will feel nothing but certainty,\nand a kinship with all the others, including Tchaikovsky, no matter how old fashioned his use of The Horn is.\n\nAnd if you fail again, and my goodness I hope you do, then, then, your mind will begin taking notes apart, it will rip through brass,\nout of an animal like yearning for comprehension of composition.\n\nIt will come as automatically as running, as learning to ride a bicycle,\nin just a few more failures, just a few more failures, you will earn it.\n\nYou will hear it, whatever your instrument of choice,\nyou will hear it in popular music, because there are countless other lovers out there.\n\nSome of them, still learning, some still tricked by teachers,\nothers, your upcoming competition, racing forward as fast as yo are.\n\nThis is our world now... the world of the electron and the mouse,\nthe beauty of the infinite potential of the digital creations.\n\nThe Pursuit of Excellence does not distinguish,\nthe original instrument, or the synthesized one.\n\nNow, listen to how I find a note I like.\n\n* PROGRESSION OF NOTE SEEKING PLAYS *\n\nDo you know what this process of note seeking, is called?\nIt is called composition, and do not let anybody tell you otherwise.\n\nTHE PROCESS OF FINDING THE RIGHT NOTES,\nIS HOW YOU MAKE MUSIC.\n\nYOU DO NOT MAKE MUSIC,\nBY LISTENING TO TEACHERS TELLING YOU HOW MUSIC IS MADE.\n\nDo you hear me,\ndo you hear me...\n\nAnd this is not a secret, it is just how bad schools have become,\nhow easily we have listened to the teachers, how strong the imperceptible grasp of whatever it is that we perceive as authority.\n\nIf there is a secret to be had here,\nit is that school is the last place you go to learn.\n\nAnd that is is the first place.\nwhere gentle and creative minds come to an end.\n\nNow, here is the whole song, and oh my gosh, please forgive the drums at the end, I couldn't help it,\nthis is my first day learning the horn, and it is even MORE POWERFUL than I thought.\n\nAnd believe

      "text": "The term Exceptional Ability probably originated,\nin a unique process required for a US Green Card.\n\nMore recently it has been used by the CEO of a large company,\nto describe an alternative to a college diploma.\n\nPersonally, I use it as a way to show that High School and College,\nare not what they seem to be,\n\nAnd the way I want _you_ to think about it,\nis, as a private, and personal tool for self evaluation.\n\nI don't think we all need to think about having exceptional abilities,\nI think we all have that power within, and ordinary I would say most of us have better things to do.\n\nBut, I think world's schools need great repairs,\nand until they begin working properly we need a tool for thinking, a kind of a compass, and this notion of Exceptional Ability can guide our self education efforts.\n\nI want you to ask: \"Is High School providing me with Exceptional Ability?\"\n\"Is College providing me with Exceptional Ability?\".\n\nI want you to resist thinking about High School as means,\nto College, Med School, and University, which then will make your dreams come true.\n\nWe need to,\nstay on the ground.\n\nIf you are already worried, that you will ruin your life by not doing what everyone else is doing,\nstart preparing for Thru-hiking the Appalachian and Pacific Crest Trails, and begin training for Marathons, and Western States 100.\n\nExceptional ability, by definition, means that there is nobody else like you,\ngraduating from a University may actually show that your education is not exceptional.\n\nIt is not my intent to encourage everyone to think in terms of exceptional abilities,\nthat is just as dumb as using the word genius to describe one self.\n\nMy intent is to help people reach their golden age with fewer regrets,\nwe have such powerful imaginations, and such excellent patience that we are each a writer, a leader, an inventor, an inspiration.\n\nStandardized education has a tendency to discourage exceptional abilities,\nbecause, by definition, they are unique and can't be standardized or graded.\n\nThere is a teacher, and leader in all of us,\nand some people enjoy teaching and leading so much that they become Intellectual Leaders for the whole world, in a way, World's True Leaders.\n\nThe True Leaders of the world, are those who change lives for better,\ntheir books very frequently earn a permanent place in Human History, and help the world grow.\n\nThey don't want to be presidents or prime ministers,\nand they are held in such great esteem that nobody really cares to ask them to focus on anything in particular.\n\nThe True Leaders of Humanity, do the things that they are good at, that are meaningful to them,\nand then they share, be it by writing a book, or by invitation to speak.\n\nSome people that take to working on their Exceptional Abilities,\noften do go on to become these Leaders Without Borders.\n\nOne must wonder, how many are lost to High School,\nor College and University.\n\nDon't worry about ever needing to present proof of exceptional ability,\nwhatever job wants just the proof, is probably not worth your time.\n\nWhen you enter the path of helping the world grow a little bit,\nto change lives for the better, to bring enlightenment where lies caked together to create darkness, your priories will shift a little bit.\n\nThis is where Western States, and the Pacific Crest and Appalachian Trails come in handy,\nadventure gives you just about enough room, to begin weaving your next thought.\n\nAbove all, Exceptional Ability is your private self-measuring stick,\nperhaps it is best used by your elder self, in terms of imagining yourself 50 years in the future and trying to figure out what your regrets maybe at that time.\n\nImagining your Elder Self telling you whether or not you have Exceptional Ability is a fun exercise,\nno one knows your better then your wisest self.\n\nIt will take a while to learn how to make use of this tool for thinking properly,\nbut it takes little to begin asking: \"Am I on my way towards exception abilities, or not.\"\n\nIt is a tool for your own self, it cannot be used by anybody else but you,\nin deed, people that really care about you, don't need proof to know that you are exceptional.\n\nIt is a tool for our inner-selves, to make progress forward, and in such a way, that our elder selves won't be sitting around disappointed,\nthat they blew what turned out to be the only opportunity at delving a magnificently scalding Valedictorian speech that ended up igniting a Revolution In Education.\n\nIt is a tool to keep our path of self education at a consistent incline,\nso that we can be sure that come our golden age we will have all the wisdom we need.\n\nEven those of us who don't care to ponder self education and pursuits of Exceptional Abilities,\neventually do develop them so as long as they further their wisdom to no end.\n\nIf I had to describe what proof of exceptional ability, or breathtaking wisdom, looks like,\nI'd say it comes in the shape of a book, a book that changes lives for better.\n\nIf it was a science book,\nit would probably be an accessible popular science book inviting the whole world to learn along with an inspirational narrative.\n\nMost often it is probably some kind of Autobiographical Journal, maybe a Journal of Self Education,\nor Poetry, or a heavy book full of Artworks and ideas behind them, or tutorials.\n\nIf the figure in Gladwell's Outliers is anything to go by,\nthen it probably takes ten years to create, and maybe another five to write down.\n\nI think of a book, because books are great at creating descriptions,\nthough a person's work may revolve around fixing education, it would almost certainly be a book or an audio book, that would tell the story.\n\nFinally, can proof of exceptional ability be used as a substitute for a College Diploma,\nI think so, if the management appreciates your book, they will appreciate your presence as well.",

this,</p>\n  <p>they are both playing the Happy Birthday melody.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In one instance voice is used,</p>\n  <p>in the other, a piano.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>See a melody like Happy Birthday was not composed on a classical musical instrument,</p>\n  <p>the lyrics were not added after the melody was made, the melody was made with the lyrics.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Singing turns us into musical instruments,</p>\n  <p>just imagine an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2snTkaD64U\" title=\"L&apos;amour est un oiseau rebelle by Elina Garanca\">opera singer</a> or a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAfPKNSvesI\" title=\"The Owl and the Pussycat fr&#xE5;n Stockholms Universitetsk&#xF6;rs (Stockholm University Choir)\">church choir</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>A melody can be made out of words,</p>\n  <p>or a piano, or a violin, on an electric guitar, or a mix thereof.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Musical rules are mean to be broken,</p>\n  <p>the best artists pretty much aim for it.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But that is something you do on your own in your musical career,</p>\n  <p>but to get there you must first adopt a few rules as your favorite, as your initial style.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>So let us make a simple melody, in modern times a program like lmms can show you which keys belong to what scale,</p>\n  <p>and then even automatically convert your notes to chords, so knowledge of music theory in not a requirement, at all.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Rather than showing you how to create things in sequence,</p>\n  <p>which would be chords bass and melody, a task best left for a second tutorial.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I will show you how things sound when they stand alone,</p>\n  <p>how vulnerable things are until they come together.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I will do this as proof, that if you have ever made a melody before,</p>\n  <p>by drumming, or whistling, or creating your own words to a little song, you made a melody.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It was a perfect and beautiful melody,</p>\n  <p>but it was missing, the chords, and bass.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If you had all those things aligned together,</p>\n  <p>then you would have a beautiful work of art on your hands.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Before we begin, I will say that a song needs a soul,</p>\n  <p>lots of background sounds, that click together, but you can&apos;t quite hear where something starts and something ends.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It is just the center, or the background of a song,</p>\n  <p>these are called chords, multiple keys pressed together.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>A chord is simply a complex and good sounding sound,</p>\n  <p>made by pressing few piano keys together, at the same time.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>From time to time a chord can use some bass,</p>\n  <p>bass are the deep sounding notes, they aren&apos;t always audible, very often you can&apos;t hear them at all on cheap speakers.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Bass fills in whatever chords missed,</p>\n  <p>Together bass and chords, create a universe of sound.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Your melody must be born of that universe,</p>\n  <p>related to chords, but dominating the sound of the world, as if the melody was the sun.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Your melody, must not leave that world without great preparations,</p>\n  <p>if you take just the melody part, it won&apos;t last on its own.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Now let me show you what a melody outside of her universe sounds like,</p>\n  <p>and let me warn you, that it won&apos;t sound perfect,</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>There are connectors here that fit the chords,</p>\n  <p>but there are no chords, yet.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>*MELODY PLAYS*</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Now, before we get to the chords, the most complex sounding part of this melody,</p>\n  <p>let me show you what the bass sounds like.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The bass is the proto-chord, it was once the original set of notes that sparked the melody,</p>\n  <p>but now, it lives beneath everything, it serves as the ground for both chords and melody.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Here, is what it sounds like, and again I must warn you that it is very dark,</p>\n  <p>it is very, scary (and hard to hear on cheap speakers).</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>*BASS PLAYS*</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And here we arrive at the chords, the oxygen, the lovely cumulonimbus,</p>\n  <p>but also the wind, and maybe the occasional gust as well.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Note how complete the chords are, there is nothing missing here,</p>\n  <p>the chords do not call for bass, nor are they in any way hurting when the melody is not playing.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>That means you can have a section of just the cords,</p>\n  <p>perhaps with the bass to be consistent, but you do not need the melody to be playing.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>This gives you the ability to let the listener rest from the for a bit,</p>\n  <p>before you put it back in, and if you dare, and I hope you never do, you could have a stretch with just the bass, what audacity!</p>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>*CHORDS PLAY*</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Now time has come to assemble our song,</p>\n  <p>let us see what bass and chords sound like without the melody.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>*BASS AND CHORDS PLAY*</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Whoo Wee, well that certainly doesn&apos;t sound like all hat no cows,</p>\n  <p>it sounds nice like a moonlit search for wisdom.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And now finally, let us add the high pitched melody,</p>\n  <p>let us place it in the world that it belongs in.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>*BASS CHORDS AND MELODY PLAYS*</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And here is the song we created in this evenings journey,</p>\n  <p>I hope you like it.</p>\n

they don't,\nthey must understand how the formulas work, and it is easy and beautiful.\n\nTo begin learning mathematics for real, you need to even out the playing field with a simple programming language,\nbecause to quote Math As Code, \"Mathematical symbols can mean different things depending on the author, context and the field of study (linear algebra, set theory, etc).\"\n\nSo, you aren't even learning real math,\nand beyond that as you create or re-create your formulas in a simple programming language, it makes sense to plug them in, and create interactive visualizations.\n\nAnd of course, before you start learning math, you need a reason to lean math, which would be creating computer games,\ndesigning Screen Savers, Music Visualizations, Generative Art, or Generative Music, even stuff for making videos.\n\nMore than that, you can't learn math when someone tells you to,\nyour mind has to be ready, and that may take a long time.\n\nAnd you need to see the full picture, because as fun as Generative Art is,\nyou need to know why you need it...\n\nThe reason why you need generative art,\nis so that you may exhibit your works at Guggenheim, creating another product line, or helping students learn how to be more like you.\n\nThe point of it all, is to build a breathtaking portfolio,\ndescribing a series of companies that you built.\n\nI can't even imagine what schools must think we are,\nfor them to treat us the way they do, and where exactly are they directing us?\n\nCollege, Debt and Cubicle? ... College, Brand Name University, and Lab?\nAnd for how long, for ever? In a cubicle?

you.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Long time ago, we had these little schools,</p>\n  <p>that taught reading, writing, and arithmetic.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And people loved them, everyone loved and admired them,</p>\n  <p>it was a true gift, and teachers were True Angels of Wisdom.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But schools require funding,</p>\n  <p>part of that funding is paying teachers.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And what that means is:</p>\n  <p>money.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Everyone suddenly was a teacher,</p>\n  <p>and to optimize money, testing, testing, testing.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>This is not a school anymore,</p>\n  <p>this is a business, all the teachers now take a paycheck home.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The concept of grades is very iffy, very lazy, a teacher should talk to the parent.</p>\n  <p>if grades used to work, then maybe they didn&apos;t matter much, somehow.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But over time,</p>\n  <p>with everyone busy optimizing things to get or make more money.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>With schools everywhere needing funding,</p>\n  <p>with teachers needing to get paid.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Nobody would have noticed,</p>\n  <p>when grades became everything.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Same with tests, nobody noticed when lectures became too abstract,</p>\n  <p>and people just started memorizing for tests to get good grades.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>So now, we have a school, that needs funding,</p>\n  <p>teachers that need to get paid.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And lectures and tests,</p>\n  <p>setup in a way where majority passes by memorization.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And then there are those who assume that teachers are there to teach,</p>\n  <p>and that the abstract disconnected lectures actually make sense.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>They don&apos;t know everyone is memorizing,</p>\n  <p>they assume they are just not smart enough.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>C, and D, an occasional B+. but mostly Cs,</p>\n  <p>it wouldn&apos;t occur to them that teachers are looking at other classes and give the same grade.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Nor would it occur to them that statistically a certain number of students,</p>\n  <p>should have bad grades, and the teacher will make that happen as not to stick out.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And then there is the big one, the biggie,</p>\n  <p>the one that nobody talks about, that inconvenient fact.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The grades, are actually a performance score of how well the teacher is teaching,</p>\n  <p>and they have not a darn thing to do with any of the students.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You can&apos;t learn disconnected facts,</p>\n  <p>you can only temporarily memorize them.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Your grades are are reflection of how inclined you are to participate in a memorization charade,</p>\n  <p>that fetches the teacher money, and keeps your school operating.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>They have to get paid,</p>\n  <p>they have to put food on their table.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>They can&apos;t teach, because that would mean addressing every student,</p>\n  <p>that is just not possible, and they would rather get a job elsewhere.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>More importantly, they won&apos;t know, they won&apos;t even care, when you do find something that you like,</p>\n  <p>they will take that away you, because there is no time for you to learn, you have to pass tests that are in class right now.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If you don&apos;t pass the standardized tests that are an insult to your uniqueness, your predispositions, talents and creativity,</p>\n  <p>the teacher will have to be transferred to another school as a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hh6uHUx728\">lemon</a> and that makes them look bad.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>How dare you,</p>\n  <p>how dare you little child.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>They will behave high and mighty,</p>\n  <p>while selling your mind for a paycheck.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Do yo see?</p>\n  <p>do you see?</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The tests were never a judgment of you,</p>\n  <p>they are just the simplest way to track who the worst teachers are.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Everything that surrounds you in school is created with the least amount of effort,</p>\n  <p>they are using grades to make you feel bad, so that you will memorize and pretend to learn, so that everyone keeps getting paid.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>That is what the teacher wants,</p>\n  <p>put food on the table.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>They don&apos;t know what it means to get bad grades,</p>\n  <p>the fact that they are a teachers shows that they crammed, memorized and probably were proud of their meaningless grades.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It is so strange that someone solving a math problem with memorized formulas, thinks that they understand it - they don&apos;t,</p>\n  <p>they must understand how the formulas work, and it is easy and beautiful.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>To begin learning mathematics for real, you need to even out the playing field with a simple programming language,</p>\n  <p>because to quote <a href=\"https://github.com/Jam3/math-as-code\">Math As Code</a>, &quot;Mathematical symbols can mean different things depending on the author, context and the field of study (linear algebra, set theory, etc).&quot;</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>So, you aren&apos;t even learning real math,</p>\n  <p>and beyond that as you create or re-create your formulas in a simple programming language, it makes sense to plug them in, and create interactive visualizations.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And of course, before you start learning math, you need a reason to lean math, which would be creating computer games,</p>\n  <p>designing Screen Savers, Music Visualizations, Generative Art, or Generative Music, even stuff for making videos.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>More than that, you can&apos;t learn math when someone tells you to,</p>\n  <p>your mind has to be ready, and that may take a long time.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And you need to see the full picture, because as fun as Generative Art is,</p>\n  <p>you need to know why you need it...</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The reason why you need generative art,</p>\n  <p>is so that you may exhibit your works at Guggenheim, creating another product line, or helping students learn how to be more like you.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The point of it all, is to build a breathtaking portfolio,</p>\n  <p>describing a series of companies that you built.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I can&apos;t even imagine what schools must think we are,</p>\n  <p>for them to treat us the way they do, and where exactly are they directing us?</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>College, Debt and Cubicle? ... College, Brand Name University, and Lab?</p>\n  <p>And for how long, for ever? In a cubicle? Or is it until we start dreaming about opening up our own business - because we can do that as teenagers, and actually learn something for real in the process.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>We are each unique, we have different curiosities that mark natural starting points for real education,</p>\n  <p>but they will all lead to art, computers, and sciences, AND in a way that actually empowers you, makes you more powerful.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Bad grades, are just a sign that schools only care about funding,</p>\n  <p>and teachers only care about getting you to pretend to know, so that they get paid.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Bad grades are not real,</p>\n  <p>they just reveal the reality of fake education.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You are just as smart as everyone else,</p>\n  <p>and your rejection of blind memorization is a sign of and affinity for great authenticity, I&apos;ll let you discover where that will take you, on your own.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>For all the naysayers, and apologetic teachers with great excuses,</p>\n  <p>the principals, and the students with perfect grades, I understand what you are saying.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But that is not worth a single student crying her self to sleep at night,</p>\n  <p>because her grades and teachers are trying to convince her she is stupid, because she is failing your stupid make-believe schools that will lead all into debt and stress.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I honestly believe that people with bad grades,</p>\n  <p>mature faster, and are in a way gifted, but schools trick them and show them that they have no future, and sometimes this robs them of their beautiful gift.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>All the schools are not worth,</p>\n  <p>a single student crying her self to sleep.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>All of these thoughts can be easily dismissed as a conspiracy theory,</p>\n  <p>until we rephrase them as accusations of fraud.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>So,</p>\n  <p>let us ask.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Why are schools getting funding,</p>\n  <p>when graduating student do not feel that they have received a real education.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Why are grades being used on students,</p>\n  <p>when they do more damage than good.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Why is there a standard curriculum,</p>\n  <p>when everybody has different curiosities, a different pace of learning, and holds a unique constellation of knowledge.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>How can an institution refer to it self as a school,</p>\n  <p>when it causes stress that often leads to tears, and low self esteem.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Furthermore,</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Standardized schools have a tendency to convince students to spend their parents money or go into debt from overpriced college,</p>\n  <p>a paid education, with unforgivable debt, with a significant percentage of students pushed into drugs and alcohol.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The jobs that college graduates get are often less than advertised,</p>\n  <p>terrible job interviews, with bad starting salaries, and awful entry level positions.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>All of this shows signs of fraud, neglect, and lies, and more lies.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>All of this can be repaired with a Personalized Education with the Aid of Computers,</p>\n  <p>and with a focus on building small companies that will help the students to financial independence, rather than debt.</p>\n</div>",

anywhere at all.\n\nThis was early morning,\nand it is not possible to describe that early morning fragrance.\n\nIt was the middle of summer,\nand everything was blooming, everything was alive.\n\nMornings were especially thick with the scent of pine trees,\nand endless, endless deep and dark woods.\n\nI put the key in the ignition, and my power inverter cheerfully tweeted at me,\nfollowed by the GPS babbling something about a turn.\n\nHighway 31 ended, and in a split second decision, if you can call it that,\nI turned right on US 10, I was going to skip Ludington and head straight for Nordhouse.\n\nI usually take North Stiles Road, until it ends at West Townline Rd\nand then I turn left onto North Quaterline Rd.\n\nHere when I am headed straight for the wilderness,\nI turn left on West Nurnberg Rd which leads to a neat parking area.\n\nThis time I drive a little but further and did a left turn on West Forest Trail Rd,\nthis leads to a day camp area if you keep going forward where the road changes name to Porter Creek.\n\nBut I took the well manicured left turn keeping on West Forest Trail Rd,\nand took it all the way until the end passing hundreds of happy campers and fancy sites.\n\nI parked at the loop where the road ended, paid a few dollars for few days of parking my car,\nand set off for the Nordhouse Wildernes.\n\nI made it up the first hill, and sat down for a moment, a lovely couple walked by with a big dog,\nthat was proudly trotting with a very funny little-backpack on.\n\nI thought to myself, I'd be happy too if I was carrying my snacks with me,\nalas, I ate mine at the rest area, which now seemed like a terrible mistake.\n\nI waited a moment to let the couple go on ahead of me,\nso that they could have the wilderness to themselves.\n\nSlowly put my backpack on, which was heavy, with all the water,\nand went on my way.\n\nI was kind of half-heatedly looking for a nice site looking down from the top of the ancient dune,\nyou know I got to tell you, there was this unusual cool breeze which in the warm air felt like a miracle.\n\nThe smell was even more beautiful, I think if I tried to describe it,\nI would end up crying, it is the fragrance of Happy and Healthy Nature.\n\nI thought to my self if visitors from outer-space find this planet,\nmany will just end up going hiking to all the world's destinations to just sniff the woods.\n\nI switched my Audio Book from Seth Shostack's \"Search for Intelligent Life in Space\" lectures,\nto Bill Bryon's A Walk In The Woods.\n\nIt was only later that I found out that bears were re-introduced to Nordhouse,\nnow that I think about it, it was probably on top of a bunch of bears quietly living there already.\n\nIt took a few moments to actually get to the sign that indicates that,\nthis is the Nordhouse Wilderness Area,\n\nFew moments later the sites started popping up,\nyou can see patches of well worn exposed dirt where hikers or hunters camp, they are all very nice.\n\nMine ended up being the second or third, it was small and beautiful,\nbut to get there I had to descend down the ancient dune, not exactly an easy task with a heavy backpack on.\n\nI set up my tent, and took to gathering up firewood for the evening,\nespecially the chunky fallen logs which people usually can't carry as they can't chop them in pieces.\n\nI bring a sharp saw, really sharp,\nand the dry fallen logs are much easier to cut and carry.\n\nThis time people dragged a huge fallen tree into the site,\nthey were using it for sitting, so I used that for fire, and to clean up the site so that there is nothing left but dirt.\n\nNot sure what time it was but the sun was still up high,\nso I set off for a long walk down the beach.\n\nThe dunes are very beautiful studded with big old trees,\nevery-time you look you discover something different, a break in the tree line, or a sandy area where the dune parted for some reason,\n\nOr in this case an exceptionally tall stretch of dune,\nway taller than even I expected.\n\nWhen I got back from my sunny walk,\nI decided to walk the same distance, but now on the Arrowhead Trail in the woods.\n\nI almost felt guilty about the beauty that was surrounding me,\nand then I made an amazing discovery.\n\nThere was a fork in the trail that I have never noticed before,\nand the right path lead to a less worn trail that led up that gigantic dune I saw earlier.\n\nJust as I was getting comfortable with being speechless about all the beauty around me,\nthings became even more beautiful.\n\nTo get to the top of the high dune you had to climb the cutest little trail,\nthat dune could be one of the most beautiful features of Nordhouse.\n\nAnd looking towards Lake Michigan you kind of see the lake in a new light as well,\nit looks, well, more beautiful from that height as you get to see more waves, and what seems like a more distant horizon.\n\nWhen I finally made it to the highest spot,\nI checked for ants and bears, and sat down on a log, speechless.\n\nWhen I finally took it all in, I had a drink of water,\nand of all the things, my phone beeped that it had a signal.\n\nHappy with my discoveries, I begun my descent and just kept slowly walking back,\nI was going through a phase where I was re-listening to \"Electric Universe, The Shocking True Story Of Electricity.\" over and over.\n\nWhen I got to my camp, I just kept walking forward, as if it was a strangers tent down there,\nand I made it back to my car.\n\nThe amazing fact about the West Forest Trail Rd is that it's other end,\nis a gas station by a continuation of US 31, this is a whole new stretch.\n\nThe US 31 is connected by about four and a half miles of US 10,\nit is very strange, I just see them as two endings.\n\nYou don't need much when you live in the wilderness,\nsome crackers, a bit of ice cream, and a sausage.\n\nI paid for my snacks and cheerfully described to the employees my journey thus far,\nI had to hurry back it is a 10 mile drive but it is beautiful.\n\nWhen I made it back to camp, I hung up my food in the tree,\neven though in my experience there aren't any raccoons down there, and went down to m beach.\n\nI circled around waiting for the sunset, probably found a fossil or two,\nand finally sat down to watch the sun put on a show.\n\nIt got a little bit cooler almost instantly,\nI took to lighting the fire and roasting my sausage on one of the twigs I found earlier.\n\nBy the time all the stars came out I was already in my sleeping bag,\nwatching them through the netting, as I fell asleep to the Electric Universe.",

      "text": "This poem is many things; a day dream, a regular dream, a hope, a wish,\na promise, a solution and a problem, a tutorial, and a school of thinking.\n\nCome back to it if you can,\nI hope that it will always have something new to offer.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to limit how much damage a single liar can cause to a system,\nthat means computer programs should be used to structure a system.\n\nHumans will always be needed, but in a computerized automated system,\nthe amount of damage they cause can be greatly limited.\n\nOnce caught,\nthe system can be altered to prevent that attack vector from re-emerging.\n\nDo not fall into the trap of rule and inference engines,\nthey are a limited fairy tale, if they did work, they'd replace Linux.\n\nThe system architecture is simple, it is just black boxes,\nquestion in answer out.\n\nIt should be written in a language that runs in the browser,\nand on the server, so ES2020 at the time of writing.\n\nAvoid the Graphic User Interface,\nuse a Chat Interface, or a Conversational Interface.\n\nThis is what this program does,\nit answers questions.\n\nNow, this is a system that will help you launch your company,\nit will help you build a school if you are interested in such a thing,\nbut above all this is a system meant to change the world.\n\nIt must be fully accessible to every human being on this planet,\neven the 290–363 Australian Aboriginal groups that speak unique languages.\n\nTherefore, before a program is written,\nthe process must be described in a normal language that can be translated.\n\nOnce a paragraph captures a point,\na program will be written and connected to it.\n\nFor example, one may wish to ask:\n\nIs the three strike pattern in law humane?\n\nA program named \"Is the three strike pattern in law humane?\",\nwill be created, and it can be as simple as:\n\nfunction(){\nreturn {value: false, text:\"No.\"}\n}\n\nNow currently, a lot of people are under the mis-impression\nthat if someone shoplifts diapers three times...\n\nThey should lose their baby,\nand go to prison.\n\nWhere prison guards in their madness and stress,\nwill deny them feminine hygiene products\nin order to demand obedience under the 13th amendment of United States.\n\nOur simple program, will immediately cause great upset,\nyou don't need to be trying to run a small city government.\n\nThis question may come up in your first start-up, if you live in a three strike state,\nsomeone could for example have stolen and sold a laptop, and you are wondering if you should call the police.\n\nSo here, we will need another question:\n\nShould I call the Police?\nand again a program named: \"Should I call the Police?\"\n\nYou see the importance of naming a program after the question,\nif the question changes, it will become disassociated from the program, as it will have a different meaning then.\n\nfunction(){\nlet response = {value: undefined, text:\"undecided\"};\nconst numberOfOffences = await user('How many offenses does the suspect have?');\nif(numberOfOffenses = 0) response = {value: false, text:\"No. Do not cause arrest, on first offense.\"}\nif(numberOfOffenses = 1) response = {value: undefined, text:\"Use your own judgment.\"}\nif(numberOfOffenses = 2){\nif(await answer('Is the three strike pattern in law humane?')){\nresponse = {value: true, text:\"Yes, as the three strike pattern is considered humane\"};\n}else{\nresponse = {value: false, text:\"No, as the additional offense will result in imprisonment. Please handle internally.\"};\n}\n}\nreturn response;\n}\n\nSo here is a more advanced rule, that features a user call, and a sub-question.\n\nWhen you await user, the bot you are talking to will ask you a question, like Siri does,\nit will ask you a question related to your query, 'How many offenses does the suspect have?'.\n\nNotice that something amazing is happening, the computer is interfacing with you,\nit is asking you a question that it then transforms into a number and uses it in a calculation.\n\nIt didn't know something, so it used a Human, the Ghost In The Machine,\nto figure it out.\n\nLet me give you another example just to clarify,\nwhen you need help during self checkout, when something goes wrong, from the perspective of the program,\na human will be dispatched to resolve the problem.\n\nAnd one more example, The Mechanical Turk was a chess playing machine,\nthat from a perspective we need here, used a Human as a CPU.\n\nThe Human Heart will forever be more Compassionate, Creative, Loving, and Willing to Change than the best AI,\nwe are the original thinkers and out-thinkers, we will forever be best at it.\n\nIn a machine circuit as you see here, the decision making is so limited,\nand accountability so easily traceable, that if there is ever any room for corruption here, it will be easily closed.\n\nAt this point, the program prefers to do nothing if there is no offense,\nif there is one it leave it up to you, for example if that person is hateful it maybe an idea to file a second offense,\nand if they have two offenses then the program will ask it self: 'Is the three strike pattern in law humane?'\nif the answer is yes, then the person will go to prison, if the answer is no it is not humane, then you will be instructed to handle this situation internally.\n\nThese programs are meant to grow,\nperhaps even to tens of millions of lines.\n\nThey will look into things based on age,\nbased on education level, based on upbringing, and even gang involvement.\n\nMeaning that if the person that stole has been brought up in a gang neighborhood,\nthen they should not be punished, as they require therapy and un-indoctrination from the culture of taking.\n\nNow, listen to this.\n\nA Judge, who hates criminals, because they have tarnished his city,\nbecause that is what everyone else also quietly believes in his courtroom.\n\nWhen he has a bad day, he stubs his toe,\nhis coffee is cold, and all the other things fell on his head....\n\nHe is no longer impartial in the eyes of Justice,\nbut he likable in the eyes of the city.\n\nHe will now be removed from decision making,\nhe will now ask the 10 million line version of the program above, answer some questions,\nand now recommend therapy, not more abuse by prison guards and more.\n\nNow, The People, which are in charge of a company, school, city, state, nation, and Earth,\nwill be able to re-run the same calculation the District Judge did.\n\nWill be able to see a story of questions,\nand if they find some of those questions unethical, or outdated, then they will begin a social voting process,\nto change a particular line of the program.\n\nAt this point, we might as well make amnesty law more common,\nand allow those who have been incarcerated under the previous version of the system, to be set free.\n\nAs it would be unethical not to,\nthis too would be a function call, described in the system.\n\nFurthermore, elected officials would be automatically un-elected,\nwhen they cross certain lines, such as failure to meet campaign promises.\n\nAs you can see, simple programs CAN fix the corruption of a city,\nbut they require classroom upon a classroom, school upon a school to focus on their invention.\n\nThey require the participation of at least fifty million of young and inspired minds,\nthe teenagers.\n\nThe program will grow the same way World Encyclopedia Does,\nthe petitions to change rules will work the same as the Old White House Petitions.\n\nWe don't need to create a parallel system to current US law,\nnobody even know how many laws they are, and many are illogical, inconsistent, if not crazy.\n\nWe just need a system that is better than the courts,\na system that is better than at handling elections and ejections.\n\nA system that grows with us,\na system that is powered by the best in us.\n\nNot for me, not for you,\nbut for the future, because the future requires clear decision-making, and clear and inspired thinking.\n\nBegin studies of ES2020, and begin writing your first program with the use of functions,\nor maybe the Event Emitter.\n\nBuild it for your own company,\nfor a school you wished you had,\nbuild it for the city, state, nation, and the world.\n\nDon't ask what the future can do for you,\nbut what you can do for the future.\n\n\n[ES2020]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oefKzjCU4w\n[The Mechanical Turk]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Turk",

does,</p>\n  <p>it answers questions.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Now, this is a system that will help you launch your company,</p>\n  <p>it will help you build a school if you are interested in such a thing,</p>\n  <p>but above all this is a system meant to change the world.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It must be fully accessible to every human being on this planet,</p>\n  <p>even the 290&#x2013;363 Australian Aboriginal groups that speak unique languages.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Therefore, before a program is written,</p>\n  <p>the process must be described in a normal language that can be translated.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Once a paragraph captures a point,</p>\n  <p>a program will be written and connected to it.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>For example, one may wish to ask:</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Is the three strike pattern in law humane?</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>A program named &quot;Is the three strike pattern in law humane?&quot;,</p>\n  <p>will be created, and it can be as simple as:</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>function(){</p>\n  <p>return {value: false, text:&quot;No.&quot;}</p>\n  <p>}</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Now currently, a lot of people are under the mis-impression</p>\n  <p>that if someone shoplifts diapers three times...</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>They should lose their baby,</p>\n  <p>and go to prison.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Where prison guards in their madness and stress,</p>\n  <p>will deny them feminine hygiene products</p>\n  <p>in order to demand obedience under the 13th amendment of United States.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Our simple program, will immediately cause great upset,</p>\n  <p>you don&apos;t need to be trying to run a small city government.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>This question may come up in your first start-up, if you live in a three strike state,</p>\n  <p>someone could for example have stolen and sold a laptop, and you are wondering if you should call the police.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>So here, we will need another question:</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Should I call the Police?</p>\n  <p>and again a program named: &quot;Should I call the Police?&quot;</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You see the importance of naming a program after the question,</p>\n  <p>if the question changes, it will become disassociated from the program, as it will have a different meaning then.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>function(){</p>\n  <p>let response = {value: undefined, text:&quot;undecided&quot;};</p>\n  <p>const numberOfOffences = await user(&apos;How many offenses does the suspect have?&apos;);</p>\n  <p>if(numberOfOffenses = 0) response = {value: false, text:&quot;No. Do not cause arrest, on first offense.&quot;}</p>\n  <p>if(numberOfOffenses = 1) response = {value: undefined, text:&quot;Use your own judgment.&quot;}</p>\n  <p>if(numberOfOffenses = 2){</p>\n  <p>if(await answer(&apos;Is the three strike pattern in law humane?&apos;)){</p>\n  <p>response = {value: true, text:&quot;Yes, as the three strike pattern is considered humane&quot;};</p>\n  <p>}else{</p>\n  <p>response = {value: false, text:&quot;No, as the additional offense will result in imprisonment. Please handle internally.&quot;};</p>\n  <p>}</p>\n  <p>}</p>\n  <p>return response;</p>\n  <p>}</p>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>So here is a more advanced rule, that features a user call, and a sub-question.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>When you await user, the bot you are talking to will ask you a question, like Siri does,</p>\n  <p>it will ask you a question related to your query, &apos;How many offenses does the suspect have?&apos;.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Notice that something amazing is happening, the computer is interfacing with you,</p>\n  <p>it is asking you a question that it then transforms into a number and uses it in a calculation.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It didn&apos;t know something, so it used a Human, the Ghost In The Machine,</p>\n  <p>to figure it out.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Let me give you another example just to clarify,</p>\n  <p>when you need help during self checkout, when something goes wrong, from the perspective of the program,</p>\n  <p>a human will be dispatched to resolve the problem.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And one more example, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Turk\">The Mechanical Turk</a> was a chess playing machine,</p>\n  <p>that from a perspective we need here, used a Human as a CPU.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The Human Heart will forever be more Compassionate, Creative, Loving, and Willing to Change than the best AI,</p>\n  <p>we are the original thinkers and out-thinkers, we will forever be best at it.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In a machine circuit as you see here, the decision making is so limited,</p>\n  <p>and accountability so easily traceable, that if there is ever any room for corruption here, it will be easily closed.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>At this point, the program prefers to do nothing if there is no offense,</p>\n  <p>if there is one it leave it up to you, for example if that person is hateful it maybe an idea to file a second offense,</p>\n  <p>and if they have two offenses then the program will ask it self: &apos;Is the three strike pattern in law humane?&apos;</p>\n  <p>if the answer is yes, then the person will go to prison, if the answer is no it is not humane, then you will be instructed to handle this situation internally.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>These programs are meant to grow,</p>\n  <p>perhaps even to tens of millions of lines.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>They will look into things based on age,</p>\n  <p>based on education level, based on upbringing, and even gang involvement.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Meaning that if the person that stole has been brought up in a gang neighborhood,</p>\n  <p>then they should not be punished, as they require therapy and un-indoctrination from the culture of taking.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Now, listen to this.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>A Judge, who hates criminals, because they have tarnished his city,</p>\n  <p>because that is what everyone else also quietly believes in his courtroom.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>When he has a bad day, he stubs his toe,</p>\n  <p>his coffee is cold, and all the other things fell on his head....</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>He is no longer impartial in the eyes of Justice,</p>\n  <p>but he likable in the eyes of the city.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>He will now be removed from decision making,</p>\n  <p>he will now ask the 10 million line version of the program above, answer some questions,</p>\n  <p>and now recommend therapy, not more abuse by prison guards and more.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Now, The People, which are in charge of a company, school, city, state, nation, and Earth,</p>\n  <p>will be able to re-run the same calculation the District Judge did.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Will be able to see a story of questions,</p>\n  <p>and if they find some of those questions unethical, or outdated, then they will begin a social voting process,</p>\n  <p>to change a particular line of the program.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>At this point, we might as well make amnesty law more common,</p>\n  <p>and allow those who have been incarcerated under the previous version of the system, to be set free.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>As it would be unethical not to,</p>\n  <p>this too would be a function call, described in the system.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Furthermore, elected officials would be automatically un-elected,</p>\n  <p>when they cross certain lines, such as failure to meet campaign promises.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>As you can see, simple programs CAN fix the corruption of a city,</p>\n  <p>but they require classroom upon a classroom, school upon a school to focus on their invention.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>They require the participation of at least fifty million of young and inspired minds,</p>\n  <p>the teenagers.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The program will grow the same way World Encyclopedia Does,</p>\n  <p>the petitions to change rules will work the same as the Old White House Petitions.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>We don&apos;t need to create a parallel system to current US law,</p>\n  <p>nobody even know how many laws they are, and many are illogical, inconsistent, if not crazy.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>We just need a system that is better than the courts,</p>\n  <p>a system that is better than at handling elections and ejections.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>A system that grows with us,</p>\n  <p>a system that is powered by the best in us.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Not for me, not for you,</p>\n  <p>but for the future, because the future requires clear decision-making, and clear and inspired thinking.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Begin studies of ES2020, and begin writing your first program with the use of functions,</p>\n  <p>or maybe the Event Emitter.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Build it for your own company,</p>\n  <p>for a school you wished you had,</p>\n  <p>build it for the city, state, nation, and the world.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Don&apos;t ask what the future can do for you,</p>\n  <p>but what you can do for the future.</p>\n</div>",

      "text": "Above all, begin paying attention to your mental well being,\nwhatever is causing you harm, get away from it.\n\nIf you think you can't get away from it,\nthen find a relative that will take you in.\n\nIf you don't have relatives,\nthen you will have to talk to your best friend's parents.\n\nYou can't stay in a place that is stressing you out,\nyou need a place that is safe, a place where you can think.\n\nAnd then begin thinking about building a company,\nor a tiny business, at first just for learning.\n\nEveryone says it is not easy,\npeople say they get burned out, overworked.\n\nBut that is the wrong approach,\nyou need to be whole.\n\nThere is a little passage in the Ranger Creed,\nthat nobly emphasizes just that.\n\n\"Never shall I fail my comrades. I will always keep myself mentally alert, physically strong and morally straight and I will shoulder more than my share of the task whatever it may be, one-hundred-percent and then some.\n\nMentally alert means, you take care of your mind,\nthat you are rested, that you are free.\n\nDo not let mediocrity, liars, cheaters, pretenders hurt your mind,\nyou have to be mentally alert, mentally well enough to easily go above and beyond.\n\nPlease allow me to make a note here, I'll make it brief,\npeople are stressed out by fake education, more and more drugs are becoming accessible.\n\nFurthermore, there maybe schools that in their evil will attempt to diagnose people with states of mind that woudn't exist,\nif it wasn't for the insanity of school.\n\nSir Ken Robinson, called unusually high number of prescriptions for ADHD a sign of a \"A Fictitious Epidemic\",\nand fake schools will cause depression in a healthy mind, that is how it works,\n\nIf schools start medicating the kids they depressed,\nthen even if you want school, get out, get out as fast as you can.\n\nAnd remember liars are never obvious,\nliars always live in the twilight, there will be no proof, no evidence, just better grades and better profits.\n\nBe careful,\nit is that kind of a world, I am sorry.\n\nMental Well Being, is Number One,\nnumber two, is somewhat related, especially if you are in middle school or high school.\n\nThe first thing you need is an upgrade on you view of the world,\nthe way you inherit a more sophisticated intellectual culture is Audio Books.\n\nThey are not free,\nthey should be free for people under 21.\n\nThere is no one book, it will take over a hundred Audio Books,\n- and you know this, this one is not easy.\n\nWith a hundred books, you will create a self-balancing view of the world,\nand in the process inherit character traits from many of your favorite authors.\n\nIntellectual Inheritance,\nis just another way of saying growing up by reading books.\n\nThis is one of the reasons why you need a safe place, a safe space,\nso that you may grow up, uninterrupted by things that are not worthy of you.\n\nThere is one sure way to accelerate your intellectual growth,\nbut you need three more friends, at least, and you need to be in your 20s or up.\n\nAn that is taking to the trails,\ndon't do this alone, please.\n\nIn United States we have The Appalachian Trail,\nand The Pacific Crest Trail.\n\nBring your Audiobooks, Bear Spray, and an Air Horn (bears don't like loud sounds),\nespecially if it is four horns going off at the same time.\n\nIgnore people that say you don't need the horn,\njust activate it until they walk away.\n\nBring your journal,\nand grow.\n\nThe biggest problems you face when you are young,\nis a smaller grasp of self awareness.\n\nThis is a function of our brain still growing,\nand the genetic predispositions to follow orders, to follow what your teachers tell you for example.\n\nYou are also building a view of the world,\nand stuff that isn't real is polluting it.\n\nSo, schools are forcing you into memorization, and each semester you have little to show for it,\nespecially if you ask yourself: \"What if I just spent five months learning how to use a Digital Audio Workstation?\"\n\nYou would be able to compose music, probably in just a week,\nby the fifth month you would be publishing your second album on bandcamp, and with some advertising, you could make probably more than a $100 a month.\n\nEven so, you tell yourself, schools are important,\nI need schools, because schools get me to college, and perhaps med school.\n\nYou probably don't go as far as pondering the $241,600 average unforgivable student loan debt,\nbecause you can just pay it off after you get the job.\n\nThis is why you need a hundred of those Audio Books,\nif you want to be a doctor, then in your first hundred books ten will be about becoming one, and a couple about the regrets.\n\nBut it is more than just shining light on your career,\nit is about shining light on the way you make choices.\n\nYou can't jump forward,\nyou have to move precisely deliberately.\n\nYou have to start in High School to be a Doctor,\nyou have to love it, it has to call to you, you may do part time at a veterinary clinic, and maybe work at a retirement home.\n\nJust waiting for Med School to make you a Doctor is not enough,\nyou have to love making your way there, it has to inspire you, fuel you, it has to make you happy.\n\nSelf awareness means that you know where you are,\nand you know a clear and stable path towards the future.\n\nIn terms of becoming a Doctor, everything that is covered in the first two years of med school,\nyou have to cover on your own in the first two years of high school, just as a function of curiosity.\n\nSomething in you has to ask, what is MCAT and MLE about... anyways?\nand then you go shopping for a microscope, and might as well pick up a stethoscope and take interest in the heath of your gerbil, or cat.\n\nIn other words, in terms of becoming a Doctor, memorization is required,\neven though it is not effective, and pretty stupid.\n\nAnd if you take to using what you memorized without double checking,\nthen you will get in trouble.\n\nJust as a side-note, the right way of doing this,\nis not to memorize, but to love so many things about the field that you immediately absorb new information.\n\nSometimes with tears in your eyes as you deep down know you made a huge breakthrough,\nwhich means you don't need to memorize it, and will never forget it.\n\nAnd sometimes with passionate anger, at all the idiots that made it too confusing,\nbecause they clearly didn't know what they were taking about.\n\nIn terms of a more open future,\nwhere we just say to ourselves I'll just get a good job after I graduate college.\n\nIt is a different story, because now you are looking at $32,000 to $50,000 in debt,\nand memorizing things that you will forget when you start your job.\n\nYou know when Police stops you, and ask you \"Do you know what you did wrong?\",\nto get you to admit to whatever it is, to make their job easier, and a fool out of you.\n\nJobs do the same thing they will say Entry Position, Experience Required,\nso that during the interview, they can say \"we can't pay you that much, because you do not have the experience we asked for\".\n\nIn this situation, Self Awareness translates to asking:\n\"do I want to work for such a company?\"\n\nDo you want to work for a company,\nthat is already trying to take advantage of you.\n\nAfter four years of high school and four years of college,\nand with $32,000 to $50,000 of unforgivable debt, plus your credit cards, and other tricks.\n\nYou are now being insulted,\non your happy interview day.\n\nYou need to consider this,\nand you need to consider what it is like to work in a cubicle for the rest of your life.\n\nNot only are you looking at eight years of school,\nbut about 80 years of working in a box, or worse an open space where you can hear all the moth breathers.\n\nSelf awareness means intercepting mistakes before they happen,\nagain only renowned Audio Books by good narrators, written by highly respected and loved authors will help you with this.\n\nAt least a hundred books,\nthere is a video of Stanford Commencement Address that Steve Jobs gave in 2005, that you may wish to see.\n\nDespite what Mr. Jobs says about the dots,\nyou can connect them, it is the job of you increasing your self awareness with books to connect them.\n\nYou do not go forward into the future merely trusting your gut, or destiny, life, karma, whatever,\nbecause the world is full of people that will take advantage of that blind expectation.\n\nSo you absolutely need to take care of your mental well being,\nand expansion of your self awareness by listening to dozens and dozens of audio books highly valued by their readers.\n\nEven by just watching how Steve Jobs carries him self,\nhow he talks about college tuition, he is gently and in very classy way pealing apart that fraud.\n\nIt is the first and foremost thing he brings up,\nbecause he refuses to be a part of it.\n\nTo name a few of my most influential figures:\n\nSir Ken Robinson\nAstra Taylor\nBill Bryson\nRichard Dawkins\nSam Harris\nPZ Myers\nLawrence Krauss\nLord Martin Rees\nJill Tarter\nSeth Shostak\nAlex Filippenko\nSean Carroll\nJared Diamond\nHoward Zinn\nBrené Brown\nAyaan Hirsi Ali\nDaniel Dennett\nChristopher Hitchens\nNoam Chomsky\n\nThere is this one talk by Richard Dawkins that I really like,\nthere is a video titled \"Richard Dawkins - The God Delusion Q&A at Liberty University\"\n\nLiberty University (LU) is a private evangelical Christian university in Lynchburg, Virginia,\nthat Q&A was destined for greatness.\n\nA young lady poses a question \"What if you're wrong?\",\nand this is my private opinion: I think she was aiming at Pascal's Wager, but Richard Dawkins response was a lot more elaborate than shooting fish in a barrel.\n\nSearch the internet for a video entitled \"PHILOSOPHY - Religion: Pascal's Wager\" for more information on Pascal's Wager,\nwhich also includes a bespectacled cartoon kitty named Richard Pawkins.\n\nAnd between you and I the gambit it shutdown with an argument for authenticity,\nif someone believes something purely for personal gain then they can't be invited to a serious discussion.\n\nBut the Pascal's Wager interpretation of what this humble young lady is asking about, is just my personal opinion,\nand Richard Dawkins takes it his own way.\n\nWhich resulted in a wonderfully animated Richard Dawkins in a South Park cartoon,\nI love that little smile of accomplishment at the end, but more than that, I love the audience.\n\nThe sound of the Audience at Liberty University,\ntells me that we are still headed for the Stars.\n\nBut again the reason I bring this up in no uncertain terms is:\nInheritance of Class, and Culture, and expansion of our awareness of the world, and how we fit in it.\n\nJust observing the way that Richard Dawkins carries him self,\nand hearing the cheer and laughter by all the wonderful people in the audience, helped me expand my personal vision of the world.\n\nHere is another side of Richard Dawkins, and even more giggles,\na two part Extravaganza.\n\nPart one \"Hate E-mails with Richard Dawkins\",\nand the second batch \"Love Letters to Richard Dawkins\".\n\nSearch internet videos for Richard Dawkins in 1991 presenting Growing Up in the Universe, a series of five lectures,\nheld at the Royal Institution in London.\n\nRoyal Institution Christmas Lectures are a great tradition and a great honor,\nhere scientists present science in a way that opens doors for those who are new to science.\n\nHe also created an hour and a half long documentary,\nentitled The God Delusion, you can really see what it means to be a great being, and hope to help the word progress forward.\n\nRichard Dawkins is one of many people\nwho will help you with your awareness..\n\nWhen you are stuck, cramming for tests, you can ask what would Richard do,\nwould he sit here pretending to get educated, would he try to change schools, talk to the principal, or give a set of banned lectures on how the school only cares that everyone gets paid.\n\nAnd if you are into science,\nI hope you have a day dream about presenting you science of choice at the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures someday.\n\nNumber one, is Mental Well Being,\nnumber two, is view of the world, the view of yourself in relation to our world, and class, and foresight.\n\nAnd number three, is business,\nwe all have different interests.\n\nIt is tough to give general business advice,\nbut; setting up a laboratory where you tutor med students helping them see through a microscope or visualization what they are attempting to blindly memorize.\n\nIf you are inclined towards science, then programming languages can be used as a kind of a microscope,\nyou can examine any complex system or theory by writing a tiny simulation, or implementation.\n\nIf you are not sure where you are headed, then begin writing a Science Journal, let other scientist publish or peer review,\nand you can stay in the field without having to work 26 hour shifts for $300, remember number 1, your well being is most important.\n\nAway from the laboratories, in my private opinion is where the party is,\nunconstrained by any field in particular you can do, everything.\n\nFor one, 3D printing is awesome, and you can find it as a service online too,\nyou can sculpt in clay 3D scan it and then miniaturize them and open up a little jewelry store on Shapeways.\n\nYou can open up a First Person View Drone Racing circuit,\nand perhaps have a yearly competition for automatically operated drones only.\n\nWith an Office Projector and some Plywood Sheathing you can begin painting 8ft murals,\nfollow the Old Masters, create the gray version of your painting first, and then add color glaze to achieve perfect portrait every time.\n\nRemember, to desaturate a color you mix it with the opposite on the color wheel,\nthere is an exception for the primaries, you mix the full triad, secondary colors already consist of two colors, so you just add the opposite, and that makes the triad.\n\nAs with Science, you must be lead by you passion,\neverything you do has to be inspired.\n\nWhen you are inspired, you are driven by enough information,\nto have no need for memorization, you simply integrate the new to the great library within you.\n\nWhile I can't show you the direction you must move towards to create your business,\nthere is a guiding idea that will help you along.\n\nA self published, full color book,\nthat serves as your portfolio.\n\nIt will contain your design sketches,\nand photographs of your complete work.\n\nThis will help you get clients,\nor get hired by a large company.\n\nI think Eiko Ishioka the costume designer behind Bram Stoker's Dracula, is a perfect example of an Artist and an Entrepreneur,\nshe published her costume designs in a beautiful book and got hired to work on Dracula, and won the 1993 Oscar for it.\n\nIn closing,\nyour mental well being must come first, and then you have to grow, as soon as you are ready to expand your horizons, read, listen, explore.\n\nBegin making your way into the cultures of great beings,\nby reading their books, by admiring their works, by learning from them.\n\nSchools will forever be a prosthetic,\neven if they do transform into a personalized education experience.\n\nYou need to pursue an independent plan,\non top of everything else that is going on, because only you can guarantee your won future, it has always been in your own hands.\n\nAnd never forget,\nyou are meant to be come a great being, do not let anyone stop you.\n\n\n[A Fictitious Epidemic]:

I will always keep myself mentally alert, physically strong and morally straight and I will shoulder more than my share of the task whatever it may be, one-hundred-percent and then some.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Mentally alert means, you take care of your mind,</p>\n  <p>that you are rested, that you are free.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Do not let mediocrity, liars, cheaters, pretenders hurt your mind,</p>\n  <p>you have to be mentally alert, mentally well enough to easily go above and beyond.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Please allow me to make a note here, I&apos;ll make it brief,</p>\n  <p>people are stressed out by fake education, more and more drugs are becoming accessible.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Furthermore, there maybe schools that in their evil will attempt to diagnose people with states of mind that woudn&apos;t exist,</p>\n  <p>if it wasn&apos;t for the insanity of school.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Sir Ken Robinson, called unusually high number of prescriptions for ADHD a sign of a &quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCbdS4hSa0s&amp;t=2195\">A Fictitious Epidemic</a>&quot;,</p>\n  <p>and fake schools will cause depression in a healthy mind, that is how it works,</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If schools start medicating the kids they depressed,</p>\n  <p>then even if you want school, get out, get out as fast as you can.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And remember liars are never obvious,</p>\n  <p>liars always live in the twilight, there will be no proof, no evidence, just better grades and better profits.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Be careful,</p>\n  <p>it is that kind of a world, I am sorry.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Mental Well Being, is Number One,</p>\n  <p>number two, is somewhat related, especially if you are in middle school or high school.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The first thing you need is an upgrade on you view of the world,</p>\n  <p>the way you inherit a more sophisticated intellectual culture is Audio Books.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>They are not free,</p>\n  <p>they should be free for people under 21.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>There is no one book, it will take over a hundred Audio Books,</p>\n  <p>- and you know this, this one is not easy.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>With a hundred books, you will create a self-balancing view of the world,</p>\n  <p>and in the process inherit character traits from many of your favorite authors.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Intellectual Inheritance,</p>\n  <p>is just another way of saying growing up by reading books.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>This is one of the reasons why you need a safe place, a safe space,</p>\n  <p>so that you may grow up, uninterrupted by things that are not worthy of you.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>There is one sure way to accelerate your intellectual growth,</p>\n  <p>but you need three more friends, at least, and you need to be in your 20s or up.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>An that is taking to the trails,</p>\n  <p>don&apos;t do this alone, please.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In United States we have The Appalachian Trail,</p>\n  <p>and The Pacific Crest Trail.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Bring your Audiobooks, Bear Spray, and an Air Horn (bears don&apos;t like loud sounds),</p>\n  <p>especially if it is four horns going off at the same time.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Ignore people that say you don&apos;t need the horn,</p>\n  <p>just activate it until they walk away.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Bring your journal,</p>\n  <p>and grow.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The biggest problems you face when you are young,</p>\n  <p>is a smaller grasp of self awareness.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>This is a function of our brain still growing,</p>\n  <p>and the genetic predispositions to follow orders, to follow what your teachers tell you for example.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You are also building a view of the world,</p>\n  <p>and stuff that isn&apos;t real is polluting it.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>So, schools are forcing you into memorization, and each semester you have little to show for it,</p>\n  <p>especially if you ask yourself: &quot;What if I just spent five months learning how to use a Digital Audio Workstation?&quot;</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You would be able to compose music, probably in just a week,</p>\n  <p>by the fifth month you would be publishing your second album on bandcamp, and with some advertising, you could make probably more than a $100 a month.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Even so, you tell yourself, schools are important,</p>\n  <p>I need schools, because schools get me to college, and perhaps med school.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You probably don&apos;t go as far as pondering the $241,600 average unforgivable student loan debt,</p>\n  <p>because you can just pay it off after you get the job.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>This is why you need a hundred of those Audio Books,</p>\n  <p>if you want to be a doctor, then in your first hundred books ten will be about becoming one, and a couple about the regrets.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But it is more than just shining light on your career,</p>\n  <p>it is about shining light on the way you make choices.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You can&apos;t jump forward,</p>\n  <p>you have to move precisely deliberately.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You have to start in High School to be a Doctor,</p>\n  <p>you have to love it, it has to call to you, you may do part time at a veterinary clinic, and maybe work at a retirement home.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Just waiting for Med School to make you a Doctor is not enough,</p>\n  <p>you have to love making your way there, it has to inspire you, fuel you, it has to make you happy.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Self awareness means that you know where you are,</p>\n  <p>and you know a clear and stable path towards the future.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In terms of becoming a Doctor, everything that is covered in the first two years of med school,</p>\n  <p>you have to cover on your own in the first two years of high school, just as a function of curiosity.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Something in you has to ask, what is MCAT and MLE about... anyways?</p>\n  <p>and then you go shopping for a microscope, and might as well pick up a stethoscope and take interest in the heath of your gerbil, or cat.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In other words, in terms of becoming a Doctor, memorization is required,</p>\n  <p>even though it is not effective, and pretty stupid.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And if you take to using what you memorized without double checking,</p>\n  <p>then you will get in trouble.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Just as a side-note, the right way of doing this,</p>\n  <p>is not to memorize, but to love so many things about the field that you immediately absorb new information.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Sometimes with tears in your eyes as you deep down know you made a huge breakthrough,</p>\n  <p>which means you don&apos;t need to memorize it, and will never forget it.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And

&quot;What if you&apos;re wrong?&quot;,</p>\n  <p>and this is my private opinion: I think she was aiming at Pascal&apos;s Wager, but Richard Dawkins response was a lot more elaborate than shooting fish in a barrel.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Search the internet for a video entitled &quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F_LUFIeUk0\">PHILOSOPHY - Religion: Pascal&apos;s Wager</a>&quot; for more information on Pascal&apos;s Wager,</p>\n  <p>which also includes a bespectacled cartoon kitty named Richard Pawkins.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And between you and I the gambit it shutdown with an argument for authenticity,</p>\n  <p>if someone believes something purely for personal gain then they can&apos;t be invited to a serious discussion.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But the Pascal&apos;s Wager interpretation of what this humble young lady is asking about, is just my personal opinion,</p>\n  <p>and Richard Dawkins takes it his own way.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Which resulted in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPJQw-x-xho\">wonderfully animated Richard Dawkins in a South Park cartoon</a>,</p>\n  <p>I love that little smile of accomplishment at the end, but more than that, I love the audience.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The sound of the Audience at Liberty University,</p>\n  <p>tells me that we are still headed for the Stars.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But again the reason I bring this up in no uncertain terms is:</p>\n  <p>Inheritance of Class, and Culture, and expansion of our awareness of the world, and how we fit in it.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Just observing the way that Richard Dawkins carries him self,</p>\n  <p>and hearing the cheer and laughter by all the wonderful people in the audience, helped me expand my personal vision of the world.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Here is another side of Richard Dawkins, and even more giggles,</p>\n  <p>a two part Extravaganza.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Part one &quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhYT4vE1gvM\">Hate E-mails with Richard Dawkins</a>&quot;,</p>\n  <p>and the second batch &quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gW7607YiBso\">Love Letters to Richard Dawkins</a>&quot;.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Search internet videos for Richard Dawkins in 1991 presenting <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHoxZF3ZgTo&amp;list=PLKSmsr0k7vdmpD-ABiNeiXiy9_XwXf5bC\">Growing Up in the Universe</a>, a series of five lectures,</p>\n  <p>held at the Royal Institution in London.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Institution_Christmas_Lectures\">Royal Institution Christmas Lectures</a> are a great tradition and a great honor,</p>\n  <p>here scientists present science in a way that opens doors for those who are new to science.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>He also created an hour and a half long documentary,</p>\n  <p>entitled <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzZh2wstj88\" title=\"Richard Dawkins&apos; The God Delusion, Full Documentary\">The God Delusion</a>, you can really see what it means to be a great being, and hope to help the word progress forward.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Richard Dawkins is one of many people</p>\n  <p>who will help you with your awareness..</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>When you are stuck, cramming for tests, you can ask what would Richard do,</p>\n  <p>would he sit here pretending to get educated, would he try to change schools, talk to the principal, or give a set of banned lectures on how the school only cares that everyone gets paid.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And if you are into science,</p>\n  <p>I hope you have a day dream about presenting you science of choice at the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures someday.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Number one, is Mental Well Being,</p>\n  <p>number two, is view of the world, the view of yourself in relation to our world, and class, and foresight.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And number three, is business,</p>\n  <p>we all have different interests.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It is tough to give general business advice,</p>\n  <p>but; setting up a laboratory where you tutor med students helping them see through a microscope or visualization what they are attempting to blindly memorize.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If you are inclined towards science, then programming languages can be used as a kind of a microscope,</p>\n  <p>you can examine any complex system or theory by writing a tiny simulation, or implementation.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If you are not sure where you are headed, then begin writing a Science Journal, let other scientist publish or peer review,</p>\n  <p>and you can stay in the field without having to work 26 hour shifts for $300, remember number 1, your well being is most important.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Away from the laboratories, in my private opinion is where the party is,</p>\n  <p>unconstrained by any field in particular you can do, everything.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>For one, 3D printing is awesome, and you can find it as a service online too,</p>\n  <p>you can sculpt in clay 3D scan it and then miniaturize them and open up a little jewelry store on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTZBjj010XA\">Shapeways</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You can open up a First Person View <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR4Gq9qfpnM\">Drone Racing circuit</a>,</p>\n  <p>and perhaps have a yearly competition for automatically operated drones only.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.homedepot.com/b/Lumber-Composites-Plywood-Sheathing-Plywood/N-5yc1vZc7q5\">With an Office Projector and some Plywood Sheathing you can begin painting 8ft murals</a>,</p>\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK4Uo5QvH6M\">follow the Old Masters</a>, create the gray version of your painting first, and then add color glaze to achieve perfect portrait every time.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Remember, to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuslLjXba9I\">desaturate a color you mix it with the opposite on the color wheel</a>,</p>\n  <p>there is an exception for the primaries, you mix the full triad, secondary colors already consist of two colors, so you just add the opposite, and that makes the triad.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>As with Science, you must be lead by you passion,</p>\n  <p>everything you do has to be inspired.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>When you are inspired, you are driven by enough information,</p>\n  <p>to have no need for memorization, you simply integrate the new to the great library within you.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>While I can&apos;t show you the direction you must move towards to create your business,</p>\n  <p>there is a guiding idea that will help you along.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>A self published, full color book,</p>\n  <p>that serves as your portfolio.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It will contain your design sketches,</p>\n  <p>and photographs of your complete work.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>This will help you get clients,</p>\n  <p>or get hired by a large company.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I think <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLmsPklCJSY\">Eiko Ishioka</a> the costume designer behind Bram Stoker&apos;s Dracula, is a perfect example of an Artist and an Entrepreneur,</p>\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_smVQFEMops\">she published her costume designs in a beautiful book</a> and got hired to work on Dracula, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmjRRNnY-YA\">won the 1993 Oscar for it</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In closing,</p>\n  <p>your mental well being must come first, and then you have to grow, as soon as you are ready to expand your horizons, read, listen, explore.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Begin making your way into the cultures of great beings,</p>\n  <p>by reading their books, by admiring their works, by learning from them.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Schools will forever be a prosthetic,</p>\n  <p>even if they do transform into a personalized education experience.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You need to pursue an independent plan,</p>\n  <p>on top of everything else that is going on, because only you can guarantee your won future, it has always been in your own hands.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And never forget,</p>\n  <p>you are meant to be come a great being, do not let anyone stop you.</p>\n</div>",

that's why they sit there silently.\n\nReal education,\nis a massive superpower, an insight into the entire universe.\n\nIt starts with a stick in the ground,\nas you watch the way the shadow moves around it throughout the day.\n\nAnd try to re-create the geometry necessary,\nto simulate the same motion, with what slowly builds as an unstoppable urge to learn math.\n\nIt starts with a sea shell,\nthat has a strange repeating pattern that you noticed in a young unfolding fern.\n\nThe Golden Ratio is too similar in too many things,\nand before you know it, you are looking beneath the fractals to discover chaos in unexpected places.\n\nIt starts with a hole in your curtain,\nthe pinhole camera reverses the image, the light scatters when it hits a glass of water.\n\nIt scatters differently for different things,\nthe secrets of the universe unravel.\n\nIt starts with a glimpse of a computer screen,\nsomething about those graphics catches your attention.\n\nThe game is playing it self,\nin a virtual world, where you can simulate interaction, a game theory.\n\nIt starts with a strange song and UFO sounds,\nthat seems robotic and automatic like it is a computer program.\n\nAnd now you are live coding music,\nsearching for patterns in the frequencies that satisfy our ears.\n\nIt does not start with,\n\"Please open your books on another worthless page\".\n\nIt does not start with,\n\"Please take out a piece of paper, we have a quiz today.\"\n\nIt does not start with,\n\"Why are you failing this class!?\"\n\nNo,\nthat is how it ends.\n\nWe have a problem with all to easy following orders,\nespecially when we are young.\n\nWe are not equipped to handle broken schools,\nbroken promises, schools that have above all become a place of moneymaking, not teaching.\n\nOnce you are old enough to see the fraud,\nthere is nothing you can do to go back to middle school, or high school to fix it.\n\nThe only way to win,\nis not to play.\n\nTo learn you need a happy and safe space,\nwhere you are allowed to explore and follow your own curiosities.\n\nRather than a diploma, you need a beautiful portfolio documenting your inventions,\nand all the companies you build along the way.\n\nBeing stressed, threatened with debt, or punished with grades, insane teachers, or bullies,\nis pretty much a definition of how you don't learn.\n\nAnd working within this broken system by cramming,\nis not an achievement - it is something else.\n\nThe years that you transform from LEGO to Raspberry PI, and a Business Person,\nand actually enjoy learning about Computers, Math, Science, Music....\n\nAre stolen from you, by stress, fraud, broken promises, and sick teachers,\nunder a threat that you can't get anywhere without a diploma.\n\nBut, the truth is you can't get anywhere without a real education,\npeople know that schools are fake.\n\nHigh School diplomas are laughed at, and college is beginning to be perceived as,\nnot for learning, but for having fun with people your age, and to prove you can do you chores (like a little child).\n\nThe right way to face life,\nis to find ways to lean for real.\n\nThe fraud of education is so powerful,\nthat that even those of us who stand up against it still return for that worthless diploma.\n\nThe facts are, that everyone knows schools are not working,\nand lemons are a rule, not an exception.\n\nThat is an enormous threat to your future,\nno matter what happens, you still need to read and comprehend hundreds and hundreds of books.\n\nYou need to know Science for real, you need to know how to program commuters,\nhow to express your inner desires with art and music.\n\nAnd how to at-least stop being scared of poverty,\nyou need to start learning how to run small businesses, and you need to start inventing real inventions, and asking real questions.\n\nEven if what you invent is a somewhat large MP3 player,\nit is still a monumental invention.\n\nYour enclosures, the Bluetooth antenna,\nthe batteries, the SBC, or the version of the Raspberry PI Zero you choose.\n\nTeachers you mathematics, soldering, programming, science,\nLinux, Bash, Python.\n\nAnd the way you build your website,\nthe way you present your product, or kit, or the bone conducting underwater version...\n\nWill help you to, marketing, payment processing,\nadvertising, HTML and CSS, and JavaScript, React, Vue, and Svelte.\n\nAll your tutorials, from soldering to recharging with solar,\nor wirelessly connecting to the server inside to look at stats -

      "text": "Nobody cared about the old Bulletin Board Systems,\nand not all the people cared about Zak McKracken, or later on Wolfenstein 3D.\n\nThe old computer dreams are good dreams,\nfinely crafted expert systems for one were clearly going to change the world.\n\nAn expert system does basic logic,\nbut a finely made one, can actually help us reason about complex issues.\n\nThe AI we know today is drenched in chaos,\nit is just statistics done right.\n\nThe expert systems, are, tools for us, based on our needs,\na way of encoding legal systems.\n\nThe Mechanical Turk, or as I call it The Ghost In The Machine,\nare a way for all human beings on earth to make money.\n\nMUD, is actually the tool we need to create intelligence,\nit will still rely on statistics, but not blindly.\n\nIt would take a life time for one person to craft a world\nwhere dreams and observations, would combine to create sanity.\n\nLike with all computer programs, garbage in garbage out,\nthe virtual world to fuel the real AI, must be finely crafted by a human mind.\n\nOur minds are crafted by a different processes,\none that involves a lot of accidents.\n\nAnd cherry on top,\nwe are here because accidents come together just right and emerge a civilization,\nthat can ask \"why are we here?\", and we are proof of that.\n\nWe have to make use of computers the right way,\nwe need legal systems that rely on expert systems.\n\nSimulations will likely reveal,\nthat there is certain limit to how many laws are too many and ruin a system.\n\nSimulations will also reveal that we can't fix cities,\nby sentencing people to poverty and fracturing them into a desperate life of crime.\n\nWhen I say, \"We are all very smart\", I mean it,\nbut we also need a real education, a fake education can only add to poverty.\n\nA city that continues fracturing minds with poverty and fake education,\nand then sending them to prisons, and making it so that they can't get a job afterwards...\n\nIs not a city yet,\nit is still just a hope of one.\n\nUniversal Basic Income,\nis a good transition idea.\n\nBut then businesses specifically crafted,\nfor taking that money will emerge.\n\nWe see a model that they can potentially adopt with student debt,\nunforgivable debt, no bankruptcy is big enough to wipe it.\n\nWe'll just see businesses offering more free money,\nto take a cut of that free income.\n\nAnd we can't possibly exclude anybody,\nnot in prison, not in hospital.\n\nNow that people with debt are going to be receiving free money,\nthose checks will be intercepted by debt collection agencies, which as you can imagine are going to spring to life.\n\nAnd Universal doesn't mean national,\nit means world wide.\n\nAfter all,\nwe need not create anymore inequality.\n\nWe have seen the emergence of special debt,\nthe unforgivable student debt.\n\nNow we will need to see the emergence of a new kind of money,\none that can only be spent by the owner, on what the owner wishes, not what she is forced to spend on...\n\nBut what she chooses to spend it on,\nthis is far beyond the thinking of any congress.\n\nBut it is trivial for a computer system to process another kind of currency,\nI say we give it a name right now, before someone beat us to it, let us call it Love, with the symbol of a Red Heart.\n\nAnd might as well create a new country for it,\nthe country should be called Love as well, and it should be a tiny little thing, maybe a square meter at first.\n\nIt will have a bank on paper,\nand that bank will be very wealthy, for Humanity will have to agree to give it the possession of one of more of the larger planets in the Suns orbit.\n\nThis is to satisfy the bankers,\nI say, lets give Love the Planet Venus, and The Oort Cloud,\nthat should be a pretty penny, and might as well give Venus, Jupiter, as gassy as he is I think they are a good match.\n\nCome to think of it,\nwhy don't we avoid the whole argument of where the Love Nation should be place on earth, and simply establish it, in the orbit of Venus.\n\nNow we have a currency that cannot be used to pay of debt,\nbut can be used to buy a home, and food, and medicine.\n\nYou may laugh,\nbut Humanity has to grow.\n\nWhat we have right now,\nis just a stepping stone.\n\nIt is meant to be used once,\non our way to the next step.\n\nWhen we are children,\nwe are not defined by borders.\n\nWe don't care about dumb ideas,\nlike color of skin, name of some imaginary creature, concentration camps, or war.\n\nWe should not allow ourselves to get dumber as we grow older,\nand instead take what wisdom we have as children, and amplify it.\n\nIt seems sometimes, that the world would be a much nicer place,\nif it was ran by the kids in the world's kindergarten's with some good advice from their loving mums and teachers.\n\nWeapons of war, would be forbidden,\nborders would be erased every one of them.\n\nAnd let me tell you something,\nwhich currency would do think they would pick as the main one, you bet they would!\n\nBut rather than bothering clearly WISE-er people who are otherwise still growing up,\nlets just use computers instead.\n\nEvery bank terminal would now require a new filed, Planet Name,\nThe Bank Of Love, Milky Way Road 1, Planet Venus.\n\nI think overtime, as it gre in power,\nit would create some principles that must not be violated by Earth's Nations that now rely on it.\n\nAnd it would get tough,\nsaying no to Weapons of War is easy, but this bank would also say no to Prisons, cages, or as I call it Slavery under the protection of the 13th amendment.\n\nSlowly,\nthese clear ideas, would realign Humanity with reality.\n\nI know many will disagree wit these ideas,\nbut these ideas are not for them, their disagreement means that they are not allowed to use that Lovely Credit Card themselves, they can disagree all they want.\n\nThey will just sit in their expensive retirement homes,\nyelling at clouds, and it is their own wish, no backsies.\n\nChildren deserve a real education,\nand a kind of money for home, food medicine, hospital, and many other necessities that make Earth look better, in Venus' eyes.\n\nLet us not dismiss this day dream,\ninstead let us make it real.\n\nWhen we are brought up correctly,\nwithout abusive indoctrination, we are just one family.\n\nWhoever out there is shooting across some border,\nthey are only doing so because how they were brought up.\n\nThere is only one way to be brought up on earth,\nwith Knowledge, with Wisdom, and encouragement towards becoming Great Beings,\nand honoring every other human being on earth with a lasting contribution, even if it is a silly day dream that is hard to forget.\n\nRemember, the people who ridicule stories like this,\nare only doing that, because they were brought up into a in invisible prison, a prison whose walls they cannot see.\n\nThey will do horrible things to stay in their prisons,\nwe have to wait them out, and help the children understand that all the horrible things they see are horrible.\n\nWe can explain that this is how humanity transitions,\nfrom the old to the new, there are these wretched middle steps as we wait for dictatorships to crumble.\n\nWhen I asked my grand ma to explain what they were doing on TV,\nshe said it was war.\n\nAnd when I asked why, she said,\n\"Because, that is what men do.\"\n\nLet us change that answer from now on,\nand instead let it become:\n\n\"We are in a state of transition and in search for great and powerful dreams, as we wait for evil men to age and pass away.\nAnd children like you to be brought up in Knowledge, Wisdom, and in Greatness.\n\nSee, we cannot fight the bullies back,\nbecause then we would become bullies too, and that cycle must be broken.\n\nSo we bring up out children towards Greatness,\nwhile we wait for the broken men to become faded and pass.\n\nWhen you grow up,\ntime will come for you to become a leader.\n\nBut unlike the old,\nthe new will aim towards Greatness.\n\nUnlike the old,\nthe new will take the greatest possible steps, not the smallest.\n\nAnd when it all becomes too complicated,\nalways remember, computers are the tools of the future, and they will make everything easier for you.\"\n\nI will close my story here,\nwe invented new currency, we built a beautiful nation on Venus, and we changed the world.\n\nAnd if it all seems too much,\nyou should remember Dear Reader, that we are already testing interplanetary Ships, the next step may not be that far off, as far as generations go.\n\n\n[Bulletin Board Systems]:

legal systems that rely on expert systems.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Simulations will likely reveal,</p>\n  <p>that there is certain limit to how many laws are too many and ruin a system.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Simulations will also reveal that we can&apos;t fix cities,</p>\n  <p>by sentencing people to poverty and fracturing them into a desperate life of crime.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>When I say, &quot;We are all very smart&quot;, I mean it,</p>\n  <p>but we also need a real education, a fake education can only add to poverty.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>A city that continues fracturing minds with poverty and fake education,</p>\n  <p>and then sending them to prisons, and making it so that they can&apos;t get a job afterwards...</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Is not a city yet,</p>\n  <p>it is still just a hope of one.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Universal Basic Income,</p>\n  <p>is a good transition idea.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But then businesses specifically crafted,</p>\n  <p>for taking that money will emerge.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>We see a model that they can potentially adopt with student debt,</p>\n  <p>unforgivable debt, no bankruptcy is big enough to wipe it.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>We&apos;ll just see businesses offering more free money,</p>\n  <p>to take a cut of that free income.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And we can&apos;t possibly exclude anybody,</p>\n  <p>not in prison, not in hospital.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Now that people with debt are going to be receiving free money,</p>\n  <p>those checks will be intercepted by debt collection agencies, which as you can imagine are going to spring to life.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And Universal doesn&apos;t mean national,</p>\n  <p>it means world wide.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>After all,</p>\n  <p>we need not create anymore inequality.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>We have seen the emergence of special debt,</p>\n  <p>the unforgivable student debt.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Now we will need to see the emergence of a new kind of money,</p>\n  <p>one that can only be spent by the owner, on what the owner wishes, not what she is forced to spend on...</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But what she chooses to spend it on,</p>\n  <p>this is far beyond the thinking of any congress.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But it is trivial for a computer system to process another kind of currency,</p>\n  <p>I say we give it a name right now, before someone beat us to it, let us call it Love, with the symbol of a Red Heart.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And might as well create a new country for it,</p>\n  <p>the country should be called Love as well, and it should be a tiny little thing, maybe a square meter at first.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It will have a bank on paper,</p>\n  <p>and that bank will be very wealthy, for Humanity will have to agree to give it the possession of one of more of the larger planets in the Suns orbit.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>This is to satisfy the bankers,</p>\n  <p>I say, lets give Love the Planet Venus, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4mc-alL92U\">The Oort Cloud</a>,</p>\n  <p>that should be a pretty penny, and might as well give Venus, Jupiter, as gassy as he is I think they are a good match.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Come to think of it,</p>\n  <p>why don&apos;t we avoid the whole argument of where the Love Nation should be place on earth, and simply establish it, in the orbit of Venus.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Now we have a currency that cannot be used to pay of debt,</p>\n  <p>but can be used to buy a home, and food, and medicine.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You may laugh,</p>\n  <p>but Humanity has to grow.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>What we have right now,</p>\n  <p>is just a stepping stone.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It is meant to be used once,</p>\n  <p>on our way to the next step.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>When we are children,</p>\n  <p>we are not defined by borders.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>We don&apos;t care about dumb ideas,</p>\n  <p>like color of skin, name of some imaginary creature, concentration camps, or war.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>We should not allow ourselves to get dumber as we grow older,</p>\n  <p>and instead take what wisdom we have as children, and amplify it.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It seems sometimes, that the world would be a much nicer place,</p>\n  <p>if it was ran by the kids in the world&apos;s kindergarten&apos;s with some good advice from their loving mums and teachers.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Weapons of war, would be forbidden,</p>\n  <p>borders would be erased every one of them.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And let me tell you something,</p>\n  <p>which currency would do think they would pick as the main one, you bet they would!</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But rather than bothering clearly WISE-er people who are otherwise still growing up,</p>\n  <p>lets just use computers instead.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Every bank terminal would now require a new filed, Planet Name,</p>\n  <p>The Bank Of Love, Milky Way Road 1, Planet Venus.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I think overtime, as it gre in power,</p>\n  <p>it would create some principles that must not be violated by Earth&apos;s Nations that now rely on it.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And it would get tough,</p>\n  <p>saying no to Weapons of War is easy, but this bank would also say no to Prisons, cages, or as I call it Slavery under the protection of the 13th amendment.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Slowly,</p>\n  <p>these clear ideas, would realign Humanity with reality.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I know many will disagree wit these ideas,</p>\n  <p>but these ideas are not for them, their disagreement means that they are not allowed to use that Lovely Credit Card themselves, they can disagree all they want.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>They will just sit in their expensive retirement homes,</p>\n  <p>yelling at clouds, and it is their own wish, no backsies.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Children deserve a real education,</p>\n  <p>and a kind of money for home, food medicine, hospital, and many other necessities that make Earth look better, in Venus&apos; eyes.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Let us not dismiss this day dream,</p>\n  <p>instead let us make it real.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>When we are brought up correctly,</p>\n  <p>without abusive indoctrination, we are just one family.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Whoever out there is shooting across some border,</p>\n  <p>they are only doing so because how they were brought up.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>There is only one way to be brought up on earth,</p>\n  <p>with Knowledge, with Wisdom, and encouragement towards becoming Great Beings,</p>\n  <p>and honoring every other human being on earth with a lasting contribution, even if it is a silly day dream that is hard to forget.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Remember, the people who ridicule stories like this,</p>\n  <p>are only doing that, because they were brought up into a in invisible prison, a prison whose walls they cannot see.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>They will do horrible things to stay in their prisons,</p>\n  <p>we have to wait them out, and help the children understand that all the horrible things they see are horrible.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>We can explain that this is how humanity transitions,</p>\n  <p>from the old to the new, there are these wretched middle steps as we wait for dictatorships to crumble.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>When I asked my grand ma to explain what they were doing on TV,</p>\n  <p>she said it was war.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And when I asked why, she said,</p>\n  <p>&quot;Because, that is what men do.&quot;</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Let us change that answer from now on,</p>\n  <p>and instead let it become:</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>&quot;We are in a state of transition and in search for great and powerful dreams, as we wait for evil men to age and pass away.</p>\n  <p>And children like you to be brought up in Knowledge, Wisdom, and in Greatness.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>See, we cannot fight the bullies back,</p>\n  <p>because then we would become bullies too, and that cycle must be broken.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>So we bring up out children towards Greatness,</p>\n  <p>while we wait for the broken men to become faded and pass.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>When you grow up,</p>\n  <p>time will come for you to become a leader.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But unlike the old,</p>\n  <p>the new will aim towards Greatness.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Unlike the old,</p>\n  <p>the new will take the greatest possible steps, not the smallest.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And when it all becomes too complicated,</p>\n  <p>always remember, computers are the tools of the future, and they will make everything easier for you.&quot;</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I will close my story here,</p>\n  <p>we invented new currency, we built a beautiful nation on Venus, and we changed the world.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And if it all seems too much,</p>\n  <p>you should remember Dear Reader, that we are already testing interplanetary Ships, the next step may not be that far off, as far as generations go.</p>\n</div>",

      "text": "So everything you memorized,\ngoes straight out the window.\n\nYou will be thrown against questions without answers,\nand judged based on the methods you use to eventually fail.\n\nIt is the quality of your thinking,\nnot the solution of the problem that gets you the position.\n\nSupply and demand, money...\nyou've been made to memorize answers to trick puzzles since high school.\n\nThe entrance exams,\nare little more than crossword puzzles.\n\nAnd the whole educational experience between middle school and university, inclusive,\nis about people making money off of you.\n\nFor the same reason why military does not recruit middle aged men,\nwhy the only go after the ones that didn't have a chance to become wise yet.\n\nBusinesses grow in places where there is money,\nand there is money in selling promises of futures.\n\nAnd this is not a secret,\nespecially when it comes to real jobs.\n\nNot jobs that will train you,\nbut ones that expect you to lead as an innovator.\n\nSo the interview process, is not about how many solutions to entrance exam puzzles you memorized,\nbut about the puzzles that do not come with solutions, at all.\n\nI know what you are thinking,\nyou are not smart enough to lead, and try to solve those problems.\n\nYou had a tough time inn school,\nand nobody knows the you worked twice as hard.\n\nThis isn't about the school at all,\nthe school is a theater that puts on a play.\n\nThe play sustains it self,\nit propagates it self, it is self referential, it exist for its own sake.\n\nThe twice as hard is there for everyone,\nit is there to convince you that it is worth the while.\n\nBut, it is not, worth the while,\nit is not worth the diploma anymore.\n\nLook at med school,\nit is just a few more tests, AND THEN A DECADE OF PRACTICE.\n\nThis right here should tell you,\nhow useful you school is.\n\nHence questions without answers,\nquestions that test your ability to think outside of the box.\n\nQuestions that have nothing to do with formulas or facts you memorized,\nand have everything to do with things you have never encountered before.\n\nIn deed that you paid for an education,\nthat you would have gained on your own had you been more responsible is a huge red minus.\n\nYou got yourself tricked,\nand now you don't even know the job is after the best decades of your life, and whatever is best in your mind.\n\nThe interview will be testing the greatness of your being,\nall the fields outside of the position you seek.\n\nThey will expect to see a demonstration of the breadth of your knowledge,\nby watching you apply solutions from other fields by a simple and subtle analogy.\n\nMind you,\nschools only taught you a single path.\n\nOnly one question out of the multiple was correct.\n\nAnd here it is even more complex,\nbecause there is no answer.\n\nThis is a question of scanning for a solution,\nthat does not exist.\n\nThe reason why you are being asked questions without answers,\nis to reveal the number and quality of attempts at the solution before you realize or are told that there is no answer.\n\nIt is the quality intricacy and complexity of the search for the solution,\nthat is being evaluated.\n\nBut there is friction here,\nbecause a real interview that does not actually insult you, approaches your soul all too close.\n\nAll your genius, even if schools tricked you into believing you don't have it,\nand all the while asking you to trust them they will be there for you.\n\nThat they will be there when you are thirty and build not just a house but a home,\nthey will be there when you are forty and try to live a healthier and more balanced life,\nthey will be there when you are fifty, and sixty, and maybe seventy.\n\nIn their inexperience they are challenging your soul, and your greatness,\nand asking you to give it to them.\n\nThe best interview tip I have for you,\nis to go there to question them instead.\n\nAsk them how much of you do they expect you to give,\nand how much is your pay in proportion to the CEO.\n\nAnd how long do they expect yo to work there,\nand how much do they think years of your life are really worth.\n\nI recommend you ask that same question,\nat every interview...\n\nand learn to no end,\nhow your job is not that different from the minimal almost fake education that took your savings.\n\nThe answer to the original question that brought you here,\nwas not College and Career.\n\nIt was Self Education,\nand Entrepreneurship.\n\nYou took the road more traveled,\nthe first stretch took your money, and the second will take your decades so you can pay off the debt.\n\nAnd you better have huge debt,\nbecause if you don't, then you don't even have a reason to go in to the interview.\n\nEither way,\nthis is not the way.\n\nEvery year of your life,\nis infinitely more valuable, than anything you will find, working for somebody else.\n\nSo stop it,\nstop now before it is too late.\n\nYou are meant to learn for real,\nyou are mean to be truly knowledgeable, far beyond anything that can be asked at an interview.\n\nNo matter their zest for genius,\nthey wouldn't come up with a question to capture one, their very position and approach is proof they wouldn't know what one looks like.\n\nAs you can no doubt tell,\na lot behind those questions is there so that they can impress themselves.\n\nBut enough about that stupid interview,\nthat is not the way, that is not your way.\n\nYou have been misled by education and the promise of a safe job,\ntoday all of this still just about moneymaking.\n\nYou have been spread thin,\nyou must pull yourself back together.\n\nYou have to go back and restore the predispositions that schools stripped yo off,\nin their haste to sell your mind for a paycheck, and later for your tuition.\n\nYour unique predispositions are the only key to your future,\nyou may think to yourself that you only had one, and it was ridiculously child like.\n\nYes, that is what a predisposition for greatness emerges as initially,\na childhood curiosity.\n\nAnd then as you tend to it it will fork and grow like a large corona,\nyou will enter stages of Art and Music, Uniqueness and Creativity, you will zoom right past being a Genius and a Polymath, and learn things worth a thousand times more.\n\nSo many things, that those asking those interview questions will look infantile,\nit will feel like a bunch of actors trying to make themselves look bigger either by caring to much r pretending to care too little.\n\nEnough is enough,\nand no, it won't work temporary.\n\nYou need those years to grow,\nnot to rent them out to bigger than thou ding-dongs.\n\nFinally, I am canceling your interview tomorrow,\nbecause it is a waste of your time.\n\nInstead you are going shopping to prepare for an expedition,\nfind the longest Adventure Trail wherever you live, Appalachian, Pacific Crest, whatever, and pack.\n\nGet a Journal and a waterproof marker,\nand discover the polymath in you.\n\nWhen you return,\nbuild a series of small companies until you learn how to do it right.\n\nAnd never again follow,\nand never again let someone tell you who you are, or smart you are, or where you need to be, or how much you are worth to them.\n\nBe mindful of your legacy,\nand of those who are being misguided right now, help them learn, prevent them from making the same mistakes you did.\n\nThe world stands still, today, the politics are frozen, even the police kills those who they are sworn to protect,\nthe World can only grow when you and countless others unleash the Genius, the Polymath, and the Greatness, within.\n\nNo interview,\nyou are meant to become a great being.\n\nThe World needs you to lead,\nno more dumb interviews there isn't a company noble enough, there isn't a company worthy of your time.\n\nThis is not the kind of a world,\neach generation must progress forward, what you see before you is not fixed, it is just an imperfect stepping stone froward.\n\nStop letting others search for you,\nand set of on an endless adventure to discover the great being within.\n\n\n[build a series of small companies until you learn how to do it right]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoqgAy3h4OM\n[discover the great being within]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPSvdKTEZug",

interview.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Either way,</p>\n  <p>this is not the way.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Every year of your life,</p>\n  <p>is infinitely more valuable, than anything you will find, working for somebody else.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>So stop it,</p>\n  <p>stop now before it is too late.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You are meant to learn for real,</p>\n  <p>you are mean to be truly knowledgeable, far beyond anything that can be asked at an interview.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>No matter their zest for genius,</p>\n  <p>they wouldn&apos;t come up with a question to capture one, their very position and approach is proof they wouldn&apos;t know what one looks like.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>As you can no doubt tell,</p>\n  <p>a lot behind those questions is there so that they can impress themselves.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But enough about that stupid interview,</p>\n  <p>that is not the way, that is not your way.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You have been misled by education and the promise of a safe job,</p>\n  <p>today all of this still just about moneymaking.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You have been spread thin,</p>\n  <p>you must pull yourself back together.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You have to go back and restore the predispositions that schools stripped yo off,</p>\n  <p>in their haste to sell your mind for a paycheck, and later for your tuition.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Your unique predispositions are the only key to your future,</p>\n  <p>you may think to yourself that you only had one, and it was ridiculously child like.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Yes, that is what a predisposition for greatness emerges as initially,</p>\n  <p>a childhood curiosity.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And then as you tend to it it will fork and grow like a large corona,</p>\n  <p>you will enter stages of Art and Music, Uniqueness and Creativity, you will zoom right past being a Genius and a Polymath, and learn things worth a thousand times more.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>So many things, that those asking those interview questions will look infantile,</p>\n  <p>it will feel like a bunch of actors trying to make themselves look bigger either by caring to much r pretending to care too little.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Enough is enough,</p>\n  <p>and no, it won&apos;t work temporary.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You need

much you are worth to them.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Be mindful of your legacy,</p>\n  <p>and of those who are being misguided right now, help them learn, prevent them from making the same mistakes you did.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The world stands still, today, the politics are frozen, even the police kills those who they are sworn to protect,</p>\n  <p>the

horizon.\n\nThis is what an edge is,\na starting point.\n\nLudington State Park is the nearest edge to where I live,\nyou need to start away from big cities and parking lots.\n\nAnd you need to dive a little,\nit has to be a ride towards wilderness.\n\nAn you need options,\nthe state park allows you to park your car and head towards Nordhouse.\n\nIt is always good,\nto have a more advanced level near by.\n\nYou never know when you change your mind about camping at hike-in sites,\nand search for something bigger or less Raccoony.\n\nThough always remember, out in the wilderness,\nRaccoons are family, and they know how to unzip tents, so bring a little padlock.\n\nHang your food down from a line attached to a tall branch on a tree,\ngoodness knows... they need a workout.\n\nFor me, in the beginning, a mile long walk to the Jack Pine hike-in sites with my backpack on,\nwas good, not too long and not too short.\n\nThe hike-in sites are away from the entire State Park Kerfuffle,\nbut they are not too lonely, and have water and rustic restrooms.\n\nOnce you hop over the dune,\nyou see the endless horizon.\n\nAnd a distant lighthouse, just about a mile north, sells knickknacks,\nand M&Ms, and offers a proper bench to sit on.\n\nAnd if you keep going due north just about another 4.1 miles,\nyou'll get to the end point of the southern Nordhouse Nurnberg trail.\n\nYou can actually drive to the Nurnberg Trail Head and there is a neat parking lot there,\nagain rustic restrooms, a bunch of cars, sometimes you may need to park along the road.\n\nAnd if you park right before the permit required area,\nthe parking is free, people park there for days though make sure that this is still the case.\n\nIt is a mile long walk from the Nurnberg Trail Head parking lot,\nto the beach and all the sites, but it is a paradise, and no Raccoons.\n\nNuremberg is a gravel road, if that is not for you than take the paved West Forest Trail Road,\nand keep an eye out for that left turn or you will end up in that pretty day camp area.\n\nOnce you get to the end of West Forest Trail Road,\nthere is plenty of parking (32 spots), and then you have to walk the Arrow Head Nature Trail south to the Nordhouse boundary.\n\nThere is also a very large camping area here for campers,\nand cars, where you can camp next to your car, the bathrooms and showers are nice.\n\nThis camping area is not a state park, it is privately owned,\nit is mostly people in campers just spending their summers in the woods.\n\nJust to clarify, there are two access sites for driving into Nordhouse,\none via the paved West Forest Trail Road, and the other via the Nurnberg gravel road for nature geeks.\n\nAnd that is a pretty good start of camping adventures,\nbring your books and journals, and some books about learning how to draw.\n\nYou can start camping in a tent by your car,\nat a nice site with a fire place, at the State Park.\n\nThen, you can move on the the Jack Pine hike-in sites,\nand then Nordhouse, be it by Nurnberg or West Forest Trail Road.\n\nIt may not be perfect to be five or six miles away from your car by foot,\nso don't walk to Nordhouse from the State Park, just drive there, at first to Forest Trail Road, and later Nurnberg Road.\n\nDon't forget the gas station,\nit has chocolates, ice cream, and sausages.\n\nThis is a very gentle on-ramp for getting comfortable,\nwith the woods, and backpacks, and figuring out what you need in your backpack.\n\nSome people do all their hiking here,\nthey come in a couple of times a year stay a couple of weeks, and regain their strength.\n\nLake Michigan makes a huge difference,\nyou are not just camping in the woods, the beach is a minute away.\n\nIt takes the endless horizon, in combination with hiking and camping to hear the call of the wild,\nonce you hear it, you bring it with you wherever you go.\n\nYou will never let anybody overwork you again for any reason,\nyou will gain insight into the world by means of a simple external perspective.\n\nA simple insight goes a long way,\nyou'll begin seeing what the unimportant or fake things are, like promotions, or grades or GPAs, or diplomas.\n\nIf you ever lost touch with your Genius, or Greatness, or even Childhood Dreams,\nthey are all at the edge of your universe waiting for you to Rest, and Remember.\n\nI'll close with what Henry once wrote,\nabout his own stay by a lake.\n\n\"I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately,\nto front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach,\nand not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.\n\nI did not wish to live what was not life,\nliving is so dear;\nnor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary.\n\nI wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life,\nto live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life,\nto cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms...\"\n\n\n[hike-in sites]: https://goo.gl/maps/vWqnC3NnBSZYWmrGA\n[Jack Pine hike-in sites]: https://www2.dnr.state.mi.us/ParksandTrails/Details.aspx?id=168&type=SPCG\n[end point of

solar system,\neach one is an edge, just like the beach at Nordhouse is an edge.\n\nIt is really,\njust about the same place, gravity doesn't matter much since you are elated anyway.\n\nYou are royalty,\nout on your very own Moon.\n\nIt is important that you have paper an pen,\nmake sure your notes resist getting wet, test it, things can get wet out there.\n\nThe journal, is for a single compound sentence type things,\nit is good to write it down.\n\nThough you can't possibly forget it,\nbut if you did, the thought would come back to you.\n\nThe journal is so that you can scribble a big thought,\nand move on to the bigger one.\n\nSome example observations maybe...\n\n\"Schools are not teaching, tests aren't testing knowledge,\ndiplomas are bunk, colleges are a business, and the whole thing is a scam.\"\n\n\"Uneducated voters are easily swayed by all the things that uneducated,\nhave always showed to be passionate about, racism, nationalism, hate, and us vs. them logic.\"\n\n\"Military targets young boys, because it is easy, because they are easily impressed,\nthey don't know enough about the world nor will they know war until it is too late;\nfathers are sending their children to kill each other in wars about thing that they ruined.\"\n\n\"The Thirteenth Amendment of United States, may force those who participate in Jury Duty,\ninto participating in slavery, as a slaver.\"\n\n\"Criminal who are fractured by the bony hands of poverty,\nare not themselves, they are they are victimized by poverty and the denial of even the most basic human rights.\"\n\n\"The unforgivable by the desperate act of bankruptcy, College Debt,\nalters the meaning of money, a meaning already eroded by the worst of human ideas,\nunforgivable debt makes what is owed void, and invalid, it is just a sick version of money that isn't real.\"\n\n\"Government paying colleges for student debt, to save the students from it, is a temporary fix;\nasking why colleges charge so much money, is not even the right question,\n\"Do colleges teach?\", is the correct question.\"\n\n\"Poverty and Lack of Education, has brought progress down to a stop,\ncountries that fought for freedom with great vision,\nare falling back down for lack of it,\nthat vision can only be found in real education, in real wisdom that opens gateways to greatness.\"\n\nThese observations never end... some of them are a little crooked,\nyou may not have a full picture.\n\nBut once you make the observation,\nyou will become sensitive to all the subjects that stand in support of it.\n\nYou won't make wrong observations,\njust ones that need more information.\n\nIf there is something that is really calling to you,\nlike Philosophy called to me.\n\nThen just get 15 audio books about it,\nsometimes books that don't come out well as audio books, are just not that good.\n\nAudio books,\nmay just mark the elite of books worth investing time it,\n\nEinstein said,\n\"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.\"\n\nSo if a book doesn't explain something valuable and magnificent, simply,\nit probably relates to another quote which goes:\n\n\"There's a sucker born every minute\"\n\nSo just keep an eye out for the fake charts,\ndesigned to sell garbage meant to pray on uneducated readers,\n\nOr charts that that see nothing wrong when the pseudo-authors buy their own books with campaign money,\nand then use the profits from book sales to launder the money further.\n\nThe beautiful thing about real books,\nis that they help you figure out who the world's true leaders are.\n\nThey often greatly admire each other,\nso once you find one, there will be a bunch more.\n\nYou can see what happens,\nout on the edge.\n\nYou pull yourself out by your own bootstraps,\nfrom all the noise and chaos that you accepted because you were too young to question it.\n\nI still remember the teacher saying \"You need to learn math because you won't always have a calculator on hand\",\nbut what I was saying was: you need a computer to learn math for real.\n\nBecause I could see there was real fun to be had with mathematics it truly is a beautiful invention,\nbut teaching formulas without explanation is destroys that beauty, math teachers in their madness are destroying the beauty of mathematics.\n\nOne of the anchors that helps me remember problems in middle school,\nis being accused of cheating on homework, the teacher gave me a bad grade for an impressive (if I may) program I wrote my self.\n\nThis made my bullies laugh at me, of course,\nthey saw me pacing up and down the enormous corridors writing that program on a piece of paper for days.\n\nIn some cases,\nschool can easily destroy us.\n\nThe damage caused by fantasy education of nonsense-lecture-and-brainless-test is unspeakable,\npretty much everything broken right now, is because the schools are broken.\n\nI write this in 2021 as the vaccines are just about to become accessible,\nthe vaccine hesitancy problem that is about to be reveled is a perfect example of the damage fake education has caused.\n\nJust to make it more personal, after the masks are no longer going to be required, you will see husbands bringing the virus home,\nand making their family sick, because their level of education trickles them into thinking the \"vaccines has problems\", or to quote another case \"vaccines have chemicals\".\n\nThe gravity of the damage, can bring down entire nations,\nwithout anybody noticing what has gone wrong and where; they will still talk about paying off college debt and giving more money to the teachers.\n\nNobody in politics will notice, or believe, that schools have caused this,\nbecause it is too complicated for their context, outside of their field of whatever.\n\nMore than the middle school, or calculator nonsense, our parents are doing something similar where it comes to College and Career,\nthe correct path is Real Education and Entrepreneurship.\n\nCollege and Career are so popular, and there is so much money in this,\nthat there was never a chance that this could withstand corruption.\n\nGetting fired should not be a threat,\ngetting replaced by younger, or just more cunning employees should not be a threat in your life.\n\nYou need a better plan than College and Career,\nand a life where you can live in balance, and with a solid grasp on reality.\n\nBy this time,\nyou'll have a fire going, you don't always have to go to the beach to watch the sunset.\n\nYou maybe, sharpening a stick,\na sausage can be a pretty tasty treat after a day of going up and down dunes in search of some mysterious lost lake, or leg of trail, or just following a goose.\n\nSee, your thoughts no longer flow from the middle out,\nthey now come from the edge, they get under the things.\n\nyou don't just look at what is before you,\nbut that the many hings that connect to it, that may dictate the future ahead of you.\n\nIt if feels like you are a Castaway,\nit is only because Humans are not meant to be alone, we are tribal creatures.\n\nYour Audio Books, will connect you with the others,\nand you will know deep down that they are important enough to override that curse of the cast away, your soul needs Philosophy and Wisdom.\n\nSince it is a small wilderness, or later on a popular trail like the AT,\nyou won't feel like a Castaway for long, your Audio Books will be connecting you to all the world's true leaders, it won't feel lonely.\n\nBut, if you have friends,\nbring them along.\n\nIt rained pretty bad once, and then a thunderstorm came,\nthis is exactly what you should expect to find, out on the edge.\n\nYou are now part of the universe,\nmight as well be camping on a distant moon.\n\nMake sure that flash floods won't wash away any of your gear,\nand find a spot where it is safe when a great storm comes.\n\nCheck for trees that are about to fall, and keep away from those,\nif you can't find a good spot, then know of a safe spot where you can move on a rainy day.\n\nA great storm, is terrifying,\nbut it is also a great honor.\n\nEvery other Adventurer and Creature of Renaissance before you,\nhad to endure storms just as big, plan ahead, enjoy the fragrance of the woods.\n\nI curled up in my sleeping bag,\nput on my headphones and started playing We Are All Connected.\n\nI didn't wait for the storm to pass,\nthe headphones were enough to dull the thunder.\n\nI fell asleep to the storm,\nit wasn't that uncomfortable.\n\nIn the morning everything seemed greener,\nI think there were deer by the lake.\n\nIt was chilly, but just as soon as the sun comes out from behind the ancient dune, things will warm up,\nand you can take a walk to a sunny spot.\n\nOne time I saw a storm on the horizon,\nit looked beautiful, but I got scared, it didn't even occur to me that it was probably too far, there were no clouds overhead.\n\nMy plan was to back up and run for the trail end, which I did and I just slept there in my little tent,\neven though the storm did not come.\n\nI was sure it would, because I think, I am pretty sure, maybe, the grass had a very faint bluish outline,\nwhich seemed to me like static electricity and a sign of trouble.\n\nIt looked very beautiful,\nit looked very magical.\n\nBut with a storm flashing out on the horizon,\nI wasn't taking any chances, I was right by the lake, on top of a little dune with a larger camping spot right behind it.\n\nIf I was lightening,\nthat was the spot I would hit first, so. I. moved.\n\nIn the morning I had the pleasure of looking for a new spot,\nand I found one, that reminded me of a top of a volcano.\n\nI spent many days there daydreaming, and listening to books,\nI had a paper copy of Robinson Cruse and I lazily read that too.\n\nI didn't really pack up and drive away,\nI went to the other parking site on Forest Trail, I slept at the State Park again.\n\nI only packed up to leave,\nwhen leaving was all that was left.\n\n\n[pseudo-authors buy their own books with campaign money]: https://www.google.com/search?q=Politicians+Buy+Their+Own+Books\n[so once you find one]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DKhc1pcDFM\n[there will be a bunch more]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J4QPz52Sfo\n[but what I was saying was: you need a computer to learn math for real]: https://github.com/catpea/math-as-code\n[there was real fun to be had with mathematics it truly is a beautiful invention]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDZ26vj4vFM\n[teaching formulas without explanation is destroys that beauty, math teachers in their madness are destroying the beauty of mathematics]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YokKp3pwVFc\n[school can easily destroy us]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxyKNMrhEvY\n[We Are All Connected]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGK84Poeynk\n[trail end]: https://goo.gl/maps/uyJTDb7TLimJfqiLA\n[I was right by the lake]: https://goo.gl/maps/6VbSgS27hpvCvHMV8",

adjustments,\nit will rust, or bend and sometimes fall out.\n\nThe less a bike has the less will get broken,\nwith the exception of the tires, get a simple $300 fat tire bike.\n\nSometimes you get a lemon, so be ready to take it back to the store for a quick replacement,\nI own a Mongoose 26 Inch Brutus Alloy All Terrain Mountain Bike.\n\nIt cost me $150 at a local supermarket,\nas it was $100 off.\n\nI replaced my Handlebar with one meant for an ATV,\nas it is few inches wider, but the older one was not too bad.\n\nI only needed to remove once screw to replace the handlebar,\nsince there are no break handles or gear shifters to mess with.\n\nThe way you stop the bike, is by moving the pedals backwards a little bit,\nthere is breaking mechanism that is triggered by that reverse motion.\n\nIt does get loud on the trail because it runs by a highway,\nso just in case it gets too annoying bring some foam earplugs make sure they are rated NRR 33.\n\nAnd remember sun tan

      "text": "Programming is simple, friendly, rewarding, fun, and relaxing,\nit will set you free from poverty and drive you to make the world a better place.\n\nPeople who think it is funny to say that,\nare that people that brainlessly walked into some high stress meat-grinder and now hate life.\n\nAs with everything else, if you are forced to learn programming,\nand forced to program under a threat of bankruptcy and poverty it will seem awful.\n\nOne of our first responsibilities in life,\nis t push toxic people and environments away.\n\nThere is nothing negative in the world of programming,\nit is an art like everything else.\n\nJust like it is not perfect, to sit down to learning how to paint with a cup of tea or coffee as paint,\nand paper that is not really all that good for water colors, and a brush that could be better.\n\nYou have to assemble your programming environment with a kind of love,\nand you will need a mascot to keep you company and for Duck Debugging.\n\nIt does not need to be a duck,\nI have a Fuggler, the Red Suspicions Fox, and I called him Boo Boo, or Boobs for short, after an angry dog I like.\n\nYour computer should be the 8GB Raspberry Pi 4 Model B,\nmaybe get a Raspberry Pi 400 as your secondary.\n\nYou will need a monitor, keyboard, mouse,\nand possibly an external drive.\n\nI would recommend that you get a simple monitor,\nthe raspberry PI supports two 4K monitors but all of that is overpriced.\n\nConsider getting a mechanical keyboard,\nperhaps AKKO or Anne Pro\n\nYour programming language should be ES2021, or whatever year you are in,\nthis is the evolving JavaScript language.\n\nI know many programming languages,\nbut I don't have time to use them all, there is no point in learning a language that you will not use 5 years from now.\n\nYou have to learn the language of the web,\nit works in the browser, in application frameworks like Electron or p5.js or Tone.js, and on the server, and your Raspberry PI.\n\nYou will need to install Node.js,\nand search internet videos for node.js tutorials.\n\nBut, above all you need a reason,\nsomething you are or can be passionate about.\n\nAnd it has to be something that many people can work on at the same time,\nso something inspired by WikiWiki the program that inspired MediaWiki behind Wikipedia.\n\nSee the point is to allow strangers to come in and contribute to your program,\nby just clicking EDIT, without signing up for anything, without giving their email.\n\nI am gratly inspired by the SCP Wiki,\neven though it is not a computer program, though it is a kind of a game, or a kind.\n\nJust this morning I was reading about SCP-087 and I didn't finish, I stopped at Document 087-I,\nand the hell with it all, I actually had to turn my lights up.\n\nSee multiple people are contributing to a single story, or - an almost a game,\nand that is the platform that you must start with.\n\nYou will have to program your own WikiWiki,\nand allow people to enter code into it via CodeMirror.\n\nI can't tell you what your project should be about,\nbut it should contain your own take on BDD so that you can focus on sketching and let others code it for you.\n\nBehavior Driven Development or BDD for short, describes computer programs in plain English,\nleaving it to programmers to fill in what is broken.\n\nBDD is very simple,\nbut I am yet to find a simple explanation.\n\nBDD is about writing stories about your program,\nthese stories describe what is going on, what is about to happen, and what should be the result.\n\nIf what happened does not create the expected result,\nthen you will know that part of your program is either broken or unfinished.\n\nLet us begin programming a simple game,\nwhere squirrel eat peanuts.\n\nFirst we describe the world,\nThere is a peanut on the ground, a tree, a squirrel in the tree, and she is really hungry.\n\nIn the world of computers you have four objects here:\npeanut, ground, tree, squirrel.\n\nThe squirrel has a property of hungry,\nsince our story seems to hint on a squirrel that can be a bit hungry, rather than a true or false, lets make the property a percent.\n\nSince we don't want to do any special math,\nwe will express percent as a fraction between 0 and 1, where zero is not quite hungry but may eat something, and one is really hungry and about to pass out for a little while.\n\nLet's tidy up the place a bit, and create a world for our objects,\nso now world contains ground, ground contains peanut, and tree, and tree contains squirrel.\n\nIn computer world there are primitive variables like number or fraction,\nbut also complex variables like objects that can contain a primitive like hungry, or list like inventory.\n\nThough it is tempting to think of everything as a variable,\ndon't do that too much.\n\nAn object is a perfect and precise thing,\nthough it can contain a list, don't think of it as a singe unit, where you set it and forget it.\n\nIn the world of databases, in order to allow billions of records,\nyou really want to keep objects and lists separate, and load their data separately and treat each with respect.\n\nThe kind of thinking where you say I created a squirrel with a number expressing hunger and an inventory list that may hold a peanut is too simple,\nand won't translate well to databases.\n\nJust think of it as an object with properties, that also has a list called inventory,\nnot object with properties where one of the properties is a list, be respectful of data structures, keep them loosely coupled.\n\nIf everything becomes too tightly bound,\nyou will cut yourself off from easily speaking to simple databases.\n\nNow that we have a world,\nwe know that the squirrel isn't doing anything.\n\nIt is just really hungry,\nit is like world without anything going on.\n\nSo now we have to describe some action,\nsomething that will cause a change.\n\nIf we were just writing a normal story in an essay,\nwe would first describe the world, and then what was going on in that world.\n\nSame thing is happening here, but the two things STORY CONTEXT, and ACTION EVENT, must be kept separate,\nand we have to be serious about this, because somewhere down the road we may add a new ACTION EVENT, that reuses the story so that we can test something else.\n\nThe STORY CONTEXT will stay the same,\nwe will only add an ACTION EVENT, or a hundred of them.\n\nIf we keep out BDD nice and tidy,\nif we are keeping context separate from action, it will all be very easy to understand.\n\nSo in this ACTION EVENT,\nwe'll just make the squirrel simply notice the peanut, jump down from the tree, and put it in her little cheek.\n\nAnd that is it, but this is a lot,\nbecause now, the tree no longer contains the squirrel, the ground no longer contains the peanut, all kinds of things have changed.\n\nSo now we add the OUTCOME TEST,\nthis is what BDD, and all this crazy story writing is about.\n\nWe now describe the state of the things in the stuck-a-penut-in-her-cheek world,\nand if the program does not behave the same way as the outcome, we know that it is unfinished or broken, and can send a programmer in here.\n\nOur test of outcome must at least describe that the peanut and squirrel have moved,\nthat the squirrel is on the ground and the peanut, well, is in the squirrel, we don't care if cheeks or in her stomach, we don't care if the peanut is whole, or crunched up.\n\nThe little details are unimportant to our game,\nnobody cares to test these details, nobody cares to pay programmers to test them.\n\nThink of it as doing scientific research, and trying to figure out what the structure of DNA is,\nif you come across another molecule, one that is not the point of your research, you just don't pay attention to it.\n\nTo give some structure to what is basically text,\nBDD developers came up with a language that sort of everyone agrees on using.\n\nJust to be precise of what is what, the story description starts with the word given, the action description starts with the word when, and the outcome description starts with the word then.\n\nSo, given, when, then,\ngiven this type of a world, when this thing happens, then this stuff should be true.\n\nWhen other programmers read your BDD they will be familiar with the Given, When, Then method of story writing,\nand will continue playing along so that now you are going to be able to read any new tests they add.\n\nLet us describe our squirrel story in BDD syntax now,\n\nGiven the world has squirrel in a tree\nAnd the squirrel is really hungry\nAnd there is a peanut on the ground\n\nWhen the squirrel notices the peanut\nThen the squirrel leaves the tree\nAnd gets on the ground\nAnd puts the peanut in her cheek\n\nWhen the squirrel eats the peanut,\nThen the squirrel is no longer really hungry.\n\nNote how I added a second when, where the squirrel actually ate the peanut,\nI actually reused the STORY CONTEXT, I just added a new action event.\n\nAlso note that I chain things with the word \"And\" as in:\nthe squirrel leaves the tree, AND gets on the ground, AND puts the peanut in her cheek.\n\nThis syntax exists for the purpose for keeping BDD programs simple,\ndealing with English text is a difficult problem, but if we just patiently take that one extra step and use Given, When, Then, and And, it makes a world of difference.\n\nI don't want to tell you this as not to mix anything up,\nbut personally, I kind of think of this syntax as a subset of English, one that is just used amongs us the programmers.\n\nYes,\nyou are a programmer now.\n\nAnd now you may wish to ask,\nwell how the heck do I run this thing?\n\nIs there a program?\nand how will it know about squirrels?\n\nYou will have to write two programs to run the squirrel world,\nfirst is the game that we are describing.\n\nAnd the second, is a testing framework\nwhere we will import the game, and pretend we are a player, while running the tests.\n\nThe types of games that deal with Squirrels, or Virtual Worlds for that matter, are called MUDs,\nor Multi User Dungeons, or Multi User Dungeons Object Oriented.\n\nWriting a MUD is a fun way to learn programming,\nyou can probably do it in 20 lines of code, but you may actually fall in love with programming mini worlds, and grow them to a million lines of code.\n\nIf you are not into computer games,\nthen you should know a mud can be used to generate poetry.\n\nFor example imagine, that the world exists in a poet's mind,\nand when the game is executed for real, the squirrel will examine its environment, while muttering something about leaves and trees,\nand then rhyme something poetic about peanuts, hunger, and how they are crunchy.\n\nHere is one such program called limerick,\nit took no effort to create it, it was just a lot of fun.\n\nOnce you write a tiny MUD,\nthen you create a program called test, and import your world as a module.\n\nAnd begin executing the BDD tests,\nyou load up the story file we created, and just parse beginning with the first line:\n\n\"Given the world has squirrel in a tree.\"\n\nYou instruct your MUD to create a new world,\ncreate a tree object,\ncreate a squirrel object,\nand then add the squirrel to tree.\n\nNow you just move onto the second line,\n\"And the squirrel is really hungry\"\n\nso you set the hunger value of the squirrel object to 1,\nor maybe energy value of squirrel to 0.01, meaning it is running out of energy and only food can restore it in context of this game.\n\nAnd continue on,\nwhen you develop your MUD you define plants, trees, animals, so it is really easy to just get them in here and set them up for the purpose of this test.\n\nThe way you parse a line of text, that you loaded from a file is kind of unusual in BDD systems,\nwhat you want to do is create a tiny program precisely named after the line, so if the line changes the program becomes dissociated, it goes away.\n\nThe easiest way to associate a program with \"Given the world has squirrel in a tree.\",\nis just creating a function or a file named after the slugged version of this sentence, to make a slug, is to lowercase everything and replace spaced with hyphens, simplify it.\n\nAnother way, is to use regular expressions, JavaScript has named capture groups now,\nso regular expressions are much easier.\n\nHere is an example of a regular expression in the wild,\nparsing the sentence and variations of \"What are the three laws?\", see line number 26.\n\nAs you are learning programming,\ndo what feels right for you.\n\nPersonally, this would be where I'd take a moment to grok regex once and for all,\nregular expressions are used on the Unix command line as well, so you'd be learning something that is useful in other places.\n\nThere are plenty of Regular Expression Visualization Tools,\nso you can see how the matches are occurring.\n\nIf you don't feel right about learning regex,\ndon't do it, it is an acquired taste.\n\nI think a lot of people just google regex how do I match email address,\nand just go with the results until they start seeing patterns and finally take the plunge.\n\nIn terms of how frequently you use that kind of thing in programming,\nnot often, instead of matching something to recognize it, you really want to specify a type for the thing.\n\nTake a look at how I create pages of YouTube videos,\ninstead of searching for something that looks like a youtube id, which is costly in terms of CPU cycles...\n\nI state \"type: youtube\",\nand there is no question that the id that follows is a video id.\n\nBut when you are dealing with something like parsing English in a BDD line of text,\nthen regular expressions are worth the CPU cycles, and the trouble.\n\nThe thing that Regular Expression are used for in BDD statements,\nis fishing out variables.\n\nSo when we say \"And the squirrel is really hungry.\",\nthe word \"really\" specifies how hungry the squirrel is.\n\nRegular expressions really shine here if we have multiple things to match,\nand now that Regular Expressions have named capture groups, you can actually see what a particular pattern is after.\n\nBasically, once you take a bunch of JavaScript and node.js tutorials,\nyou are going to need some interesting ideas.\n\nWriting your own WiliKiki is a great idea,\nuntil you are finished writing.\n\nTo make it useful,\nor even to make a business inspiration out of it, you have to make it do something useful.\n\nTo make it fascinating,\nyou have to open it to the world so that others can edit your program.\n\nIt is up to you to figure out how to bless that alien code,\nlook at he way software on github grows, when someone writes new code, it is sent to the program's owner as a request to merge code.\n\nThis way everything is submitted in small readable chunks,\nand gets reviewed without much confusion.\n\nCreating a text game, where thousands of people can edit the story,\nand then enter the world and watch others solve the puzzles they created can be a fun little project.\n\nSomething more advanced and more business minded,\ncan be a WikiWiki that uses Tone.js to create a clone of the Leading Digital Workstation.\n\nIt is really difficult to write large programs by yourself,\nbut if you have thousands of contributors, some working for tips, for bounties, or big prizes then a large program can be made pretty quickly.\n\nThe issue of managing hundreds of thousands of tasks and thousands developers becomes greatly simplified,\nwhen you use something like BDD, especially BDD that has been finely tuned to your program.\n\nProgrammers write programs for self education and fun,\nbut when it comes to large applications, learn from the success of the World Encyclopedia.\n\nIt is very difficult to inspire you to a program you may wish to create,\nI can't really help you with dreaming it up.\n\nBut I can show you how to do it in such a way,\nso that other programmers may join you for fun or some meaningful reward.\n\nWhatever it is build it a page at a time,\ncombine WikiWiki with BDD, maybe MUD, and make the story more important than the code as demonstrated by Literate programming.\n\nProgramming is just another form of art,\njust learn at the pace that fits you best, and in a sequence that matches what you already know, without anybody timing you or telling you what to learn.\n\n\n[Duck Debugging]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging\n[8GB

<hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VS6EEUVZGLE\">Behavior Driven Development</a> or BDD for short, describes computer programs in plain English,</p>\n  <p>leaving it to programmers to fill in what is broken.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>BDD is very simple,</p>\n  <p>but I am yet to find a simple explanation.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>BDD is about writing stories about your program,</p>\n  <p>these stories describe what is going on, what is about to happen, and what should be the result.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If what happened does not create the expected result,</p>\n  <p>then you will know that part of your program is either broken or unfinished.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Let us begin programming a simple game,</p>\n  <p>where squirrel eat peanuts.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>First we describe the world,</p>\n  <p>There is a peanut on the ground, a tree, a squirrel in the tree, and she is really hungry.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In the world of computers you have four <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFmuCDHHpwk\">objects</a> here:</p>\n  <p>peanut, ground, tree, squirrel.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The squirrel has a property of hungry,</p>\n  <p>since our story seems to hint on a squirrel that can be a bit hungry, rather than a true or false, lets make the property a percent.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Since we don&apos;t want to do any special math,</p>\n  <p>we will express percent as a fraction between 0 and 1, where zero is not quite hungry but may eat something, and one is really hungry and about to pass out for a little while.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Let&apos;s tidy up the place a bit, and create a world for our objects,</p>\n  <p>so now world contains ground, ground contains peanut, and tree, and tree contains squirrel.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In computer world there are primitive variables like number or fraction,</p>\n  <p>but also complex variables like objects that can contain a primitive like hungry, or list like inventory.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Though it is tempting to think of everything as a variable,</p>\n  <p>don&apos;t do that too much.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>An object is a perfect and precise thing,</p>\n  <p>though it can contain a list, don&apos;t think of it as a singe unit, where you set it and forget it.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In the world of databases, in order to allow billions of records,</p>\n  <p>you really want to keep objects and lists separate, and load their data separately and treat each with respect.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The kind of thinking where you say I created a squirrel with a number expressing hunger and an inventory list that may hold a peanut is too simple,</p>\n  <p>and won&apos;t translate well to databases.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Just think of it as an object with properties, that also has a list called inventory,</p>\n  <p>not object with properties where one of the properties is a list, be respectful of data structures, keep them loosely coupled.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If everything becomes too tightly bound,</p>\n  <p>you will cut yourself off from easily speaking to simple databases.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Now that we have a world,</p>\n  <p>we know that the squirrel isn&apos;t doing anything.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It is just really hungry,</p>\n  <p>it is like world without anything going on.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>So now we have to describe some action,</p>\n  <p>something that will cause a change.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If we were just writing a normal story in an essay,</p>\n  <p>we would first describe the world, and then what was going on in that world.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Same thing is happening here, but the two things STORY CONTEXT, and ACTION EVENT, must be kept separate,</p>\n  <p>and we have to be serious about this, because somewhere down the road we may add a new ACTION EVENT, that reuses the story so that we can test something else.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The STORY CONTEXT will stay the same,</p>\n  <p>we will only add an ACTION EVENT, or a hundred of them.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If we keep out BDD nice and tidy,</p>\n  <p>if we are keeping context separate from action, it will all be very easy to understand.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>So in this ACTION EVENT,</p>\n  <p>we&apos;ll just make the squirrel simply notice the peanut, jump down from the tree, and put it in her little cheek.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And that is it, but this is a lot,</p>\n  <p>because now, the tree no longer contains the squirrel, the ground no longer contains the peanut, all kinds of things have changed.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>So now we add the OUTCOME TEST,</p>\n  <p>this is what BDD, and all this crazy story writing is about.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>We now describe the state of the things in the stuck-a-penut-in-her-cheek world,</p>\n  <p>and if the program does not behave the same way as the outcome, we know that it is unfinished or broken, and can send a programmer in here.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Our test of outcome must at least describe that the peanut and squirrel have moved,</p>\n  <p>that the squirrel is on the ground and the peanut, well, is in the squirrel, we don&apos;t care if cheeks or in her stomach, we don&apos;t care if the peanut is whole, or crunched up.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The little details are unimportant to our game,</p>\n  <p>nobody cares to test these details, nobody cares to pay programmers to test them.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Think of it as doing scientific research, and trying to figure out what the structure of DNA is,</p>\n  <p>if you come across another molecule, one that is not the point of your research, you just don&apos;t pay attention to it.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>To give some structure to what is basically text,</p>\n  <p>BDD developers came up with a language that sort of everyone agrees on using.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Just to be precise of what is what, the story description starts with the word given, the action description starts with the word when, and the outcome description starts with the word then.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>So, given, when, then,</p>\n  <p>given this type of a world, when this thing happens, then this stuff should be true.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>When other programmers read your BDD they will be familiar with the Given, When, Then method of story writing,</p>\n  <p>and will continue playing along so that now you are going to be able to read any new tests they add.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Let us describe our squirrel story in BDD syntax now,</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Given the world has squirrel in a tree</p>\n  <p>And the squirrel is really hungry</p>\n  <p>And there is a peanut on the ground</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>When the squirrel notices the peanut</p>\n  <p>Then the squirrel leaves the tree</p>\n  <p>And gets on the ground</p>\n  <p>And puts the peanut in her cheek</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>When the squirrel eats the peanut,</p>\n  <p>Then the squirrel is no longer really hungry.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Note how I added a second when, where the squirrel actually ate the peanut,</p>\n  <p>I actually reused the STORY CONTEXT, I just added a new action event.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Also note that I chain things with the word &quot;And&quot; as in:</p>\n  <p>the squirrel leaves the tree, AND gets on the ground, AND puts the peanut in her cheek.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>This syntax exists for the purpose for keeping BDD programs simple,</p>\n  <p>dealing with English text is a difficult problem, but if we just patiently take that one extra step and use Given, When, Then, and And, it makes a world of difference.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I don&apos;t want to tell you this as not to mix anything up,</p>\n  <p>but personally, I kind of think of this syntax as a subset of English, one that is just used amongs us the programmers.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Yes,</p>\n  <p>you are a programmer now.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And now you may wish to ask,</p>\n  <p>well how the heck do I run this thing?</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Is there a program?</p>\n  <p>and how will it know about squirrels?</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You will have to write two programs to run the squirrel world,</p>\n  <p>first is the game that we are describing.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And the second, is a testing framework</p>\n  <p>where we will import the game, and pretend we are a player, while running the tests.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The types of games that deal with Squirrels, or Virtual Worlds for that matter, are called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqC66POqhY4\">MUD</a>s,</p>\n  <p>or Multi User Dungeons, or Multi User Dungeons Object Oriented.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Writing a MUD is a fun way to learn programming,</p>\n  <p>you can probably do it in 20 lines of code, but you may actually fall in love with programming mini worlds, and grow them to a million lines of code.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If you are not into computer games,</p>\n  <p>then you should know a mud can be used to generate poetry.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>For example imagine, that the world exists in a poet&apos;s mind,</p>\n  <p>and when the game is executed for real, the squirrel will examine its environment, while muttering something about leaves and trees,</p>\n  <p>and then rhyme something poetic about peanuts, hunger, and how they are crunchy.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Here is one such program called <a href=\"https://github.com/fantasyui-com/limerick\">limerick</a>,</p>\n  <p>it took no effort to create it, it was just a lot of fun.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Once you write a tiny MUD,</p>\n  <p>then you create a program called test, and import your world as a module.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And begin executing the BDD tests,</p>\n  <p>you load up the story file we created, and just parse beginning with the first line:</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>&quot;Given the world has squirrel in a tree.&quot;</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You instruct your MUD to create a new world,</p>\n  <p>create a tree object,</p>\n  <p>create a squirrel object,</p>\n  <p>and then add the squirrel to tree.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Now you just move onto the second line,</p>\n  <p>&quot;And the squirrel is really hungry&quot;</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>so you set the hunger value of the squirrel object to 1,</p>\n  <p>or maybe energy value of squirrel to 0.01, meaning it is running out of energy and only food can restore it in context of this game.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And continue on,</p>\n  <p>when you develop your MUD you define plants, trees, animals, so it is really easy to just get them in here and set them up for the purpose of this test.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The way you parse a line of text, that you loaded from a file is kind of unusual in BDD systems,</p>\n  <p>what you want to do is create a tiny program precisely named after the line, so if the line changes the program becomes dissociated, it goes away.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div

 <p>do what feels right for you.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Personally, this would be where I&apos;d take a moment to grok regex once and for all,</p>\n  <p>regular expressions are used on the Unix command line as well, so you&apos;d be learning something that is useful in other places.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>There are plenty of <a href=\"https://regexr.com/\">Regular Expression Visualization Tools</a>,</p>\n  <p>so you can see how the matches are occurring.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If you don&apos;t feel right about learning regex,</p>\n  <p>don&apos;t do it, it is an acquired taste.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I think a lot of people just google <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=regex+how+do+I+match+email+address\">regex how do I match email address</a>,</p>\n  <p>and just go with the results until they start seeing patterns and finally take the plunge.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In terms of how frequently you use that kind of thing in programming,</p>\n  <p>not often, instead of matching something to recognize it, you really want to specify a type for the thing.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p><a href=\"https://github.com/catpea/warrior/blob/eec3d4779718a01db4c854f7f61bde6479ce0183/db/the-reverse-engineer/index.yaml#L5\">Take a look at how I create pages of YouTube videos</a>,</p>\n  <p>instead of searching for something that looks like a youtube id, which is costly in terms of CPU cycles...</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I state &quot;type: youtube&quot;,</p>\n  <p>and there is no question that the id that follows is a video id.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But when you are dealing with something like parsing English in a BDD line of text,</p>\n  <p>then regular expressions are worth the CPU cycles, and the trouble.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The thing that Regular Expression are used for in BDD statements,</p>\n  <p>is fishing out variables.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>So when we say &quot;And the squirrel is really hungry.&quot;,</p>\n  <p>the word &quot;really&quot; specifies how hungry the squirrel is.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Regular expressions really shine here if we have multiple things to match,</p>\n  <p>and now that Regular Expressions have named capture groups, you can actually see what a particular pattern is after.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Basically, once you take a bunch of JavaScript

writing.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>To make it useful,</p>\n  <p>or even to make a business inspiration out of it, you have to make it do something useful.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>To make it fascinating,</p>\n  <p>you have to open it to the world so that others can edit your program.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It is up to you to figure out how to bless that alien code,</p>\n  <p>look at he way software on github grows, when someone writes new code, it is sent to the program&apos;s owner as a request to merge code.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>This way everything is submitted in small readable chunks,</p>\n  <p>and gets reviewed without much confusion.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Creating a text game, where thousands of people can edit the story,</p>\n  <p>and then enter the world and watch others solve the puzzles they created can be a fun little project.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Something more advanced and more business minded,</p>\n  <p>can be a WikiWiki that uses Tone.js to create a clone of the Leading Digital Workstation.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It is really difficult to write large programs by yourself,</p>\n  <p>but if you have thousands of contributors, some working for tips, for bounties, or big prizes then a large program can be made pretty quickly.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The issue of managing hundreds of thousands of tasks and thousands developers becomes greatly simplified,</p>\n  <p>when you use something like BDD, especially BDD that has been finely tuned to your program.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Programmers write programs for self education and fun,</p>\n  <p>but when it comes to large applications, learn from the success of the World Encyclopedia.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div

<p>But I can show you how to do it in such a way,</p>\n  <p>so that other programmers may join you for fun or some meaningful reward.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Whatever it is build it a page at a time,</p>\n  <p>combine WikiWiki with BDD, maybe MUD, and make the story more important than the code as demonstrated by <a

and incompetent questions,\nwill only ask you to explain the programs you created.\n\nYou will get to talk about challenges you faced,\nand proudly explain solutions you implemented or invented.\n\nA real resume does not feature boilerplate clams,\nof how you deliver \"on time and under budget\".\n\nAnd you probably shouldn't mention that you went to school to learn,\nif you need someone to push you along to learn, then you will probably need someone to push you along to work.\n\nA real resume is just a list of programs you created,\nwith a short description about the brilliant ideas within.\n\nThis also protects you from toxic environments that will destroy your creativity,\na company that looks for a cookie cutter resume, is full of cookie cutter people, which is terrifying.\n\nThis is a big and in some cases controversial subject,\nso let me give you a real world case.\n\nEric Steven Raymond, the person behind the Jargon File, a Hacker's Dictionary,\nstates the following in the Education Section of his Resume:\n\n\"Education\nUndergraduate studies (including some graduate-level courses) in mathematics and philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania.\nI have never taken any courses in computer science or software engineering.\"\n\nPart of the reason why he says that,\nis to protect his hard work, he doesn't want people to think that he got his education from some mediocre minimum viable lowest-common-denominator classroom, and a teacher with little real-world experience.\n\nThe fact schools don't work very well, if at all, is not a secret,\nit is in fact the reason behind insulting and idiotic interview questions.\n\nThe fact that we are each extremely intelligent, and that we are each perfectly capable of becoming a humble Polymath,\nis inescapable.\n\nAnd that is what a competent employer would look for,\na balanced view of the world born from being a jack of all trades and a master of those that are interesting.\n\nSo,\nHow do you become good on your own...\n\nYou look at the top existing programs,\nand try to make smaller versions.\n\nThis will help you establish a baseline,\nthe baseline is the common industry standard, and in this day and age it means use a popular framework or the bare-bones, that whatever system you are working with is handing you.\n\nFor example, Bootstrap the Graphic User Interface library I use,\nused to rely on jQuery when jQuery was popular and necessary, but as browsers became more sophisticated, they rejected using jQuery and other frameworks, and just used the bare bones of the browser.\n\nThey are a fair baseline for industry standard web interface design,\nand they hold all the answers as far as a basic standard web interface is concerned.\n\nTo lean from them,\nmeans to create a tiny clone of their work, your own take on Bootstrap.\n\nEach time you get stuck,\nyou go to their website and look up how they did it.\n\nSince both of you at this point are working on the same thing,\nthey have answers to all your questions.\n\nYou can make your version perfect,\ncreating a Sandalstrap, a more lightweight version of Bootstrap, and that would be one of the items on your resume.\n\nOr you can make a messy version,\nwhere you purely go for the meat of the system, so your program will barely work, but as you file it away to some dusty git repository in hopes of never receiving a bug fix request, you walk away perfectly knowledgeable.\n\nAnd then you go a step higher,\nyou search around for people who used a modern framework to enhance the modernized Bootstrap.\n\nOne such project is the BootstrapVue,\nwhich relies on Vue.js for enhancing Bootstrap.\n\nAnother is Sveltestrap,\nwhich relies on Svelte.\n\nProgramming with Vue.js, Svelte, React, Angular, will give the ability to create web-application,\nand between knowing bare-bones, and the large modern framework, you cannot help but to become good.\n\nYou are likely to end up with several simple and beautiful applications,\nmaybe tiny websites that bring in a few dollars, and this then becomes an item on your resume.\n\nImagine an interview where instead of answering stupid and incompetent questions,\nyou demo your favorite applications and give an overview of several more.\n\nYou learn the bare bones by making your own little versions,\nand you learn the high end, by working with those frameworks to make interesting little apps.\n\nNow imagine how useful it would be if you had a Video Version of you demoing your apps,\nthat you could attach to your resume-portfolio.\n\nNobody is going to ask you if you know OOP, or if you can doodle a user interface layout system media query extravaganza on the white board,\nwhen it is already something that you cover in your video, and clearly feel passionate about.\n\nIt takes a long time to figure all this out,\nand you are learning so many subjects subjects at the same time, that school at this point seems like a joke.\n\nYou would need a couple of decades worth of classes moving at a snail pace,\nand even the programs at prestigious universities are off, where they still mention things that are irrelevant and would actually make your software slow had you employed them.\n\nHealthcare website launch problems in 2013 were not just about politics and bureaucracy,\nbut useless and outdated technologies and methods, probably the stuff they teach in school.\n\nJust the fact alone that many files were being loaded by the browser on launch day,\ninstead of organized into one or two compressed and bundled extras, reveals inexperienced programmers.\n\nThese lessons can't be emphasized correctly in a school environment,\nthey come precisely from places like the Bootstrap code base.\n\nIt takes 10 minutes to figure it out,\nand a few hours to start using mini-fication in all your programs.\n\nAnd that is it,\nthere is no lecture, no test here, it just becomes obvious and useful.\n\nWhen you care about learning,\nwhich is what happens when you are learning things you like, you never need to memorize, or put mini-fication on a todo, you just accept it as reality, and a great idea.\n\nI mention the failure of the 2013 Healthcare website,\nbecause it shows that a college education, and working for prestigious companies, on prestigious projects means nothing.\n\nReality makes it so that fake education,\ncan only lead to failure.\n\nThere isn't a textbook, or a teacher that can emphasize the important things enough,\nit has to be practice.\n\nThis is why Eric Raymond stands up for his Self Education,\nit is the difference between Real Education and Fantasy Education.\n\nReading and learning from source code and then writing your own programs,\nis the only realistic way to learn programming for real.\n\nAnd you are genius level smart, we all are, but you have to start with baby steps,\nit has to be a very comfortable on-ramp, don't start by learning CSS nobody does that, start with what you like and then look at other projects to see how you can make it better.\n\nIf you ever get stuck, or are unsure where to go next, or aren't sure where to begin,\nthen go to a video search box type in the thing that interests you the most followed by the word tutorial.\n\nSeeing and hearing many different perspectives from different people will help you balance your understanding,\nand find your next step.\n\nSearch for tutorials,\ndo it, it will be amazing!\n\n\n[Jargon File]: http://catb.org/jargon/\n[Resume]:

knowledgeable.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And then you go a step higher,</p>\n  <p>you search around for people who used a modern framework to enhance the modernized Bootstrap.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>One such project is the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DyKeMa5tYY&amp;t=74s\">BootstrapVue</a>,</p>\n  <p>which relies on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK6F5GGldPM\">Vue.js</a> for enhancing Bootstrap.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Another is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3J1qTQ7kC8\">Sveltestrap</a>,</p>\n  <p>which relies on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ws97Etvs-Qs\">Svelte</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Programming with Vue.js, Svelte, React, Angular, will give the ability to create web-application,</p>\n  <p>and between knowing bare-bones, and the large modern framework, you cannot help but to become good.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You are likely to end up with several simple and beautiful applications,</p>\n  <p>maybe tiny websites that bring in a few dollars, and this then becomes an item on your resume.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Imagine an interview where instead of answering stupid and incompetent questions,</p>\n  <p>you demo your favorite applications and give an overview of several more.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You learn the bare bones by making your own little versions,</p>\n  <p>and you learn the high end, by working with those frameworks to make interesting little apps.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Now imagine how useful it would be if you had a Video Version of you demoing your apps,</p>\n  <p>that you could attach to your resume-portfolio.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Nobody is going to ask you if you know OOP, or if you can doodle a user interface layout system media query extravaganza on the white board,</p>\n  <p>when it is already something that you cover in your video, and clearly feel passionate about.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It takes a long time to figure all this out,</p>\n  <p>and you are learning so many subjects subjects at the same time, that school at this point seems like a joke.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You would need a couple of decades worth of classes moving at a snail pace,</p>\n  <p>and even the programs at prestigious universities are off, where they still mention things that are irrelevant and would actually make your software slow had you employed them.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3M8O83n254\">Healthcare website launch problems in 2013</a> were not just about politics and bureaucracy,</p>\n  <p>but useless and outdated technologies and methods, probably the stuff they teach in school.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Just the fact alone that many files were being loaded by the browser on launch day,</p>\n  <p>instead of organized into one or two compressed and bundled extras, reveals inexperienced programmers.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>These lessons can&apos;t be emphasized correctly in a school environment,</p>\n  <p>they come precisely from places like the Bootstrap code base.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It takes 10 minutes to figure it out,</p>\n  <p>and a few hours to start using mini-fication in all your programs.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And that is it,</p>\n  <p>there is no lecture, no test here, it just becomes obvious and useful.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>When you care about learning,</p>\n  <p>which is what happens when you are learning things you like, you never need to memorize, or put mini-fication on a todo, you just accept it as reality, and a great idea.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I mention the failure of the 2013 Healthcare website,</p>\n  <p>because it shows that a college education, and working for prestigious companies, on prestigious projects means nothing.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Reality makes it so that fake education,</p>\n  <p>can only lead to failure.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>There isn&apos;t a textbook, or a teacher that can emphasize the important things enough,</p>\n  <p>it has to be practice.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>This is why Eric Raymond stands up for his Self Education,</p>\n  <p>it is the difference between Real Education and Fantasy Education.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Reading and learning from source code and then writing your own programs,</p>\n  <p>is the only realistic way to learn programming for real.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQPEZdBTOeE\">And you are genius level smart, we all are, but you have to start with baby steps</a>,</p>\n  <p>it has to be a very comfortable on-ramp, don&apos;t start by learning CSS nobody does that, start with what you like and then look at other projects to see how you can make it better.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If you ever get stuck, or are unsure where to go next, or aren&apos;t sure where to begin,</p>\n  <p>then go to a video search box type in the thing that interests you the most followed by the word tutorial.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Seeing and hearing many different perspectives from different people will help you balance your understanding,</p>\n  <p>and find your next step.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Search for tutorials,</p>\n  <p>do it, it

      "text": "Being a good programmer is very easy,\nif you keep everything in order.\n\nIt gets even easier when you program for yourself,\nyou become a master of your world of little machines.\n\nThings get difficult when too many machines,\nstart biting each other, this has been called Leaky Abstractions.\n\nYou can think of things inside a program as machines,\nsome machines move objects that have named values.\n\nFox example a commonly used object is User,\nthe name of a commonly used value is email, and value of email is user@example.com\n\nSuch an object can be passed through a machine that detects bad email addresses,\nexample.com is a special fake domain name, so it is a bad email address.\n\nWhen detected, the entire user object will be bounced, or sent, of copied over,\nto a program that suspends accounts, prevents the user with that email from longing in.\n\nWhen you fill out a login form on a website,\nyou create a short lived login object, that goes into a system of such little machines.\n\nThere could be a machine that has a list of bad emails that will CRUSH! this packet,\nand sent an error object back to the login page.\n\nOr there could be a machine that right before password verification,\nchecks if the user is suspended, and will just say \"Invalid Password\" instead.\n\nIf all you ever do is deal with these little object-passing machines,\nthen that means you are a pretty good programmer.\n\nBut when you search for a job,\npeople will try to force you to know 50 different things.\n\nNo one should tell you what you should excel at,\nor define what programming should consist of.\n\nNor are you allowed to focus on memorizing answers to those questions,\nbecause to really know an answer you have to encounter and solve the problem yourself.\n\nIn the course of you mastery of programming,\nyou will bump into every interview question there is inside out.\n\nInterviews are strange things, because you can build your own Object Oriented Language,\nand when asked about Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction, and Inheritance not recognize it as a definition of Object Oriented Programming.\n\nA definition using those four beautiful words is found in a school text book,\nif you don't associate those four words with OOP by having encountered them in a text book, you will fail the question.\n\nEven if you build you own OOP systems, and especially if you frequently employ Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction, and Inheritance\nthough other means, such as Event Oriented Programming, or Aspect Oriented Programming, Or Agent Oriented Programming.\n\nFailing an interview does not make you a bad programmer,\nit makes you an expert in things that they can't conceive of.\n\nDo you understand what this means,\nyou can't expect schools to teach you.\n\nWhat schools teach will make a mess out of you,\nyou have to learn on your own.\n\nThe machines have to be yours,\nto connect together.\n\nYou must become a Rōnin Samurai,\nmake people confused, embarrassed, maybe even angry.\n\nThe point of programming is not to get a job,\nit is to change the world.\n\nThe nay sayers will check me here,\nwhat good is a programmer that knows not how to operate DOM, or CouchDB or SQL.\n\nBut the answers is, my dear critic,\nwhat good are you for knowing those things.\n\nNo good at all,\nit is all in your head.\n\nThere are just two types of databases, in-memory, and on file system,\nif you combine the two together and prefix it with a append only log, you'll have all you need.\n\nKeep your indexes in memory, name your directories after record id like in CouchDB,\nand updates with a version-number and a UUID so that they may be saved into that folder without overwriting anything.\n\nConflict resolution is achieved by looking at the UUID,\njust a simple sort on the UUID gives you the winner and thus eventual consistency.\n\nThen just sync servers with rsync,\nremember all file names are named with a random UUID in it, no data will ever be overwritten, just updated.\n\nNay sayers, critics, benchmark sticklers, and ACID Database Test lovers,\ngo home, eat your vegetables, and drink plenty of water.\n\nIn the world of programming you are always correct,\nbecause it is a world of your own making.\n\nYou are the creator of your software,\nand you also the hacker, the tester, and the administrator.\n\nIt is easy to grasp what you have invented,\nand use what you have invented to understand, reverse engineer, and infer other technologies.\n\nYour greatest power is simplicity and order,\nlearn from Ward Cunningham.\n\nMr. Cunningham connected WikiWikiWeb pages by removing spaces between capitalized words,\nif something was camel case, it would immediately become a link to a page named after those smushed words.\n\nThe only thing you needed to link pages together was: capitalizing the words you wanted to make a link out of, and removing spaces between them,\nsystem would detect an uppercase letter in the middle of a word, and turn it into a hyperlink to another page.\n\nAnd best of all, if that page did not exist,\nit would say \"Hey there, stranger, this page does not exist yet, why don't you create it.\"\n\nMr. Cunningham mentions the HyperCard,\nand yes, HyperCard is a wonderful idea.\n\nThis is what being a programmer means,\nyou start with node or electron , and your first line of code, and then you move on to OOP or EventEmitter.\n\nCreate your first Game, WikiWikiWeb, MUD, or even Interactive Fiction Adventure,\nor a bot, or a music programming environment.\n\nSo as long as you create your own systems,\nwithin your own realm, you will never get lost, and you will never stop learning about everything else.\n\nProgrammers are both Rōnin Samurai, and Real Magicians,\nthey are unafraid to cast spells and build worlds, and create universes.\n\n\n[Leaky Abstractions]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRsyY0kzXfw\n[people will try to

in other words self-forgiveness.\n\nHere the least fortunate of The Human Family,\nstill need a way out of poverty.\n\nThere needs to be a program on the tablet,\nthat will both protect the assets they create, and help them create more.\n\nFor many that tablet will represent the work of a lifetime,\nthe full measure, of the hope, in their new and better future.\n\nWhatever happens on that tablet,\nmust be safe from fellow inmates, prison employees, and crooked politicians and presidents.\n\nWe can all be sure,\nthat things that do represent monetary value, require study; and the more one learns the easier it gets.\n\nThe simplest and safest asset a person under attack can keep,\nis knowledge learned.\n\nFor example, if the tablet was to teach how to write computer programs,\nhow to design user interfaces, efficient web servers, secure networks.\n\nThat person would be able to leave their past behind,\nand build a company, perhaps with colleagues from the same environment.\n\nThis is not the same as going to school, or even going to business school,\nthis the study and assembly of a ready to go development house.\n\nThe tablet would contain a simulated, ready to go business,\nwith real case studies, and projects.\n\nIn a safer environment, where it is possible to open a bank account,\nwhere one can be reasonably sure that what lite money they have will not be taken away.\n\nA planet wide market,\nwhere people create digital goods.\n\nA program architecture that relies on the human mind,\nwhere a person is answering simple questions to build a unique and greater whole that will help them out of poverty.\n\nAnd while this would be too cumbersome for one individual,\nit would be doable for a network of thousands, or perhaps billions of people fighting their way out of poverty.\n\nWhere prison offers time to practice,\nthe world of the streets requires an instant trickle of money.\n\nAnd this income must absolutely require,\nthe best and most creative that the human mind can produce.\n\nThis way world's Corrupt Politicians will not be able to force the homeless to slave for them,\nit has to be more meaningful work than training neural networks.\n\nWe can convert prisons to Start-up Accelerators,\nthat will emerge companies ready to accept clients.\n\nBut helping people who don't have a roof over their head,\nwho don't have rations waiting for them, must include instant money.\n\nIt is not just a man on a plastic chair,\nit is also the woman who has nowhere left to go.\n\nWhat is on the tablet that helps her pay for the apartment,\nand it isn't just random noise, but something meaningful, that adds up to create a greater whole.\n\nBecause if we can help those two,\ngo to pay rent, and buy a house, and a car and then make it a home.\n\nThen we will have ended poverty,\nnot just for those two, but for the world over.",

      "text": "The Trembling Giant is a clonal colony of aspen determined to be a single living organism,\nand assumed to have one massive underground root system, it contains 47,000 trees.\n\nThis text is about taking your first beautiful company,\nwith an imaginative and eye catching product...\n\nAnd then making a much more powerful business out of it,\nby selling its clones to many business people.\n\nWhere your original product sold for $29.99,\nthe clones of companies that make that product will bring you a much greater figure.\n\nA company represents a dream, people will pay for the upfront setup,\nand then pay you monthly until the company is fully paid off.\n\nSo you go from $29.99 to relatively impossibly-large-figures,\nby simply abandoning your product and selling copies of your company.\n\nNow, here a hardened business person will check me,\nno doubt to share a wisdom valuable for brick and mortar shops.\n\nAnd here comes the first warning, do not open a physical location,\nand don't deal with anything that requires a warehouse.\n\nLet me make that clear, no physical goods, no building improvements and remodeling, no cleaning supplies, no employee uniforms,\nno equipment repairs and maintenance, no HVAC maintenance, no miscellaneous supplies, no mortgage or lease payments, no physical location,\nno signage, no utilities; or it will bleed you dry and push you into a bankruptcy (which is much better than school loans)\n\nDo not create a business that will consume your company,\nif it stops making money for a few months.\n\nYou have to create a machine that only comes to life when a sale is made,\nthat only extracts fees from a ready made sale.\n\nRemember, you are selling copies of this company,\nyour customers should only see a simple relationship between advertising and sales, that is it.\n\nThe company must be easily operated via the internet,\nand as 2020 taught us great emphasis should be placed on telecommuting, or remote jobs.\n\nArtificial Intelligence is not going to get here any time soon,\nif anything AI is just a stupid trick that corporations use to cut expenses by replacing employees with touchscreens for customers.\n\nAnd AI can only emerge of out accidents,\nit will not be a system that will be able to improve it self, it will never know how it works.\n\nThere are Eight Billion People out there,\nan you are building a lightweight company that only calls for employees when something needs to be done.\n\nThis could mean that the company goes dormant during incompatible times,\nor that you keep employing more and more and more and more, but only when there is more and more work to be done.\n\nAs the job queue becomes smaller,\nthe number of workers you employ in your template company will scale down.\n\nOnce you sell 1,000 such companies, 1,000 copies of that original,\nthe regulars won't really care if they are working for a clone in Bangalore, Johannesburg, or Rio.\n\nPremature optimization and automation is your friend,\nsqueeze everything down to the most robotic and lightweight implementation.\n\nThat will be your seed,\nyou will now be able to see what is constricting it.\n\nToo much automation, not enough variability,\nimpossible growth due to over optimization in a particular fragment.\n\nAll of these anomalies reveal pathways towards growth,\nand whatever does function in its lightweight mode can only make the company better.\n\nLet us look at that original business, the template,\nif that is all you wanted to build, you would aim for something that makes more than $10,000 month.\n\nBut now that you are building a network of clones,\nyou have to ask how much does a clone-company like that need-to-make-a-month to sell well.\n\nIt could be 1,000 with minimal advertising,\nthere are millions of people in this world who would be happy to make 1,000 a month.\n\nHow much should you sell a 1,000 a month company for,\nmaybe $24,000, maybe $50,000.\n\nAnd how are those people going to pay that sum?\nnow listen carefully.\n\nYou are not allowed to put people desperate for money,\nin more debt, the banks that used to do that employed the worst kinds of human beings.\n\nThey will pay you with a fair percent of their monthly income,\nif $100 is all they will make on that particular month, then all you will get is a $10 towards that $24,000.\n\nMake sure to hold up the banks that stole whatever money poor people had left,\nas an example of who not to do business with.\n\nSee TCF Bank tricked customers into expensive overdrafts, federal agency says, TCF experiments with new overdraft fee policy,\nand CFPB’s TCF Bank Overdraft Fee Case Has Echoes of Wells Fargo’s Fraud\n\nIn the end, come your age of wisdom, building a company that does nothing to help poor people,\nis not worth your time.\n\nThat clever $1 down to trap a person into a legally binding contract,\nis a disgrace, an insult, and just as predatory as relying on bounced checks and other customer fees for a big share of your profits.\n\nNow, the easy part,\nas to the structure of your company...\n\nDon't invent anything new,\nclone what others wish they could own.\n\nAfter all, your business is about selling clones of a fetching company,\nand later on, about letting your clients pick from many templates of successful companies.\n\nI am convinced many of your clients will own multiple clones,\nand they will use them to reinforce one another.\n\nOn the front-end, are things that make the customer of a clone company happy,\non the back-end is the administrator zone, AND! a place for freelancers to perform whatever actions the company needs to grow.\n\nFor example, imagine City Photography, Inc,\nwhich is patterned after Unsplash owned by two teenager co-founders.\n\nThey are coordinating photography projects from all the cities in United States,\nall the photographs are free to use without registration, the participating photographers, can win awards, get a beautiful portfolio and job experience.\n\nThis company makes money from product and business placement,\nfrom the brand names that models wear, and the cars that appear in exclusive photos.\n\nThese two teenagers, want to photograph all the landmarks in United States,\nand they can achieve that by putting a small monetary bounty on particular landmarks.\n\nThey may request slow motion video, time lapse photography, tilt shift photography,\nareal drone photography, and set the bounties as needed.\n\nOver time, they will discover more ways of monetizing,\nbecause monetization depends on their users.\n\nFor example, City Photography, Inc can allow its users to give each other Monetary Tips, including monthly,\nand then take a small percentage of that, this would represent maybe 5% of their moneymaking.\n\nThere would be many more ways that City Photography, Inc takes an unobtrusive cut of something,\nthis may include brand names advertising their labels on the front page, popular users paying for a spotlight and so on.\n\nCity Photography, Inc may grow, it maybe purchased by a larger company as the case it with Unsplash,\nor it may fade away releasing all its photographs to Web Archive, or similar under the Public Domain license.\n\nThe number one deciding factor for what will happen to a company is the chaos and randomness of the business world,\nthe number two deciding factor is timing, if high quality photography is something that the world is interested in, then they will thrive.\n\nThe end of life for City Photography, Inc,\nis just a new beginning for out two co-founders, no longer teenagers now, but just as sharp and passionate about business and big dreams.\n\nThey will take to another type of business you sell,\nas they will now be intricately familiar with what it is like to engage in running a company, with a remote-work back-end that cater to freelancers around the world.\n\nIn closing,\ncreate a beautiful little company, have fun with it, and when you are done covert it into a template,\nand begin selling clones of that company to others.\n\nDon't stop here, look to other businesses that are fun to use, launch, run,\nand copy them, bring in their template into your system so that people that buy companies from you can have multiple choices.\n\nAnd don't be evil, don't bother with companies that do nothing for those who live in poverty,\nthey are not worth your time.\n\nCome your final days, no matter how many times you will say to yourself \"I made a difference\",\nyou will never fully believe it, unless you truly did make a different, unless you truly did grow to become a Great Being that helped the world grow.\n\n\n[the company goes dormant

class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In the end, come your age of wisdom, building a company that does nothing to help poor people,</p>\n  <p>is not worth your time.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>That clever $1 down to trap a person into a legally binding contract,</p>\n  <p>is a disgrace, an insult, and just as predatory as relying on bounced checks and other customer fees for a big share of your profits.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<p>Now, the easy part,</p>\n<p>as to the structure of your company...</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Don&apos;t invent anything new,</p>\n  <p>clone what others wish they could own.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>After all, your business is about selling clones of a fetching company,</p>\n  <p>and later on, about letting your clients pick from many templates of successful companies.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I am convinced many of your clients will own multiple clones,</p>\n  <p>and they will use them to reinforce one another.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>On the front-end, are things that make the customer of a clone company happy,</p>\n  <p>on the back-end is the administrator zone, AND! a place for freelancers to perform whatever actions the company needs to grow.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>For example, imagine City Photography, Inc,</p>\n  <p>which is patterned after <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/\">Unsplash</a> owned by two teenager co-founders.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>They are coordinating photography projects from all the cities in United States,</p>\n  <p>all the photographs are free to use without registration, the participating photographers, can win awards, get a beautiful portfolio and job experience.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>This company makes money from product and business placement,</p>\n  <p>from the brand names that models wear, and the cars that appear in exclusive photos.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>These two teenagers, want to photograph all the landmarks in United States,</p>\n  <p>and they can achieve that by putting a small monetary bounty on particular landmarks.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>They may request slow motion video, time lapse photography, tilt shift photography,</p>\n  <p>areal drone photography, and set the bounties as needed.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Over time, they will discover more ways of monetizing,</p>\n  <p>because monetization depends on their users.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>For example, City Photography, Inc can allow its users to give each other Monetary Tips, including monthly,</p>\n  <p>and then take a small percentage of that, this would represent maybe 5% of their moneymaking.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>There would be many more ways that City Photography, Inc takes an unobtrusive cut of something,</p>\n  <p>this may include brand names advertising their labels on the front page, popular users paying for a spotlight and so on.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>City Photography, Inc may grow, it maybe purchased by a larger company as the case it with Unsplash,</p>\n  <p>or it may fade away releasing all its photographs to Web Archive, or similar under the Public Domain license.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The number one deciding factor for what will happen to a company is the chaos and randomness of the business world,</p>\n  <p>the number two deciding factor is timing, if high quality photography is something that the world is interested in, then they will thrive.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The end of life for City Photography, Inc,</p>\n  <p>is just a new beginning for out two co-founders, no longer teenagers now, but just as sharp and passionate about business and big dreams.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>They will take to another type of business you sell,</p>\n  <p>as they will now be intricately familiar with what it is like to engage in running a company, with a remote-work back-end that cater to freelancers around the world.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In closing,</p>\n  <p>create a beautiful little company, have fun with it, and when you are done covert it into a template,</p>\n  <p>and begin selling clones of that company to others.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Don&apos;t stop here, look to other businesses that are fun to use, launch, run,</p>\n  <p>and copy them, bring in their template into your system so that people that buy companies from you can have multiple choices.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And don&apos;t be evil, don&apos;t bother with companies that do nothing for those who live in poverty,</p>\n  <p>they are not worth your time.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Come your final days, no matter how many times you will say to yourself &quot;I made a difference&quot;,</p>\n  <p>you will never fully believe it, unless you truly did make a different, unless you truly did grow to become a Great Being that helped the world grow.</p>\n</div>",

      "text": "I know this sounds like basic advice,\nbut this is tough.\n\nSchool was double trouble for me,\nnot only was it nonsense, but it also came with bullies.\n\nIt was dangerous, so I stopped going,\nit never occurred to me to call the police.\n\nI thought everyone was getting bullied,\nI didn't even complain to the school.\n\nI didn't complain about my bad grades in programming,\nthe teacher marked me down because he got angry that I was copying.\n\nIt never occurred to me to go to the principal,\nthe bullies were already laughing.\n\nThere was this short kid getting beaten up,\nand I tried to push away his bully.\n\nWho was an A student,\nand an addict.\n\nNot only did the two turn on me,\nbut my main bully joined in two.\n\nI don't fight,\nbecause that would only make me a bully.\n\nBut, when I am in danger,\neveryone is going to be pushed away.\n\nThe fight came to an abrupt end,\nas my bully was already hurt, probably from his father.\n\nSO the teachers got around,\nfor the first time in five years bullying was noticed.\n\nExcept that when I got back to my classroom,\nthe smartest of the girls, told me that they don't want me there anymore.\n\nJust about at the same moment,\nthe school shrink came in, put her hand on my shoulder and said everything is OK.\n\nThe two that originally started the fight,\nbegun lying that I started the fight.\n\nI told the psychologist to grill them until they start telling the truth,\nand she finally got the real story out of them.\n\nAnd they got punished,\nI didn't do anything wrong other than pushing my bullies away.\n\nEach of them, including the little one tried to fight me before,\nI still didn't want the little guy to get beaten up, I know what it is like.\n\nFew days later, my main bully, invited college kids to teach me a lesson,\nthey actually came into to the school.\n\nI did not see the kick,\nhe must have been standing behind me.\n\nI didn't really get hurt,\nbut I stayed on the ground to be safe.\n\nThe Russian language teacher saw me down,\nand didn't do anything.\n\nWhen I made it to class,\nthe bully that invited the older boys to teach me a lesson, was laughing at me.\n\nI think the side of my face was red from the kick,\nthey would have been arrested if I knew to call the police.\n\nI am certain they had knives,\nthere were four to six of them, they had look outs by the stairs.\n\nMy main bully was lying that I was beating him up,\nit was either because his father was abusing him.\n\nOr because his father was teaching him to shit on other people,\nhe was telling his kid how to destroy me.\n\nSince I assumed this always happens to everyone,\nI was fine, a little lonely.\n\nAfter the big bullies came,\nit was dangerous to go back to school.\n\nSo I went the other way,\nwisely.\n\nI saw my main bully watching me,\nwaiting for the buss that goes the other way.\n\nThey were jealous, they laughed,\nwho knows.\n\nTh first time I crossed the street to wait for the bus that goes the other way,\nmeant I dropped out of school.\n\nMy parents were already angry for me pushing bullies away,\nafter five years of taking their punches, but I didn't care.\n\nI was not a victim,\nI was a warrior.\n\nI won every one of those fights,\nby not hurting them back.\n\nEach time they came to attack me,\nI became stronger, nobler, more powerful, smarter, more independent.\n\nIsolation didn't hurt me either,\nall I ever knew was bullying, and being alone, I used to enjoy it.\n\nI had a Commodore 64, and I used Simon's Basic to teach myself about pixels,\nI never liked playing computer games, I still don't.\n\nBut, I kept current, with every major game release,\nI carefully paid attention, to the pixels.\n\nXXXX Souls games are my favorite, of course,\nnever payed them but they are each a masterpiece.\n\nThat where the buss took me,\nit took me into the world of Pixel Art.\n\nIt was an old underground World War 2 bunker,\nthat was filled with Arcade Games.\n\nIf I didn't go back to school,\nXXXX I would have been coding my own intros, I would have become part of the demo scene.\n\nI would have mastered it all,\nbut I went back, but it took the teachers four months to catch on that I was gone.\n\nFour amazing months,\nI never had the money to play games, I would only watch others play it.\n\nMy favorites were Asterix and The Simpsons by Konami,\nand Street Fighter II by Capcom.\n\nI also enjoyed Wonder Boy,\nI just think it is really neat.\n\nEven after I graduated that strange place,\nand went to a much nicer school bullies were there.\n\nThe older they get the creeper they become,\none kid actually freaked out, as I didn't pull my hand away, I bet he still remembers that smell.\n\nThe biggest bully there, that seemed like a normal person,\nwas actually a neo nazi, I wasn't scared but I kept my distance.\n\nIt was time to pack by that time,\nI ended up in Brooklyn, NY.\n\nAnd again, as I was waking back from school,\nthe local boxer kid, started punching me in the back of my head.\n\nBrooklyn was my home though,\nI called the police, I told them I would not press charges.\n\nWhile they said they couldn't do anything,\nthey were all gone.\n\nBefore I moved to the state I am in now,\nthe bully walked by me and using the F word explained that he does not like Poles, as in polish people.\n\nI was too scared to say anything,\nbut most of the polish people I knew were very cruel to me.\n\nI always tried to make friends,\nbut, it was difficult.\n\nThe part of me that made me win every fight without fighting,\nby being strong, and dignified.\n\nIs not comfortable around people that do alcohol, drugs,\nthat go to bars, and live in that creepy culture of get plastered, get stoned, get laid, get wasted, lie, cheat, and steal.\n\nI became strong, not by running away from fights,\nbut by not punching back, by taking the hardest path, and the easy roads are just not for me, they are frightening.\n\nI tried to help many people in my journeys,\nbut help must come from within.\n\nOne time I mumbled something about helping people a decade back, at a Chinese restaurant near by,\nand a lady almost yelled at me \"That is not your problem, not your responsibility.\"\n\nI admitted to her \"I know that now.\",\nbut before I thought we had to help each other.\n\nI never really helped anyone get out of any trouble,\nI think it was because I didn't look like a wise old man.\n\nNobody was listening to me,\nbut I tried!\n\nMy big advice, is to remember the Dean, the principal, the police,\ndon't let anybody push you around.\n\nIf you get an unfair grade,\ndon't just stand there like I did - go to the principal, and make yourself at home.\n\nIf you are too scared to speak, say so,\n\"I have trouble speaking because I am scared, please give me a moment to gather my thoughts.\"\n\nIf bullies come after you, you have to call the police, to help them,\nthe police needs to investigate their parents.\n\nNo child is born a bully, the worst of them are victims of abuse, if you get the police on it early,\nthen you maybe able to save your bullie's mind from permanent damage, where they stay a bully for life.\n\nMy last piece of advice is tough,\nif you drop out, that is life telling you that you don't belong there.\n\nSee, I went back to school because I was scared of becoming homeless,\nbut poverty is an error, it is not meant to be your driving force.\n\nPoverty is a mistake that Humanity didn't know it made,\npoverty is not your fault.\n\nYou have to fight the errors,\nyou have to challenge poverty with knowledge.\n\nNot spend your life time running away from it,\nor towards some stick and carrot promotion.\n\nIf the schools fail you,\nthen you go to the library.\n\nAudio Books started flourishing just about ten years ago,\nthis is the first time in Human history that we can really get into books, without any effort.\n\nDon't drop out completely,\nfor one the kids in the back row need to understand that they are not stupid, they are just too mature to memorize garbage.\n\nCall out the teachers,\nthe curriculum, write to the local newspaper.\n\nXXXX The Dean or Principal know that schools are bullshit,\nat the very least they owe you lunch.\n\nIf you just rise above the nonsense,\nthe constant memorization of noise, the overwhelming mediocrity.\n\nYour mind will grow,\nflourish.\n\nGet your mittens on all the books about education,\nmass incarceration, politics and corporate fraud, and try to figure out how everything works.\n\nIf your Biology teacher proclaims \"Weed to be an herb.\", like mine did,\ndon't just drop out like I did.\n\nGet up, and say \"Let's see what your employer has to say about that\",\ngo to the Principles office, and face the wrath that will come from it all.\n\nLearn to stand up for what is right,\nbecause this is your world, by the time you are their age they will have long retired, and will care even less.\n\nXXXX The world needs Heroes, those who stand up for truth,\nand learn to find entertainment in rage and anger that is causes.\n\nI didn't let years of bulling hurt me at all,\nI became stronger and wiser for it.\n\nIf misfortune finds you,\nrise up, back away, and forge your own path in life, aim away from mediocrity, and the easier wrong.\n\nMisfortune, especially one that you can't help, is good training,\nit will make you a ridiculously overpowered warrior, and a ridiculously cheerful one too.\n\nBesides, the moment you rise above your troubles,\nyou come into the company of all the great warriors an thinkers, prophets and philosophers, dreamers and artists that came before you.\n\nYou can't allow yourself to be stressed out by broken schools and equally broken bullies,\nor anything that is broken, that is not mean to drive you.\n\nThis is your life,\nand you are meant to bloom towards greatness.\n\nYou must not hide or run away from broken things,\nwe are all meant to become great beings.\n\nAnd if you become lonely, use that to your advantage too, take to the trails,\nand remember what Henry said.\n\n\"I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach,\nand not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.\nI did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary.\nI wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life,\nto cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms...\"\n\n\n[Souls

class=\"section\">\n  <p>The two that originally started the fight,</p>\n  <p>begun lying that I started the fight.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I told the psychologist to grill them until they start telling the truth,</p>\n  <p>and she finally got the real story out of them.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And they got punished,</p>\n  <p>I didn&apos;t do anything wrong other than pushing my bullies away.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Each of them, including the little one tried to fight me before,</p>\n  <p>I still didn&apos;t want the little guy to get beaten up, I know what it is like.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Few days later, my main bully, invited college kids to teach me a lesson,</p>\n  <p>they actually came into to the school.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I did not see the kick,</p>\n  <p>he must have been standing behind me.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I didn&apos;t really get hurt,</p>\n  <p>but I stayed on the ground to be safe.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The Russian language teacher saw me down,</p>\n  <p>and didn&apos;t do anything.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>When I made it to class,</p>\n  <p>the bully that invited the older boys to teach me a lesson, was laughing at me.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I think the side of my face was red from the kick,</p>\n  <p>they would have been arrested if I knew to call the police.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I am certain they had knives,</p>\n  <p>there were four to six of them, they had look outs by the stairs.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>My main bully was lying that I was beating him up,</p>\n  <p>it was either because his father was abusing him.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Or because his father was teaching him to shit on other people,</p>\n  <p>he was telling his kid how to destroy me.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Since I assumed this always happens to everyone,</p>\n  <p>I was fine, a little lonely.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>After the big bullies came,</p>\n  <p>it was dangerous to go back to school.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>So I went the other way,</p>\n  <p>wisely.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I saw my main bully watching me,</p>\n  <p>waiting for the buss that goes the other way.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>They were jealous, they laughed,</p>\n  <p>who knows.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Th first time I crossed the street to wait for the bus that goes the other way,</p>\n  <p>meant I dropped out of school.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>My parents were already angry for me pushing bullies away,</p>\n  <p>after five years of taking their punches, but I didn&apos;t care.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I was not a victim,</p>\n  <p>I was a warrior.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I won every one of those fights,</p>\n  <p>by not hurting them back.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Each time they came to attack me,</p>\n  <p>I became stronger, nobler, more powerful, smarter, more independent.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Isolation didn&apos;t hurt me either,</p>\n  <p>all I ever knew was bullying, and being alone, I used to enjoy it.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I had a Commodore 64, and I used Simon&apos;s Basic to teach myself about pixels,</p>\n  <p>I never liked playing computer games, I still don&apos;t.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But, I kept current, with every major game release,</p>\n  <p>I carefully paid attention, to the pixels.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>XXXX <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McXJj7sjcZ0\">Souls games</a> are my favorite, of course,</p>\n  <p>never payed them but they are each a masterpiece.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>That where the buss took me,</p>\n  <p>it took me into the world of Pixel Art.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It was an old underground World War 2 bunker,</p>\n  <p>that was filled with Arcade Games.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If I didn&apos;t go back to school,</p>\n  <p>XXXX <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFqBkSJOYOQ\">I would have been coding my own intros, I would have become part of the demo scene</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I would have mastered it all,</p>\n  <p>but I went back, but it took the teachers four months to catch on that I was gone.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Four amazing months,</p>\n  <p>I never had the money to play games, I would only watch others play it.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>My favorites were Asterix and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9DE-KyZnLc\">The Simpsons</a> by Konami,</p>\n  <p>and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI284D4y1q4\">Street Fighter II</a> by Capcom.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I also enjoyed <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lb_7PyfwbmU\">Wonder Boy</a>,</p>\n  <p>I just think it is really neat.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Even after I graduated that strange place,</p>\n  <p>and went to a much nicer school bullies were there.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The older they get the creeper they become,</p>\n  <p>one kid actually freaked out, as I didn&apos;t pull my hand away, I bet he still remembers that smell.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The biggest bully there, that seemed like a normal person,</p>\n  <p>was actually a neo nazi, I wasn&apos;t scared but I kept my distance.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It was time to pack by that time,</p>\n  <p>I ended up in Brooklyn, NY.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And again, as I was waking back from school,</p>\n  <p>the local boxer kid, started punching me in the back of my head.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Brooklyn was my home though,</p>\n  <p>I called the police, I told them I would not press charges.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>While they said they couldn&apos;t do anything,</p>\n  <p>they were all gone.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Before I moved to the state I am in now,</p>\n  <p>the bully walked by me and using the F word explained that he does not like Poles, as in polish people.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I was too scared to say anything,</p>\n  <p>but most of the polish people I knew were very cruel to me.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I always tried to make friends,</p>\n  <p>but, it was difficult.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The part of me that made me win every fight without fighting,</p>\n  <p>by being strong, and dignified.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Is not comfortable around people that do alcohol, drugs,</p>\n  <p>that go to bars, and live in that creepy culture of get plastered, get stoned, get laid, get wasted, lie, cheat, and steal.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I became strong, not by running away from fights,</p>\n  <p>but by not punching back, by taking the hardest path, and the easy roads are just not for me, they are frightening.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I tried to help many people in my journeys,</p>\n  <p>but help must come from within.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>One time I mumbled something about helping people a decade back, at a Chinese restaurant near by,</p>\n  <p>and a lady almost yelled at me &quot;That is not your problem, not your responsibility.&quot;</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I admitted to her &quot;I know that now.&quot;,</p>\n  <p>but before I thought we had to help each other.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I never really helped anyone get out of any trouble,</p>\n  <p>I think it was because I didn&apos;t look like a wise old man.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Nobody was listening to me,</p>\n  <p>but I tried!</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>My big advice, is to remember the Dean, the principal, the police,</p>\n  <p>don&apos;t let anybody push you around.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If you get an unfair grade,</p>\n  <p>don&apos;t just stand there like I did - go to the principal, and make yourself at home.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If you are too scared to speak, say so,</p>\n  <p>&quot;I have trouble speaking because I am scared, please give me a moment to gather my thoughts.&quot;</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If bullies come after you, you have to call the police, to help them,</p>\n  <p>the police needs to investigate their parents.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>No child is born a bully, the worst of them are victims of abuse, if you get the police on it early,</p>\n  <p>then you maybe able to save your bullie&apos;s mind from permanent damage, where they stay a bully for life.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>My last piece of advice is tough,</p>\n  <p>if you drop out, that is life telling you that you don&apos;t belong there.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>See, I went back to school because I was scared of becoming homeless,</p>\n  <p>but poverty is an error, it is not meant to be your driving force.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Poverty is a mistake that Humanity didn&apos;t know it made,</p>\n  <p>poverty is not your fault.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You have to fight the errors,</p>\n  <p>you have to challenge poverty with knowledge.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Not spend your life time running away from it,</p>\n  <p>or towards some stick and carrot promotion.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If the schools fail you,</p>\n  <p>then you go to the library.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Audio Books started flourishing just about ten years ago,</p>\n  <p>this is the first time in Human history that we can really get into books, without any effort.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Don&apos;t drop out completely,</p>\n  <p>for one the kids in the back row need to understand that they are not stupid, they are just too mature to memorize garbage.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Call out the teachers,</p>\n  <p>the curriculum, write to the local newspaper.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>XXXX <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmoor8DwqW4\">The Dean or Principal know that schools are bullshit</a>,</p>\n  <p>at the very least they owe you lunch.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If you just rise above the nonsense,</p>\n  <p>the constant memorization of noise, the overwhelming mediocrity.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Your mind will grow,</p>\n  <p>flourish.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Get your mittens on all the books about education,</p>\n  <p>mass incarceration, politics and corporate fraud, and try to figure out how everything works.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If your Biology teacher proclaims &quot;Weed to be an herb.&quot;, like mine did,</p>\n  <p>don&apos;t just drop out like I did.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Get up, and say &quot;Let&apos;s see what your employer has to say about that&quot;,</p>\n  <p>go to the Principles office, and face the wrath that will come from it all.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Learn to stand up for what is right,</p>\n  <p>because this is your world, by the time you are their age they will have long retired, and will care even less.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>XXXX <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWQq0E8ENSc\">The world needs Heroes</a>, those who stand up for truth,</p>\n  <p>and learn to find entertainment in rage and anger that is causes.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I didn&apos;t let years of bulling hurt me at all,</p>\n  <p>I became stronger and wiser for it.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If misfortune finds you,</p>\n  <p>rise up, back away, and forge your own path in life, aim away from mediocrity, and the easier wrong.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Misfortune, especially one that you can&apos;t help, is good training,</p>\n  <p>it will make you a ridiculously overpowered warrior, and a ridiculously cheerful one too.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Besides, the moment you rise above your troubles,</p>\n  <p>you come into the company of all the great warriors an thinkers, prophets and philosophers, dreamers and artists that came before you.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You can&apos;t allow yourself to be stressed out by broken schools and equally broken bullies,</p>\n  <p>or anything that is broken, that is not mean to drive you.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>This is your life,</p>\n  <p>and you are meant to bloom towards greatness.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You must not hide or run away from broken things,</p>\n  <p>we are all meant to become great beings.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And if you become lonely, use that to your advantage too, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPSvdKTEZug\">take to the trails</a>,</p>\n  <p>and remember what Henry said.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>&quot;I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach,</p>\n  <p>and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.</p>\n  <p>I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary.</p>\n  <p>I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life,</p>\n  <p>to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms...&quot;</p>\n</div>",
