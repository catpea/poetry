        <p>We must make time, to enlarge our view,<br>
          and in everything we do, we must first think things through.</p>
        <p>Above all, to thine own self be true,<br>
          but also your own world, should fit like a good shoe.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>With each step you took your mind grew,<br>
          with all new things, we never really start anew.</p>
        <p>Where ever we go, whatever we go through,<br>
          we learn and our wisdom evolves, as we continue.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Sure, sometimes it feels like we don&apos;t know what to do,<br>
          but when you get sad, the whole Universe becomes slightly more blue,</p>
        <p>We may not know exactly what you are going through,<br>
          but many of us have been there, we too got stuck until we grew.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Many great beings get hurt, but all plow on through,<br>
          you are not alone, in our own thoughts, we sit right next to you.</p>
        <p>Please push trough the pain, and look through the zoo,<br>
          when all is writ, and said and done, we all still need you,</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>There is a blinding beauty to who you already are - I wish you knew,<br>
          with each step forward, you become a brighter star, and we love you.</p>
        <p>Don&apos;t worry, so as long as to your own self you stay true,<br>
          it will all pass, and when looking back you&apos;ll say - &quot;I Grew.&quot;</p>
