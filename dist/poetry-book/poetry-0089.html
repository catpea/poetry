        <p>Your superpowers are not rooted in your wishes,<br>
          as only very few wishes come true.</p>
        <p>Universe has already established its rule and order,<br>
          we are latecomers to the Symphony Orchestra.</p>
        <p>Instead, seek your superpowers in what you already own,<br>
          in the things that have already sprung.</p>
        <p>In the incredible adaptability of your body,<br>
          in your raw, unleashed consciousness.</p>
        <p>If you are good to your body, you body will flourish,<br>
          it is a biological system, not that different from a flower.</p>
        <p>If you are good to your mind, it will expand,<br>
          it is a navigational system with landmarks.</p>
        <p>Your mind is especially beautiful,<br>
          it has a large memory capacity.</p>
        <p>You can&apos;t recall letters on a particular page in a book,<br>
          but you can recall the walls in your home, the streets in your city.</p>
        <p>Your mind does not differentiate between navigating a road,<br>
          or a vast galaxy of star constellations.</p>
        <p>Your mind can encode interconnected knowledge,<br>
          so as long as it is marked with pictures and relative locations on a well connected tree.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>It is foolish to think to a particular page,<br>
          and feel ordinary for not being able to recall all the words.</p>
        <p>It is foolish to try to ride a boat,<br>
          on a road.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Do not seek to invent your superpowers,<br>
          instead, recognize the ones you already have - and expand them.</p>
