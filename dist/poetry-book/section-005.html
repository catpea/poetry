        <p>At the center of our being,<br>
          we each have a collection.</p>
        <p>It makes us unique,<br>
          but we never lose our connection.</p>
        <p>As with all things in life,<br>
          it is too easy to get lost in strife.</p>
        <p>We have to protect what makes us unique,<br>
          if you fail, your future will be bleak.</p>
        <p>With all things we do,<br>
          sometimes the bad guys slip through.</p>
        <p>This is what we need courage for,<br>
          to look them in the eyes, and slam the door.</p>
        <p>The unique collection at our center, is our power.<br>
          It transforms, and evolves, hour after hour.</p>
        <p>We start with just the Ocean, Skies, Mountains, Stars, Earth and Mars,<br>
          maybe Flowers, Gardens, Kittens, Dogs, Horses and Frogs.</p>
        <p>But then it grows, call it soul, or spirit, personality or vitality,<br>
          it becomes... Beauty, Endurance, Authenticity, Nobility, Love and Dignity.</p>
        <p>And it keeps growing, so as long as you Love Yourself,</p>
        <p>It creates Leaders, Protectors, Guides, Teachers, Dreamers,<br>
          Adventurers, Explorers and Discoverers,<br>
          Intellectuals, Humanitarians, Philosophers,<br>
          Scientists, Astronomers,<br>
          Dancers, Athletes, Bodybuilders,<br>
          Chefs, Blacksmiths, and Makers,<br>
          Musicians, Poets, Sculptors, Photographers and Filmmakers,<br>
          Artists and Designers,<br>
          Hackers and Programmers,<br>
          Genius...<br>
          Visionaries...<br>
          Founders....</p>
        <p>You have to protect what makes you unique at all cost,<br>
          if you start letting go, you will become lost.</p>
        <p>And many will come, and many with care and kindness,<br>
          and they will try to change you, in their blindness.</p>
        <p>You cannot grow up, if you start letting go,<br>
          you need an unbroken chain, you need that flow.</p>
        <p>You have to learn to say,<br>
          that it&apos;s either you, the one one who stands and is true,<br>
          or you are through.</p>
        <p>To grow up, into who you need to be,<br>
          is your right, and your dignity.</p>
        <p>To let bullies push you around,<br>
          is to fail, and falter,<br>
          and run aground.</p>
        <p>Decades, decades after they are long gone, do not let go,<br>
          do not take their turns, do not change your view,<br>
          you must aim to become worthy of you.</p>
        <p>Whether you believe in Heroes,<br>
          on that we are only Human.</p>
        <p>It is the same height,<br>
          just a maximum of our might.</p>
        <p>Push, and stand up, and aim up, and rise,<br>
          Open your eyes,<br>
          it is the only way to become wise.</p>
        <p>Fight for who you are,<br>
          because in time,<br>
          that fight is also for who you need to be.</p>
        <p>For who you need to be,<br>
          to be strong and healthy,<br>
          and unbreakable and worthy.</p>

        <p>As I woke up this morn,<br>
          I knew my recreational programming schedule will be torn.</p>
        <p>I put on my slippers, and I shuffled down stairs,<br>
          and begun slowly sorting through all my kitchen wares.</p>
        <p>For today, is my Spring Cleaning day,<br>
          and I will have little time to play.</p>
        <p>I wished and washed, and sloshed and swished,<br>
          in the end all my cleaning sponges looked squished.</p>
        <p>To complete my mission, I had to update my fire alarms,<br>
          so I grabbed my ladder, and put tools under my arms.</p>
        <p>My bendy scissors, and my rusty screwdriver<br>
          that looks like I stole it from a scuba diver.</p>
        <p>And climbed, my three little steps,<br>
          all the while flexing my triceps.</p>
        <p>When I finally made it to the top,<br>
          the little screw wouldn&apos;t fit, so I got down and poked it with my mop.</p>
        <p>I said, &quot;This a job for &apos;mah power-tools,<br>
          I need my drill, this ain&apos;t no job for fools.&quot;</p>
        <p>I cannot describe to You with what amazing grace,<br>
          I made that hole, and fireproofed my place.</p>
        <p>As I was making my way down,<br>
          I almost felt like I earned a crown.</p>
        <p>But, when I reached the bottom, I found a screw,<br>
          I must have dropped it... it was brand new.</p>
        <p>But! In the end I made it all work,<br>
          and muttered, &quot;Guess, I am not such a dork.&quot;</p>
        <p>Now, when I look up and tilt my head,<br>
          I can see it... slowly blinking red.</p>

        <p>Did you know, that we can&apos;t grow,<br>
          unless our lessons connect together?<br>
          We learn the way we navigate cities.</p>
        <p>If we leap from one city center, to another...<br>
          we will not know, where to go, or what to do.<br>
          None of the roads will make any sense.</p>
        <p>To divide knowledge into subjects,<br>
          and encourage cramming, and memorization,<br>
          and force remembering over understanding.</p>
        <p>That is not Education, or Knowledge.<br>
          We can no more leap between subjects,<br>
          than hobbies, or families.</p>
        <p>What connects two things together,<br>
          is as important as the things themselves.</p>
        <p>We only learn when two connect,<br>
          and, then the two connect to a third one,<br>
          and next one, to no end.</p>
        <p>We need a pleasant memorable,<br>

        <p>Disconnected snippets,<br>

        <p>Think of a trickster, a real bad fool.</p>
        <p>What a great robbery it would be.<br>
          If your parents sent you to college.<br>
          And teachers sold disconnected snippets.<br>
          And called it knowledge.</p>
        <p>And wouldn&apos;t it be convenient,<br>
          if you could chose you next batch.<br>
          Wouldn&apos;t the trickster rejoice,<br>
          had you called, that, a choice.</p>
        <p>And then at the end of the day.<br>
          When hard earned money was taken.<br>
          You wouldn&apos;t even be shaking,<br>
          even though it was worse than a break-in.</p>
        <p>Think of a trickster, a real bad fool,<br>
          that took away your very own school.</p>
        <p>The moral of this story,<br>
          is that you should think through,<br>
          when someone offers to teach you.</p>
        <p>Education, requires that you learn on your own,<br>
          that something that teaching can only postpone.</p>

        <p>We are born to run our fingers through infinity,<br>

        <p>It is our right to touch the greatest of heights,<br>
          and it is our privilege to cheer for each other in triumph.</p>
        <p>We have no flaws, no ugliness, no weakness, and no limit,<br>
          be it Tenzing and Hillary, or Viktor Emil Frankl.</p>
        <p>Nothing can stop us,<br>
          there are no bars thick enough,<br>
          there are no bars strong enough,</p>
        <p>&quot;We are the Captains of our Souls,<br>
          And The Masters of Out Fate&quot;</p>
        <p>However, there is a culture that we must never let go of,</p>
        <p>The culture of, Love of Wisdom,<br>
          The culture of, Inheritance of Knowledge.</p>
        <p>If we are tricked to reject Wisdom,<br>
          and if there is no teacher or parent,<br>
          or friend left to remind us,<br>
          then all will be lost.</p>
        <p>Your work will not set you free,<br>
          it is a lie as old as slavery.</p>
        <p>Your teachers can only remind,<br>
          but they cannot reach into your mind.</p>
        <p>Fight for your right to knowledge,<br>
          there is no university,<br>
          there is no college,<br>
          you have to use your heart to learn,<br>
          only you can do that.</p>
        <p>Without Inheritance of Wisdom,<br>
          you will become cursed to start at zero.</p>
        <p>As magnificent as your battle will be,<br>
          you will only reach a path, that was walked countless times before.</p>
        <p>You must start,<br>
          where the greatest minds <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Science_communicators">left off</a>.</p>
