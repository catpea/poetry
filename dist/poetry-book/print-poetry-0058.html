        <p>While not everything can be planned,<br>
          authenticity and learning go hand in hand.</p>
        <p>Some lessons can get pretty tough,<br>
          but will fix us, sure enough.</p>
        <p>When life gets sad or feels no good,<br>
          it may be something you misunderstood.</p>
        <p>And our views will shift,<br>
          and we&apos;ll convert that bad into a gift.</p>
        <p>Pretenders, can&apos;t learn this way,<br>
          always in the dark, be it night or day.</p>
        <p>They walk an alien path,<br>
          darkness and wrath.</p>
        <p>There is nothing there to fix,<br>
          it&apos;s all an incomprehensible mix.</p>
        <p>To live on a spectrum opposite of devious,<br>
          makes each day connect with the previous,</p>
        <p>And as days add up, they make you stronger,<br>
          and your steps travel even longer.</p>
        <p>Each day turns into gifts and rewards,<br>
          you stop being played, and create your own chords.</p>
        <p>Authenticity is a superpower,<br>
          it will help you rise, and you&apos;ll never cower.</p>
        <p>Day after day you become more powerful,<br>
          this is how we become truly beautiful.</p>
        <p>It will help you finish what you start,<br>
          and your life, will become, a work of art.</p>
