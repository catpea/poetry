        <p>Well, from the first moment on,<br>
          we are asked if we should live in harmony.</p>
        <p>We are still very young,<br>
          barely know of the world.</p>
        <p>And already the question of harmony comes,<br>
          and in harmony we learn, and thrive.</p>
        <p>Away from it, we&apos;ll be interrupted,<br>
          and feel lost in the void.</p>
        <p>It is a simple choice,<br>
          but out minds are not ready to make it.</p>
        <p>Often we forget.</p>
        <p>We forget about our little gardens,<br>
          and all the little walks.</p>
        <p>We forget how amazing it felt,<br>
          to stand on the wing of a plane.</p>
        <p>We forget the taste of popcorn at the Zoo,<br>
          or even how enormous Zoo felt.</p>
        <p>We forget pebbles at the river,<br>
          and mischievous squires at the park.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>That little dog with a bark,<br>
          that scaredy kitten always hiding in the dark.</p>
        <p>Our collection of unused keys,<br>
          and the box of bottle caps we collected with ease.</p>
        <p>We forgot our Lego and the old bike,<br>
          with that seat that we used to really like.</p>
        <p>We don&apos;t remember the Palaces and Castles,<br>
          that we used to love, and those swords, that fit us like a glove.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Everybody else came around,<br>
          acting like they know the ground.</p>
        <p>But, this was our gift from the Universe,<br>
          an affinity for flowering gardens, and little passage ways, and all those flying planes.</p>
        <p>It was a key to unlock our mind,<br>
          to understand the zoo, and our size in the universe, connect with pebbles at the beach.</p>
        <p>It is a pathway that fits us best,<br>
          to love little creatures, and collect some shineys, and build with blocks, and ride far and wide.</p>
        <p>It was to remind us,<br>
          to find our place among Great Beings, and study and pursue excellence, in all we do.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Then they sent us to First Grade,<br>
          and the weird kid peed into the Duplo, they didn&apos;t even have Lego.</p>
        <p>Then the teacher graded you down for counting pebles in your pocket,<br>
          and did it so many times, you lost track.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>There was a whisper about the pebbles,<br>
          it was Mr. Sagan - &quot;You are made of Star Stuff.&quot;</p>
        <p>And then the kids whispered...<br>
          to push you in the mud.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Push their laughter aside,<br>
          you&apos;ll need to Learn, and learn really hard.</p>
        <p>Cause right now, you&apos;re in the mud,<br>
          and you need to hang on.</p>
        <p>It will get worse,<br>
          but all you have to do is rise.</p>
        <p>Each time,<br>
          you&apos;ll rise higher.</p>
        <p>(When in trouble, call the Police it is OK for kids to call the Police, they&apos;ll love helping you, don&apos;t be scared.)</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Third Grade,<br>
          Fifth Grade.</p>
        <p>Low grade,<br>
          Uhh, but there can&apos;t be higher.</p>
        <p>Because by this time, you&apos;re getting bad grades,<br>
          because the teacher thinks you&apos;re copying from somewhere.</p>
        <p>The bullies know,<br>
          you did it on your own.</p>
        <p>Saw you pacing for days,<br>
          with your first program.</p>
        <p>Keep going forward,<br>
          don&apos;t let go - you&apos;re doing great, stay away from the hate.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>By the time you&apos;re out of Eight Grade,<br>
          by rejecting crazy, and nonsense, and stupid, and lazy, you graduate above all others.</p>
        <p>Because you didn&apos;t follow,<br>
          because you chose to study on your own, at your own pace.</p>
        <p>Because worthless grades meant nothing,<br>
          you felt no stress.</p>
        <p>Because, you didn&apos;t follow<br>
          nothing could hurt you.</p>
        <p>And your world is yours,<br>
          truly-truly yours.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>We unravel, when we forget who we are,<br>
          the moment we hide, or pretend, or follow.</p>
        <p>And, gosh darn it,<br>
          it happens when we are still kids.</p>
        <p>We are completely unprepared,<br>
          and none will help.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>So you! have to keep it together,<br>
          you can&apos;t let anyone hurt your mind.</p>
        <p>In High School, the pretenders make a sudden appearance,<br>
          never held a book in their hand.</p>
        <p>The back of Hamlet,<br>
          all the quotes have more IQ.</p>
        <p>Let the little Caesars,<br>
          keep the wind from the hall away.</p>
        <p>You need to pace your reading at the library,<br>
          teach yourself focus.</p>
        <p>Don&apos;t EVER! finish the books,<br>
          just get to the part that is valuable to you, and skip the rest.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Start working on your start-up early,<br>
          it is a study in failure.</p>
        <p>You need to create a series of CONTROLLED FAILURES,<br>
          this is very important.</p>
        <p>Learn <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=content+management">content management</a>,<br>
          and figure out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=stripe+wordpress">billing</a></p>
        <p>That&apos;s your surface platform,<br>
          and think about nature of business.</p>
        <p>Never try to build things directly,<br>
          facilitate the building of direct things for others.</p>
        <p>Help them setup,<br>
          so that you are not burdened, and keep going.</p>
        <p>Look at the structure of start-up accelerators, or even banks,<br>
          they take a percent, and never create what will weigh them down.</p>
        <p>Eventually, you can build your own Tesla,<br>
          but at first, you start with services.</p>
        <p>Look at the gym,<br>
          monthly subscription, is most stable.</p>
        <p>The lessons, are all around you.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>You don&apos;t need college,<br>
          but taking college classes is very relaxing.</p>
        <p>Make sure you get a 4.0 at each class,<br>
          be ready to repeat it.</p>
        <p>And enjoy,<br>
          the lectures.</p>
        <p>College is just a toy,<br>
          it looks bad on your Portfolio, so hide it.</p>
        <p>It is a very weak teaching experience,<br>
          and people know that there there is minimal learning involved.</p>
        <p>Jumping from high school to start-ups is more impressive,<br>
          and shows that you chose knowledge over nonsense.</p>
        <p>It shows that you chose to learn on your own,<br>
          to take care of your own mind,<br>
          rather than to pretend to learn for grades.</p>
        <p>Authenticity is very important in life,<br>
          it is hard to connect with people that role play.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Bonding with people that are just acting,<br>
          is only functional for as long as they are acting.</p>
        <p>But it is never good,<br>
          eventually they&apos;ll have a crisis, similar to a mid-life crisis.</p>
        <p>Stay Authentic,<br>
          keep to to those who are Authentic.</p>
        <p>Be safe.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>When it feels like everyone else is having an amazing life,<br>
          and you are stuck.</p>
        <p>Umm... that not true</p>
        <p>But it is also not healthy to think this way about yourself,<br>
          you are not beneath the party goers, they don&apos;t have what you have in your mind.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>But, that&apos;s far enough,<br>
          time to get some rest.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>This is where it gets interesting,<br>
          you have primed your mind for Business.</p>
        <p>That is a fine first step,<br>
          now you need to get ready for the real graduation.</p>
        <p>You need to section hike the equivalent of the Appalachian Trail,<br>
          and measure your jogging a hundred miles at a time.</p>
        <p>Section jogging, the Western States 100.</p>
        <p>Mind and Body, for the rest of your life.</p>
        <p>You must take good care of both.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>At mile fifty, halfway through a run,<br>
          as you piece together your blurry thoughts of your next business.</p>
        <p>Take some time to understand what it is that College Grads have,<br>
          those are very brittle relationships, and inflexible careers.</p>
        <p>We all feel the promise, but we can&apos;t fake it,<br>
          it would be the opposite, and certainly not worthy of you, my Friends.</p>
        <p>You can only find your meaning in Authenticity,<br>
          shortcuts will only take you back to the beginning.</p>
        <p>To live among the Extraordinary,<br>
          you must become Extraordinary yourself.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>The gateway to Meaning of Life,<br>
          is in that tiny moment when you think to your self:</p>
        <p>&quot;I am not going to jog tonight, I need rest.&quot;</p>
        <p>Right there in that dot,<br>
          is the keyhole,<br>
          to the key that you are,<br>
          to the gateway that you need to open.</p>
        <p>Life is not a simulation,<br>
          there are no days off,<br>
          life is quite a challenge,<br>
          and demands that each moment builds on the authenticity of the previous.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Open the dot, how can you yearn for Authenticity and Companionship,<br>
          and cancel, and fall short, and not enough, and rest some more.</p>
        <p>The gateway between Ordinary and Extraordinary,<br>
          is in accepting that we haven&apos;t got a choice to make.</p>
        <p>But shoes... to put on,<br>
          your Mind and Body must grow in harmony.</p>
        <p>You must not let go of the Harmony,<br>
          of your Magnificent Existence.</p>
        <p>Each small success, by subtle analogy,<br>
          pushes you forward, to your next step.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Eventually your tightly controlled business failures,<br>
          will fail, they will, fail to fail.</p>
        <p>Your mind too,<br>
          it won&apos;t perceive the easy choice as an option.</p>
        <p>All- will proceed,<br>
          in harmony.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Labored breathing,<br>
          by the Pine Trees at Western States,</p>
        <p>Another great step in Automation of your business,<br>
          and more investors.</p>
        <p>And you&apos;re no longer stopping at the first thing you find in books,<br>
          you understand all of it.</p>
        <p>What is made by humans,<br>
          is also All Too Human.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>And the Bullies are Gone,<br>
          and Eight Grade still sucks.</p>
        <p>High school ... influences,<br>
          are trying to figure out where they went wrong - good luck!</p>
        <p>College, is still a very romantic idea,<br>
          but it is best left to imagination.</p>
        <p>Your dreams are so much more now,<br>
          only what you create can live up to them.</p>
        <p>You are a Leader,<br>
          full of might an joy.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>And now you know,<br>
          shortcuts only lead people to their beginnings.</p>
        <p>And the one road, the only road,<br>
          was the one of Authenticity, and Achievement.</p>
        <p>Where we learned for real, not for grades,<br>
          where what we learned added up to create wisdom, and not a stupid GPA.</p>
        <p>You&apos;ll be OK, so as long as you Learn onward and become Wise,<br>
          and Live in Authentic Harmony with Yourself.</p>
        <p>This is how you become an Adult,<br>
          that was the one thing that all others were missing.</p>
        <p>It&apos;s what made them pretend and simulate,<br>
          but, growing up can&apos;t be faked.</p>
        <p>Growing up has to be written by the choices you make,<br>
          on the surface, that is your lifetime.</p>
        <p>The dreams you always dream, will come true,<br>
          but not in your childhood, childhood is for learning.</p>
        <p>Live in Harmony with yourself,<br>
          and live in harmony with the Universe.</p>
        <p>Growing up is really special,<br>
          it is really important for our health.</p>
        <p>It is a deeply internal process,<br>
          and there are no shortcuts to growing up.</p>
        <p>It is meant to be,<br>
          Beautiful.</p>
