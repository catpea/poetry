        <p>While not everything can be planned,<br>
          authenticity and learning go hand in hand.</p>
        <p>Some lessons can get pretty tough,<br>
          but will fix us, sure enough.</p>
        <p>When life gets sad or feels no good,<br>
          it may be something you misunderstood.</p>
        <p>And our views will shift,<br>
          and we&apos;ll convert that bad into a gift.</p>
        <p>Pretenders, can&apos;t learn this way,<br>
          always in the dark, be it night or day.</p>
        <p>They walk an alien path,<br>
          darkness and wrath.</p>
        <p>There is nothing there to fix,<br>
          it&apos;s all an incomprehensible mix.</p>
        <p>To live on a spectrum opposite of devious,<br>
          makes each day connect with the previous,</p>
        <p>And as days add up, they make you stronger,<br>
          and your steps travel even longer.</p>
        <p>Each day turns into gifts and rewards,<br>
          you stop being played, and create your own chords.</p>
        <p>Authenticity is a superpower,<br>
          it will help you rise, and you&apos;ll never cower.</p>
        <p>Day after day you become more powerful,<br>
          this is how we become truly beautiful.</p>
        <p>It will help you finish what you start,<br>
          and your life, will become, a work of art.</p>

        <p>Every way of thinking about the world,<br>
          brings us closer together, despite, what we are told.</p>
        <p>There is just one little thing to keep in mind,<br>
          we have to leave all the bad ideas, behind.</p>
        <p>Exchange of ideas came a long way,<br>
          but we still need to eliminate foul play.</p>
        <p>Because not everyone is educated,<br>
          and without wisdom life gets complicated.</p>
        <p>Misinformed people are easily swayed,<br>
          they are often unprepared, and very scared.</p>
        <p>If we build to remove their fears,<br>
          they will love us... to tears.</p>
        <p>The most powerful early-tool is the Audiobook,<br>
          wisdom delivered in a way that&apos;s hard to overlook.</p>
        <p>It is private, and comes with no shame,<br>
          it can take a person from poverty to Hall of Fame.</p>
        <p>And the best type of things to listen to,<br>
          are memoirs or lectures, that enlarge a world view.</p>
        <p>We must stop bad education from tearing us apart,<br>
          we each have to learn, and become smart.</p>
        <p>This day of Wisdom, and Peace that we yearn,<br>
          comes closer each day that we learn.</p>

        <p>Bicycling some years ago, out thirty miles away,<br>
          along a road, and an ancient highway.</p>
        <p>I found an overpass where I could perch upon,<br>
          and I discovered I wasn&apos;t really alone.</p>
        <p>I figured it was the a huge love story,<br>
          about a boy named Harold and a girl named Wally.</p>
        <p>She was a Book Worm, a Hero, and a Graffiti Artist,<br>
          and Harold loved her because she was the Smartest!</p>
        <p>Wally fell in love with Harold,<br>
          as she knew he was a Poet with a Heart of Gold.</p>
        <p>In 1980 some 40 years ago,<br>
          the two adventurers gave it ago.</p>
        <p>They set off for Center State,<br>
          and that became their Longest Date!</p>
        <p>It all their walking, it never rained,<br>
          and it never too sunny, neither complained.</p>
        <p>They waked holding hands together for a hundred miles,<br>
          their adventure was amazing, nothing but smiles.</p>
        <p>When they finally arrived at Mount Pleasant,<br>
          Harold quietly gave Wally her present.</p>
        <p>It was a little book of foolish rhyme,<br>
          that Harold wrote over a long stretch of time.</p>
        <p>They both just happily turned 57,<br>
          their life together is pure Heaven.</p>
        <p>Both are super smart, extremely young, and very strong,<br>
          their sweet love for each other, is lifelong.</p>
        <p>They still do their Mount Pleasant walk,<br>
          holding hands for days, sleeping-in until nine o&apos;clock.</p>
        <p>Harold makes really, really good Vegan Lettuce Wraps,<br>
          and Wally is a master at reading Maps.</p>
        <p>They&apos;ve been to all kinds of interesting places,<br>
          and they always arrive with beaming and smiling faces.</p>

        <p>There is a very special group of people, that many have forgotten,<br>
          our Intellectual Foremothers and Forefathers.</p>
        <p>They brings us gifts wrapped in the primitive art of writing text, on paper.<br>
          It is frequently all they had, it was the only way to reach us.</p>
        <p>They are brilliant, and healthy, and unbroken, and triumphant,<br>
          they are full of light, more than history will ever tell us.</p>
        <p>Nobody who outlives an empire, will have their history shown for the lovely thing it was.<br>
          This served to protect them, and it failed to erase them.</p>
        <p>We must never allow ourselves to merely listen to history,<br>
          because those are always writ by prevalent powers, it was their job to erase them.</p>
        <p>More modern Philosophers had the same problem,<br>
          Our friend, Dear Friedrich, and what a Warrior...</p>
        <p>Was smeared by the Nazis, he was so powerful, that everyone wanted a piece of his might.<br>
          Friedrich Nietzsche hated what Nazis stood for.</p>
        <p>Recently, one of the Great Modern Philosophers was under attack, it deeply hurt and frightened her,<br>
          but her classrooms rose for her with noting but love and continued admiration.</p>
        <p>We are tasked with bringing the light of our hearts, and resurrecting those who passed,<br>
          not by merely understanding their books, but by understanding what they were trying to say.</p>
        <p>And it is OK, to understand them in our own way at first,<br>
          it takes time, to befriend someone, from a book, across time.</p>
        <p>Yes, all we have to go on, is text on paper.<br>
          But we know they were just like us, they were All Too Human, friendly, and of good cheer.</p>
        <p>If they made mistakes, these Great Beings were not stained for long,<br>
          they rose, and they took their miserable failures, to create gifts of prevention for us.</p>
        <p>These gifts are complex, they are as complex and nuanced as You and I.<br>
          It takes hard work to inherit gifts this powerful.</p>
        <p>The only way to unwrap those Gifts of Wisdom is with Admiration, Friendship and Love,<br>
          schools teach us to see Great Beings as these synthetic monoliths of concrete.</p>
        <p>But nothing could be further from the truth, because all these Great Beings,<br>
          they were once kids, and teenagers, they had heartaches, dreams and hopes.</p>
        <p>They were just like you and I, but they invented ideas that they cared to share,<br>
          and they rose to the challenges of leadership to preserve them.</p>
        <p>Those ideas are our intellectual inheritance,<br>
          here is my attempt to name a few for your pleasure.</p>

        <p>If you want change, you can&apos;t continue doing the same things you&apos;ve always done.<br>
          If you really want change, then you are going to have to alter your course, now.</p>
        <p>If you don&apos;t fight back, you will always lose,<br>
          and if you stay in the dark, you will only add to the darkness.</p>
        <p>There cannot be a compromise between good and evil,<br>
          a compromise only takes from the good, and only give s to the evil.</p>
        <p>Your office window, is not a substitute for a Call to the Wild,<br>
          Your next promotion does not actually make you a greater person.</p>
        <p>A vacation, cannot set you free, it is not a substitute for nature.<br>
          Dressing beautifully, has never made a person truly beautiful.</p>
        <p>Waiting for that perfect someone, will not help them notice you.<br>
          Trusting that someone else will help you, is just another delay.</p>
        <p>And just getting out there, is not enough to be understood.<br>
          And going out, following friends, can only put you on somebody else&apos;s path.</p>
        <p>Life is not hard, it only gets complicated when you follow,<br>
          because by following you just end up in places you don&apos;t understand.</p>
        <p>You must lead. And you must keep walking forward. Your own step, after your own step.<br>
          In your own direction, towards the things that move you, only then can You be Trully Moved.</p>
        <p>It must the correct combination of books, poems, steps, events, summers, and epochs.<br>
          Do not try to hurry, do not change roads, only move up, only think, and envision, and grow.</p>
        <p>That which leads to Your Greatness, to Your Freedom, to Your Nature, requires, Truth.<br>
          Walk your own path at your own pace. Only the correct key, can set your mind free.</p>
        <p>The others who seem to have it all right.<br>
          Often get lost on alien paths, and merely put on a happy face.</p>
        <p>While it seems like you are trapped today, you are not, it is just an illusion.<br>
          Look towards the car keys.</p>
        <p>That is all it will take. Grab the keys and go.<br>
          It will be very difficult at first.</p>
        <p>The toxic build up that is keeping you from getting up, right now,<br>
          takes three days to crumble. It is a heavy cage.</p>
        <p>But there is a way.<br>
          A simple way.</p>
        <p>Grab the keys, and go... i275 south, merge onto 75 south,<br>
          and take it all the way down... Florida Keys, US Highway One.</p>
        <p>If you live in Florida, then you are headed for Michigan&apos;s Upper Peninsula.<br>
          If you live West, your destination is all the way East.</p>
        <p>It is not the destination, it is the Journey, my Friend.<br>
          Take your time, watch the cage crumble and fade as you go.</p>
        <p>Only the important things, will stay.<br>
          And you&apos;ll get to see yourself again.</p>
        <p>And you&apos;ll get to be free again,<br>
          you will resume where you left of.</p>
        <p>A life of bondage,<br>
          is not worthy of you.</p>
        <p>Life is not meant to be a cage, or cruel, or frighten you.<br>
          You knew this as a child, and you let that slip away, not even noticing when it went.</p>
        <p>It is your Right to resist being pushed into places that you don&apos;t want to be in.<br>
          It is your Right to reject conditions that you never agreed to, that you were pushed into.</p>
        <p>How else can the Universe be worthy of us, how else can our lives be beautiful.<br>
          Heaven and Paradise are real, but they are now, right now. Now.</p>
        <p>How can people love you, when your own love for yourself is slipping away.<br>
          You have to. You have to accept the responsibility for your Health, and Dignity.</p>
        <p>You don&apos;t have to make it all the way, the first time,<br>
          and you don&apos;t have to leave your phone behind.</p>
        <p>You can call this therapy, or a vision quest, you can call it a road trip.<br>
          You are not allowed to live in a cage, of whatever constitution, that will make you ill.</p>
        <p>It comes to you naturally to take care of your body,<br>
          but your mind also requires care.</p>
        <p>When you reach your Freedom, you&apos;ll know what to do next,<br>
          it can be another trip, East, or West.</p>
        <p>If you feel trapped, the Universe is darker for it.<br>
          Take a week. Or two. Forty days is best. call it your Quarantine.</p>
        <p>Unless you clear you mind, and focus on what is important,<br>
          on you and those worthy of your care, you will lose it.</p>
        <p>You will forget the beautiful person you truly are,<br>
          you will fall from heaven, and forget about paradise.</p>
        <p>And life will turn into a black and white TV show.<br>
          You must take good care of your mind.</p>
        <p>If there is no one else that cares about you,<br>
          then look at this poem.</p>
        <p>I care.<br>
          Hi!</p>
        <p>I am, speaking for you!<br>
          grab the keys, or bicycle, or comfy shoes, and go.</p>
        <p>Go, and never again, let go.</p>
        <p>Your health is important.<br>
          Your well being is important.</p>
        <p>A Human Being is Meant to Learn,<br>
          A Human Being is Meant to Rise.</p>
        <p>You are meant to filled with Wisdom,<br>
          with Joy and Love of Life.</p>
        <p>You are meant to Laugh,<br>
          Truly Fully Laugh.</p>
        <p>Listen to me, there is more.<br>
          You Are Meant To Become A Great Being.</p>

        <p>from <a href="https://westland-valhalla.github.io/warrior/">The Warrior Book</a></p>
        <p>A Warrior is She that thrives and triumphs where&#x2019;er She be.<br>
          You cannot be broken, you must use your misfortune to light your way.</p>
        <p>You can learn anything you want, there are no smarter.<br>
          They are just actors, with a handful of fragile lessons, crafted to impress.</p>
        <p>There is nothing that can break you, there are no stronger.<br>
          Look to the source of the pain, it comes from Innocence.</p>
        <p>Nothing rooted in Innocence is ugly, all lessons that come from being tricked,<br>
          add up to make you more beautiful, enable your insight and foresight, and fuel your authenticity.</p>
        <p>When the regrets come at night, that&apos;s just you brain asking you,<br>
          to think harder, to comprehend your beauty in full,</p>
        <p>No one can trick you, not for long enough. So, don&apos;t be scared.<br>
          Memoirs, Audio-books, Lectures will show you how many better people there are.</p>
        <p>We all have to Enlarge our Worlds daily.<br>
          Audiobooks, and Lectures, will show you that all you have met thus far were just the same type of person.</p>
        <p>Do not be afraid to rise.</p>
        <p>The people, or person you have long though about, exist.<br>
          But before they can see you, you have to rise, and shine, and be seen.</p>
        <p>Don&apos;t be scared.</p>
        <p>Those who will use your Love, Innocence, Endurance and Generosity against you,<br>
          have long been lost, they are blinded, and fractured, and damaged, and broken.</p>
        <p>They hold no power over you.</p>
        <p>If their attacks continue they will grind themselves to dust,<br>
          and all the experiences that will be left in their wake, will make you stronger and better.</p>
        <p>Battles make you stronger, smarter, more beautiful.<br>
          You are a Warrior, that&apos;s the oldest name for it.</p>
        <p>A Warrior is She that uses the harm that came her way as energy,<br>
          who understands none can stay a child and all must grow, and enlarge their worlds.</p>
        <p>A Warrior can never be damaged, or hurt -- a Warrior Learns.<br>
          A Warrior resists tears in the rain, just like she can resist weakness.</p>
        <p>We live in a fragile world, full of fragile people, with fragile egos,<br>
          they speak fragile advice, with fragile words; from their fragile hills.</p>
        <p>A Warrior does not wait to be taught.<br>
          A Warrior learns fastest on her own.</p>
        <p>Learn in the sequence that fits you best,<br>
          learn at the pace that helps you most.</p>
        <p>Push the dark imaginings back,<br>
          and rise.</p>
        <p>Move your hand.<br>
          And push up.<br>
          And stand up.</p>
        <p>Get ready to walk,<br>
          and then run, day, after day, slightly longer.</p>
        <p>And then lift your weights, the way you learned to run,<br>
          and then lift for longer, and never rest.</p>
        <p>And then, with your sweetest audio-book.</p>
        <p>Step.<br>
          Step Up.<br>
          Rise Up.<br>
          To No End.</p>
        <p>This is The Life Of A Warrior.</p>
        <p>Nothing Can Crush You,<br>
          Nothing Can Hold You.</p>
        <p>Don&apos;t You See?</p>
        <p>Everything Makes You Stronger,<br>
          Everything Makes You Fight Longer.</p>
        <p>You,<br>
          Are A Warrior.</p>

        <p>Somehow, Wednesday turned out to be the tiniest day.<br>
          I was quiet all day, slowly programming away.</p>
        <p>I&apos;ve been thinking about my bicycle, birds, and rain,<br>
          but mostly working on my new website domain.</p>
        <p>My bicycle trails have been calling me all week,<br>
          I prepared my bicycle and am I ready, so to speak.</p>
        <p>There was much rain today,<br>
          it will take a few more days, before I pedal away.</p>
        <p>It is not always about the adventure,<br>
          I love how all the spring trees smell.</p>
        <p>How the birds sing in the morning,<br>
          how the air is crisp and new.</p>
        <p>I never set a plan as to how far I will ride,<br>
          I just get on the bicycle and enjoy the outside.</p>
        <p>Every once in a while I perch upon an overpass,<br>
          scribble code, or just watch the cars sometimes.</p>
        <p>There are many memorable places along the way,<br>
          they are all very tiny and hidden away.</p>
        <p>Old graffiti, sculptures and parks, abandoned railway,<br>
          I could talk about them all day.</p>
