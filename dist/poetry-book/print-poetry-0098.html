        <p>Take all that you are,<br>
          and forge a suit of armor.</p>
        <p>Paint, or sculpt, or cosplay,<br>
          we are always all to human, but we are unique.</p>
        <p>All your armor decorations, and Your medals of honor,<br>
          will show you as you are.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Keep growing up, keep adding to your story,<br>
          may your armor reflect the sun.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>And let go of the Poker Face,<br>
          that&apos;s not really You.</p>
        <p>If you must, show everyone how Mighty you are,<br>
          how Great and beautiful your Heart Is.</p>
        <p>Keep growing up, book by book,<br>
          poem by poem, art by art, and triumph, and failure.</p>
        <p>Build a mountain of worn out running shoes,<br>
          and torn up bodybuilding gloves.</p>
        <p>Fill Coffee Shops and Galleries with you Art,<br>
          with your Sculptures, or Music.</p>
        <p>Let who you are protect you from misfortune,<br>
          be authentic, always lead your own way, and never follow.</p>
        <p>Show The Word,<br>
          Who You Are.</p>
