        <p>Today was my day of rest,<br>
          and then I went jogging to run another test.</p>
        <p>I got really tired after my run,<br>
          but I said &quot;Not until I write my poem, will I be done.&quot;</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Earlier I wrote a little programs to <a href="https://github.com/fantasyui-com/mockup">make art</a><br>
          overall it was a really good start.</p>
        <p>I woke up at six in the morning,<br>
          and jumped out of bed without a warning.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Now the hour nears eleven,<br>
          getting into my bed will feel like heaven.</p>
        <p>I am not sure how I feel about staying up late to write my rhyme,<br>
          but there is something sweet about writing just before bed time.</p>
