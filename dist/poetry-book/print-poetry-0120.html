        <p>Anything that can go wrong may go wrong,<br>
          and there is only one guarantee in life.</p>
        <p>It is a guarantee, precisely because it is within our complete control,<br>
          the guarantee is The Greatness Of Our Soul, or Spirit, or Being.</p>
        <p>It means you will keep getting up no matter how many times you fall,<br>
          it means you will continue moving forward without stopping.</p><br>
        <p>It means there is no pain, it means there is no weakness,<br>
          that it is a function and fact of life that we advance forward.</p>
        <p>And on the day of triumph,<br>
          it means that the prize is nothing less than Laughter and Joy of Life.</p>
        <p>The Greatness of Our Soul, our single guarantee in life,<br>
          may begin in discomfort, but it concludes with something <strong>far</strong> more.</p><br>
        <p>Marvels of the Human Spirit that we can&apos;t directly conjure up within ourselves,<br>
          marvels that can only come out of our Might and Authenticity.</p>
        <p>Humor and Foolishness, Cheerfulness and Bliss,<br>
          Sweetens and Giggles, Joy, Laughter, Wisdom and Delight.</p>
        <p>Greatness of Soul.</p>
