        <p>Captain&apos;s Log, Quarantine, Day Twenty Seven,</p>
        <p>Ohh, I waited to write until eleven.</p>
        <p>It seems late at night,</p>
        <p>but this is when my rhymes take flight.</p>
        <p>I admit, I am ready for bed,</p>
        <p>but I am just going to sit here, instead,</p>
        <p>and wait for my poem to go ahead.</p>
        <p>Nuh uhh, rhyming is not always easy,</p>
        <p>sometimes you just got to to wait, and take it easy.</p>
        <p>Wait for the prime rhyme,</p>
        <p>to top of your mind... climb.</p>
        <p>And then finally, when you get there,</p>
        <p>you sit, read, and stare,</p>
        <p>feeling like the poem, is a little bare.</p>
        <p>But what can you do? It&apos;s late at night,</p>
        <p>and you are not really feeling very bright.</p>
        <p>But you still have to write,</p>
        <p>so that&apos;s quite all right.</p>
        <p>This is how I begin my night,</p>
        <p>I write.</p>
