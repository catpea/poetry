        <p>If everyone seems scary,<br>
          that&apos;s only because scary is all you&apos;ve ever met.</p>
        <p>I&apos;ve met them too, I saw what they can do.<br>
          How sure of themselves, how forward and blind.</p>
        <p>But, if you spend your life in hiding,<br>
          they will win, and rob you of everything precious.</p>
        <p>So rise, begin taking care of yourself,<br>
          and begin your search.</p>
        <p>Not a search for mere friends,<br>
          but a search for The Extraordinary.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>It is simple.<br>
          My friends.</p>
        <p>The only way to find The Extraordinary,<br>
          is to become Extraordinary yourself.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>If you got hurt before,<br>
          then you have already come a long way.</p>
        <p>You now hold a gift of Wisdom,<br>
          a Foresight that can spare suffering.</p>
        <p>No one is to take Love of Life from you,<br>
          no one is to rob you of Joy and Laughter.</p>
