        <p>Of course,<br>
          let us ask what their regrets are...</p>
        <p>We are after all the future generation,<br>
          to those that came before us.</p>
        <p>Therefore we have insight,<br>
          and certainly have regrets.</p>
        <p>We regret;<br>
          wars, poverty, hate and stupidity.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>We want World Peace,<br>
          because a single Human Life is more Sacred than all the gods put together,<br>
          because borders are stupid and war is hell,<br>
          because ongoing weapons manufacturing is evil.</p>
        <p>We want the End of Poverty,<br>
          because money should only be used to help a person and not make them worse,<br>
          because no one should be denied mental, dental or medical care,<br>
          because not a single Human Being should ever go hungry or thirsty.</p>
        <p>We want the Age of Wisdom,<br>
          because people must learn how to think before being told what to think,<br>
          because the Modern Human being must first catch up with Knowledge in Beloved Books,<br>
          because we must put an end to making mistakes that can otherwise be avoided.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>The World will not grow if Human Beings are prevented from Meaningful Education.<br></p>
        <p>The World will not grow if People are too scared, or too hungry, or too tired to learn.<br></p>
        <p>The World will not grow, if You, and I, and Everybody Else fails to Honor the Future Generations.<br></p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>As many evil forces as there are,<br>
          they will give up the moment they see that their lies can&apos;t move crowds anymore.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Moving against reality,<br>
          commits the followers to the forgotten side of history.</p>
        <p>Standing up for Truth and Authenticity,<br>
          fills us with Light of Wisdom, and Love of Humanity.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>You never know,<br>
          the first day,<br>
          when you become ready,</p>
        <p>to reinforce, or add a new article,<br>
          to a document that will define Humanity for all Generations.</p>
        <p>We can&apos;t be sure if this document exist yet,<br>
          perhaps you will begin writing it,</p>
        <p>perhaps your article will be the opening article,<br>
          and yours, the first signature.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>There are to many borders, My Friends,<br>
          and too often money is being used for harm, where it was invented for good.</p>
        <p>Our World, with Our Love and Our Blessing,<br>
          must take another Deep and Long Breath,<br>
          and Exhale in Blooming Changes all around.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Practice, take out your journal, and scribble to no end,<br>
          many high and mighty laws printed over and over on paper will not hold up forever.</p>
        <p>Humanity never moved toward some Economic Paradise,<br>
          it has always moved towards Goodness and Love.</p>
        <p>It has moved slowly, slowed down by poverty of so many,<br>
          slowed down by borders,<br>
          and people not yet ready to learn how to think before they are told what to think.</p>
        <p>But it has moved with unlimited strength,<br>
          sanding down to dust all that stood in the path of Good Ideas, and Goodness, and Love.</p>
        <p>Do not accept wrongs, on paper, or law, or the red faces of those moving against the grain of reality,<br>
          do not assume that the wrongs that stand today, will not be erased tomorrow.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Proudly, nobly, respectfully, deep in thought,<br>
          take time off, and reach out to world&apos;s best selling non fiction.</p>
        <p>My Friends,<br>
          May you laugh, may you celebrate, may you admire,<br>
          and learn from; and forgive mistakes leaving them to the past.</p>
