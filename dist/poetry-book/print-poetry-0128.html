        <p>One late afternoon I hopped on my bicycle to ride the trail,<br>
          and returned with an interesting tale.</p>
        <p>For right where 275 and Michigan meet,<br>
          I found a <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/En5tWm4Z93mmwtZ28">little bicycle path that&apos;s really neat</a>.</p><br>
        <p>It is a huge park that branches out to two more little parks,<br>
          though they are behind peoples houses and pack a lot of dog barks.</p>
        <p>All combined together they make a sweet little quest,<br>
          but make sure to bring plenty of water and rest.</p><br>
        <p>The main path has little river bridges and lots of really neat sights,<br>
          but be really careful about ticks and mosquitoes bites.</p>
        <p>And that northern stretch under the power line, is a sight to see,<br>
          it is just a barren bumpy grassland without a single tree.</p><br>
        <p>If you keep going north on Haggerty you&apos;ll reach Ford,<br>
          and then you can bicycle back to 275 and get back on board.</p>
        <p>But I think the woodland trail is the best because there is a lot of shade,<br>
          I imagine that&apos;s why it was made.</p>
