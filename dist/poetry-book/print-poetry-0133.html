        <p>Hey! whew,<br>
          it&apos;s only eight,</p>
        <p>and here I was worried,<br>
          that I am going to be late.</p>
        <p>Today is Friday,<br>
          and on every Friday I must look,</p>
        <p>for new ideas,<br>
          to add to my fancy <a href="https://westland-valhalla.github.io/warrior/">Warrior Book</a></p>
        <p>It is a book,<br>
          made out of videos,</p>
        <p>and some ideas,<br>
          don&apos;t have enough of those.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Last week,<br>
          I searched for &quot;Ladies Fast Draw&quot;,</p>
        <p>but it only returned three videos,<br>
          last time I saw.</p>
        <p>I also tried Women Sharp Shooting,<br>
          and Compound Bow,</p>
        <p>but something didn&apos;t fit,<br>
          the chapter just didn&apos;t flow.</p>
        <p>I am searching for<br>
          inspirational things,</p>
        <p>ideas that bring friends together,<br>
          and give them wings.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>I wrote that book to show all;<br>
          that we all start slow,</p>
        <p>but we can all become mighty,<br>
          so as long as we give it a go.</p>
        <p>All too frequently we assume,<br>
          that we have to have talent.</p>
        <p>and all the steps we take,<br>
          must be naturally gallant.</p>
        <p>But the truth is,<br>
          that we must fail to get there,</p>
        <p>effortlessly succeeding at anything,<br>
          is as boring as rare.</p>
        <p>No need to hurry,<br>
          we can learn really slow,</p>
        <p>the most important thing,<br>
          is that we grow.</p>
