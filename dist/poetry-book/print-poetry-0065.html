        <p>Each day we must learn,<br>
          and what we&apos;ve forgotten re-lean.</p>
        <p>Our life depends on clarity,<br>
          our visions must be sharp.</p>
        <p>A lesson learned, begets a wisdom.<br>
          Two create a kingdom.</p>
        <p>Our might comes from knowledge,<br>
          and you can&apos;t find that in college.</p>
        <p>Life is too short to lean in slices,<br>
          leave them to their own devices.</p>
        <p>You are a powerful being,<br>
          you learn fastest on your own.</p>
        <p>As few teachers there are,<br>
          so there are but a handful of books.</p>
        <p>It will be hard work,<br>
          to fill all the notebooks.</p>
        <p>But your mind is unique, anyway,<br>
          there is no substitute for your own way.</p>
        <p>At first it will be gibberish,<br>
          at last, they will read it feverish.</p>
        <p>You must not be tired,<br>
          your mind cannot be stressed.</p>
        <p>You must resist what they desired,<br>
          tell them you can&apos;t be hired.</p>
        <p>You are not a dime a dozen,<br>
          there is no other like you.</p>
        <p>You have to tend to your mind,<br>
          all the forgotten lessons remind.</p>
        <p>There cannot be anyone like you,<br>
          learn to reach your own breakthrough.</p>
        <p>Set your self free from the silly sting,<br>
          you are not just a little thing.</p>
        <p>No retreat, no surrender.<br>
          You are a meant to become a Great Being.</p>
