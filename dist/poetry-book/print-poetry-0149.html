        <p>Life is always about learning and knowing,<br>
          all those winds of change freely blowing.</p>
        <p>But there is something you must always remember,<br>
          that you are a <strong>Raging Fire</strong> not a glowing ember.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>It is your <strong>right</strong> to <strong>strive</strong> and <strong>thrive</strong> and <strong>grow</strong>,<br>
          may you <strong>melt</strong> all the sleeping-and-cold snow.</p>
        <p>Let there fill new oceans, let the rivers flow,<br>
          and may the sun shine forever with your beautiful glow.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>We each should live our lives with a huge thunder,<br>
          because no matter the tests life is always a wonder.</p>
        <p>But the best things come from us beating life&apos;s test,<br>
          by rising up, becoming wise, and doing our best.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>No challenge is ever as easy as it looks,<br>
          it all requires reading plenty of books.</p>
        <p>I don&apos;t think anybody is ever truly blessed,<br>
          I think life may push us all to feel stressed.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>But we are each so special and so strong, and so sweet,<br>
          that we can all take on the challenge, and handle the heat.</p>
        <p>All the things we hold tight to the breast,<br>
          always come from some hard challenge or quest.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>It is <strong>all</strong> about learning and taking that harder route,<br>
          so that each day we grow-more in wisdom and less in doubt.</p>
        <p>So please, always strive to do your best,<br>
          so that the 90 year old you can get some good night&apos;s rest.</p>
