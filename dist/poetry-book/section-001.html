        <p>Captain&apos;s Log: Day Eighteen of Quarantine.</p>
        <p>Researching, learning, computers being mean.</p>
        <p>It must be Friday, the eve of Eighteen,</p>
        <p>I peeked outside and I think the trees are turning green.</p>
        <p>But the squirrels, again, they act so weird,</p>
        <p>smart little kitties worried that everyone disappeared.</p>
        <p>Speaking of weird, programming is such a fun game,</p>
        <p>I am convinced it is unhealthy, but I think that&apos;s a shame.</p>
        <p>My computer programs kept me company since I was nine,</p>
        <p>I was so little, and already learning the command line.</p>
        <p>Alas, the time doth fly,</p>
        <p>as we grow older we must take to the sky.</p>
        <p>We have to learn beyond what is at our fingertips,</p>
        <p>and set aims for all those leaderships.</p>
        <p>We should pamper our talents, can&apos;t leave them behind,</p>
        <p>as we grow older they&apos;ll play a very important role in our peace of mind.</p>
        <p>My readers, we are each charged with becoming Teachers,</p>
        <p>share our knowledge, become Reason&apos;s own preachers.</p>
        <p>The Future is only as bright as Her Humanity,</p>
        <p>we are Her dignity, Her keepers of sanity.</p>
        <p>So, search for <a href="http://catpea.com/warrior">video tutorials</a>,</p>
        <p>maybe open a book,</p>
        <p>and take a look.</p>

        <p>Captain&apos;s Log: Day Seventeen of Quarantine.</p>
        <p>Found two bugs in code, and got stuck in between.</p>
        <p>I was supposed to be working on a Sound Machine,</p>
        <p>but spent the noon formatting the code to keep it clean.</p>
        <p>I can&apos;t believe, there is a bug in my code,</p>
        <p>its probably in octicons, because I am using node.</p>
        <p>Worst of all, I can&apos;t see it fail until I publish,</p>
        <p>because sapper likes static as not to be sluggish.</p>
        <p>So here I am, finally dressed up like Superman,</p>
        <p>Debugging code, blind, like a veritable caveman.</p>
        <p>I did a bit of soul searching,</p>
        <p>then followed with some researching.</p>
        <p>Now, I am sitting here, contemplating if I need a cape,</p>
        <p>wondering if I should follow up with an Audiotape.</p>
        <p>I could finish up getting in shape,</p>
        <p>and completely change the workout landscape.</p>
        <p>I am serious about making a workout tape,</p>
        <p>I really want to get in shape.</p>
        <p>What if the workout required wearing a tail?</p>
        <p>Would it become like super holy grail?</p>
        <p>I would walk the street and people would pale,</p>
        <p>&quot;Sir! Why have you done this?</p>
        <p>You, are a Whale!!!&quot;</p>

        <p>Captain&apos;s Log: Day Sixteen of Quarantine.</p>
        <p>Keeping it serious like Wolverine.</p>
        <p>I have decided not to rhyme,</p>
        <p>I really haven&apos;t got the time.</p>
        <p>I must leave the thieving Squirrels behind,</p>
        <p>yes, really, I don&apos;t mind.</p>
        <p>Today, is a new day, I am completely serious,</p>
        <p>I am going to ignore everything hilarious.</p>
        <p>I am not even joking, I&apos;ll ignore those furriers,</p>
        <p>I won&apos;t even pay attention to their funny scurries.</p>
        <p>I will sit here quiet,</p>
        <p>tending to my amazing diet...</p>
        <p>A stray thought bubbles to my idle mind,</p>
        <p>Oh, no, I hope people won&apos;t go blind!</p>
        <p>I think I am going to YouTube my workout dance,</p>
        <p>Now, where the heck did I put my underpants?</p>

        <p>Captain&apos;s Log: Day Fifteen of Quarantine,</p>
        <p>Squirrels continue being mean.</p>
        <p>They just aren&apos;t very keen, on the idea,</p>
        <p>that their theft gave them diarrhea.</p>
        <p>I know not what to do,</p>
        <p>Darn Squirrels! that Trailmix was not for you!</p>
        <p>Maybe someday we&apos;ll move on,</p>
        <p>come a sunny day, carry on.</p>
        <p>But today, is not that day,</p>
        <p>it&apos;s just Tuesday.</p>
        <p>This is getting out of control,</p>
        <p>I don&apos;t want to be a poet anymore!</p>
        <p>I just wanted to feed the creatures I adore.</p>
        <p>Not write strange rhymes out the front door.</p>
        <p>I must stop rhyming,</p>
        <p>this is not the right timing.</p>
        <p>I feel like I&apos;ve lost control,</p>
        <p>spiraling down a Squirrel Hole.</p>
        <p>I swear I am not like this in real life... I can change!</p>

        <p>Captain&apos;s Log, Day Twelve of Quarantine. I ordered some trailmix from the internet, mailman dropped it off by the door and all the local Squirrels I&apos;ve been feeding came over, ripped the box open, and ate it. How rude, I probably shoudn&apos;t have been feeding them all this time.</p>
