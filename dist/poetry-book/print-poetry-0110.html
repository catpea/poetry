        <p>Humanity must not be scared of poverty,<br>
          poverty is just a symptom of immature, shortsighted politics.</p>
        <p>For politics to grow up and begin helping the world heal,<br>
          <strong>we</strong> must begin growing up, and inspire the children to growing up as well.</p>
        <p>Nothing will change, nothing can change,<br>
          unless we begin our lives by resuming where great beings left off.</p>
        <p>There is just one road for all to agree,<br>
          the road of Reality, Results, Knowledge, Wisdom, Excellence, and Good Ideas.</p>
        <p>We receive a very good impression of the meaning of Wisdom when we are children,<br>
          we think of Adults as all-knowing, as always correct, and perfect.</p>
        <p>This is our aim now, for in the absence of teachers we must become the teachers,<br>
          we must become the adults we wished we grew up with.</p>
        <p>This is how we make the World better,<br>
          for our generation, and moreso for the new generation, and all those yet to come.</p>
        <p>We can&apos;t hope for change,<br>
          and not grow to meet that demand ourselves.</p>
        <p>The change we need,<br>
          is driven by Permanent Inheritance of Culture of Wisdom for all generations to come.</p>
        <p>A Fine Culture, is self repairing, and it always heals,<br>
          it towers over forces of poverty, pain, bondage, fear, anger, hopelessness, shyness, and loneliness.</p>
        <p>And a fine culture is what we expect of the adults that we meet as children,<br>
          once we become this culture, and the children learn that it is real.</p>
        <p>The children will see it as an actual, realistic aim to grow into,<br>
          and they will enter a culture of beginning their lives, by resuming at the point where we leave off.</p>
        <p>In order for Humanity to Grow,<br>
          a Central Universal Culture of Knowledge, Wisdom, and Excellence, should emerge.</p>
        <p>A Central Meeting Point,<br>
          for all cultures that choose to leave bad ideas behind and converge on Wisdom and Peace.</p>
