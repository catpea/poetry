        <p>Back when I was a Teenager,<br>
          one late Friday afternoon.</p>
        <p>I had a nap, so amazing,<br>
          I have never forgotten about it.</p>
        <p>I woke up light as a feather,<br>
          and I dressed beautifully.</p>
        <p>And went exploring,<br>
          little Coffee Shops in Plymouth.</p>
        <p>I went to see The Brew Ha Ha,<br>
          full of Mighty Minds with Extreme Dreams.</p>
        <p>I peeked into Coffee Studio,<br>
          and saw Angel-headed Hipsters reading Tolstoy.</p>
        <p>I poked into The Bean,<br>
          full of Dirty Hippies, reciting Beautiful Poetry.</p>
        <p>I made my way back home,<br>
          walking alone through streets of gold.</p>
        <p>I read Chaucer,<br>
          programmed Visual Basic.</p>
        <p>And went back to sleep,<br>
          full of new memories that I would keep.</p>
