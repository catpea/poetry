        <p>No one regrets becoming wise,<br>
          no adult ever wished to stay a child.</p>
        <p>All the grownups,<br>
          embrace the powers they developed.</p>
        <p>You can see it in the way<br>
          they Nobly &amp; Calmly carry themselves.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>The time meant for your growing up,<br>
          should not be disrupted in any way.</p>
        <p>Growing up,<br>
          is not as random as it seems.</p>
        <p>Your own observations,<br>
          will create questions.</p>
        <p>Questions will sprout affinities,<br>
          and affinities will draw you towards places with answers.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Growing up, begins with simple questions, and simple answers,<br>
          but we amass a library of twisty little passages.</p>
        <p>Later in life,<br>
          we apply those passages other things.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>We face the Universe,<br>
          and there are consequences to all our actions.</p>
        <p>What do we do when the bullies come?<br>
          We learn to practice restraint, so that we don&apos;t end up the snarling beasts they are.</p>
        <p>What do we do, when people belittle us, step on us?<br>
          We expand our own sense of Dignity, and Nobility into an Independent Universe free of their flaws and limitations.</p>
        <p>And how do we stand up against Isolation, or being Cast Away?<br>
          With Unbreakability, Fortitude, Courage and Honor.</p>
        <p>The meaning of life?<br>
          The meaning of life is always found in Love.</p>
        <p>And how do we learn to see and rise and better ourselves?<br>
          With Insight; and Foresight; and Understanding; and Authenticity; and Heroism;</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>My Dear Friends,</p>
        <p>Your growing up,<br>
          is the very Formation of you.</p>
        <p>This is not a process that anyone is allowed to interrupt,<br>
          you are not allowed to have anybody step in your way.</p>
        <p>It is like learning to walk,<br>
          no one is allowed to push you to the ground.</p>
        <p>I don&apos;t know if there is anything more sacred,<br>
          than your growing up.</p>
        <p>You must learn to push what is not important away,<br>
          you must get comfortable with not following.</p>
        <p>And you must stand your ground, or walk your path...<br>
          You must, lead.</p>
        <p>You must make sure that you rise a little higher each and every day,<br>
          and that each day adds to the previous.</p>
        <p>Growing Up Is Sacred,<br>
          It Is Your Right.</p>
