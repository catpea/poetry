        <p>Your Lifeline - the cumulative choices you made that affected your entire life,<br>
          must be precisely aligned to match who you are, so that you may learn.</p>
        <p>This is not an easy thing,<br>
          but there can be no other.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>We live in a world under constant erosion from Poverty,<br>
          Authenticity is a difficult path.</p>
        <p>Stay safe, love yourself,
          but you must also stand your ground.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>What life is pressing you into,<br>
          and the path that you must be on for your wisdom sake;</p>
        <p>Are likely to be some distance apart,<br>
          this is the tragedy of our modern age.</p>
        <p>The complexity of life, will be pushing you away,<br>
          from the line you need to walk to learn and become wise.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>The path that life is trying to press you into,<br>
          is almost truly random, it comes out of misery and chance.</p>
        <p>The path mere life dictates includes lies and manipulations that you can&apos;t see at first,<br>
          people will use your innocence against you, to make their lives simpler.</p>
        <p>When you follow, you fall into cogs of ravenous emergent machinery,<br>
          and this machinery exists, because, followers gather.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>My Dear Friends, if you must,<br>
          then know that there is but one you serve.</p>
        <p>The Wisest You, The Best You, The Most Brilliant You,<br>
          at the Greatest Age of Your Life, Your Golden Age of Wisdom.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>The path that mere life dictates, is a melody out of tune,<br>
          you become a piano key, and life will keep pushing, non-stop.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>But the path you dictate, is very unusual in deed,<br>
          because each step you take, adds to the previous.</p>
        <p>And with only a few steps,<br>
          you are stepping higher, you are already building, up.</p>
        <p>That is the same &quot;up&quot;, that &quot;Grow Up&quot; uses,<br>
          your own step, followed by you own step, forward and up.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>If you dare to throw caution into the wind,<br>
          it will bring you wisdom - you&apos;ll see.</p>
        <p>But other than that, like a cat,<br>
          walk cautiously onward.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>When things start adding up,<br>
          you will surpass your younger self.</p>
        <p>And now, where you used to think: &quot;And where am I actually going?&quot;,<br>
          you will see a road ahead, by subtle analogy to the road you&apos;ve already traveled.</p>
        <p>Where once you toyed with the question of &quot;Who am I?&quot;,<br>
          you will now, see you.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>You&apos;ll make little mistakes, and that is OK,<br>
          because you will have your path to fall back on.</p>
        <p>And those mistaken tangents, will cradle you,<br>
          they will add, and refine your decision-making.</p>
        <p>When you walk your own path,<br>
          you do not make big mistakes.</p>
        <p>The little ones will teach about the bigger ones,<br>
          by subtle analogy.</p>
        <p>Your own path,<br>
          is a great teacher.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>So what is it like,<br>
          on that path?</p>
        <p>I am very sorry to say, it is lonely,<br>
          but loneliness is correct.</p>
        <p>Not until you find your other half,<br>
          will loneliness let go of you.</p>
        <p>It is there to remind you,<br>
          that you can only make it half-way on your own.</p>
        <p>Your own path,<br>
          is above all; clear.</p>
        <p>There are no excuses,<br>
          nothing to sway you.</p>
        <p>The air is crisp,<br>
          there is no smog.</p>
        <p>Just,<br>
          a clear vision.</p>
        <p>Even without any guarantees in life,<br>
          you will become stronger.</p>
        <p>But, yes - no matter how beautiful you become,<br>
          Universe will do nothing to guarantee you, anything.</p>
        <p>This,<br>
          is the Leap of Faith.</p>
        <p>And the faith,<br>
          is in Your Greater Self.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Walk your own path, because in the first half of your life,<br>
          your own path is the only thing that can add to you.</p>
        <p>Authenticity, is a law of the Universe,<br>
          it follows similar principles.</p>
        <p>Walk your own path,<br>
          and expand.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>The first steps are always clumsy,<br>
          I went to the museums.</p>
        <p>A coffee shop is a bad idea,<br>
          because everyone is there.</p>
        <p>But a museum is different,<br>
          it filters for kindness, somehow.</p>
        <p>I went to the D.I.A<br>
          I was extremely lucky.</p>
        <p>They were showing,
          Auguste Rodin&apos;s work.</p>
        <p>I understood it immediately, the secret of sculpture,<br>
          is to enlarge that part that holds the soul.</p>
        <p>At the end,<br>
          they had The Waltz (possibly a large replica as it had more detail, this was some 13 years ago), that dancing couple by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camille_Claudel">Camille Claudel</a>.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0088-lavalse.jpg" alt="The Waltz"></p>
        <p>I started crying,<br>
          her hand, had so much feeling in that gentle arch, there was so much touch.</p>
        <p>That is life,<br>
          that is the path.</p>
        <p>The path, where you cry out of beauty,<br>
          and not cry out of being lost.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>And you have to create art,<br>
          art is about training yourself for success.</p>
        <p>Learning,
          by subtle analogy.</p>
        <p>That&apos;s why you never finish,<br>
          there is no time for the art it self.</p>
        <p>There is only time,<br>
          for learning life.</p>
        <p>Learning by subtle analogy,<br>
          to the smaller Triumph, and Success.</p>
        <p>Stick to a single subject,<br>
          until you fill it completely.</p>
        <p>Now you can hang it up at the coffee shop,<br>
          but keep moving forward.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Do not Follow, My Friends,<br>
          there is nothing there to be found.</p>
        <p>Nothing you find when you follow,<br>
          will add together to make a whole.</p>
        <p>When it feels like you are surrounded by paths,<br>
          and there is nowhere to go, or you can&apos;t go into enough places.</p>
        <p>That is an illusion,<br>
          all those paths are false.</p>
        <p>Turn around,<br>
          slow down.</p>
        <p>Go back to the last thing that <em>moved</em> you,<br>
          and fearlessly resume at that point.</p>
        <p>The world may shake and shudder,<br>
          and there will be &quot;Why?&quot;, and &quot;How could you?&quot;, and &quot;What is going on?&quot;.</p>
        <p>All those cries,<br>
          are for the person that follows.</p>
        <p>Each asking you to a different path,
          and all those paths are mutually incompatible.</p>
        <p>Do you see,<br>
          life wants you to merely be.</p>
        <p>But you <em>can</em> be more,<br>
          you don&apos;t have to call it Growing Up, Courage, Authenticity or Growing Content of Character.</p>
        <p>Call it, and appointment at D.I.A.<br>
          call it, a meeting at the UofM Museum of Natural History.</p>
        <p>Begin keeping a Moleskine Journal,<br>
          use a pencil,<br>
          only draw what your heart sees,<br>
          and write as little as possible,<br>
          write to your older self,<br>
          explain to her why?</p>
        <p>Find your center,<br>
          find your balance.</p>
        <p>Lean on your Nucleus,<br>
          and push off to take your steps in your own direction.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Calm your hand,<br>
          slow your time.</p>
        <p>There are decades ahead,<br>
          and you have to be seen.</p>
        <p>Show yourself,<br>
          create future.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>What others have, may shine,<br>
          but is not always gold they keep.</p>
        <p>The younger we are,<br>
          the less wisdom we hold;</p>
        <p>The less wisdom,<br>
          the more questions we should answer.</p>
        <p>And questions combined with life,<br>
          make for a busy time in deed.</p>
        <p>So slow down,<br>
          answer your questions - first.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>All life is sacred,<br>
          all Lifelines equally matter.</p>
        <p>But not all will arrive at their Golden Age of Wisdom,<br>
          without regrets.</p>
        <p>So, please,<br>
          ask your older self what her regrets are.</p>
        <p>And the higher you grow, the more you know, and which is more,<br>
          the more in harmony with your older-self, you&apos;ll be.</p>
