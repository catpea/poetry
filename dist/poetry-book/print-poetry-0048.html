        <p>Did you know, that we can&apos;t grow,<br>
          unless our lessons connect together?<br>
          We learn the way we navigate cities.</p>
        <p>If we leap from one city center, to another...<br>
          we will not know, where to go, or what to do.<br>
          None of the roads will make any sense.</p>
        <p>To divide knowledge into subjects,<br>
          and encourage cramming, and memorization,<br>
          and force remembering over understanding.</p>
        <p>That is not Education, or Knowledge.<br>
          We can no more leap between subjects,<br>
          than hobbies, or families.</p>
        <p>What connects two things together,<br>
          is as important as the things themselves.</p>
        <p>We only learn when two connect,<br>
          and, then the two connect to a third one,<br>
          and next one, to no end.</p>
        <p>We need a pleasant memorable,<br>
          unbroken chain of curiosities,<br>
          that we can slide up and down, when need be.</p>
        <p>Disconnected snippets,<br>
          that we not know what to do with,<br>
          are not useful to us.</p>
