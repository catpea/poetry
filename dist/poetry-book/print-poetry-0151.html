        <p>It has been a quarter of a century, but I still remember the sounds of New York,<br>
          I can almost hear the busy parks, and cars and the occasional police siren.</p>
        <p>I still remember that a slice of New York Pizza across the street,<br>
          is one dollar and twenty five cents, I am sure no pizza takes that! amazing anymore.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>And, wow, to this day I cannot get over the fact,<br>
          that five cents is bigger than ten.</p>
        <p>With each passing year I bemoan the injustice,<br>
          of December not being the tenth month, and October not being the eight.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>While I never had a problem with fractions and the sixteenth of an inch,<br>
          glancing 9/16 or 7/8 on a piece of paper, makes me want to begin with a calculator in hand.</p>
        <p>I never figured out how to spell the word &quot;W&quot;, I know it is written as a letter, but how do you spell it,<br>
          and I love that the letter &quot;W&quot; may actually mean Double-U; fantastic.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>My biggest problem is with Weather,<br>
          as I never really switched to the Fahrenheit scale.</p>
        <p>It just shows that you can take a mam out of the metric system,<br>
          but you can&apos;t take the metric system out of a man.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>My reptile brain just accepted somehow that every few months it gets boiling hot outside,<br>
          during hot summers, I catch my self staring at my thermometer that extra second longer,</p>
        <p>and slowly I go... What the ffffffff.. it is a hundred and five,<br>
          shut the FFront door.</p>
