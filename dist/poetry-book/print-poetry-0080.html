        <p>I wrote a new workout program, Holy Molly,<br>
          surely this will turn out to be another folly.</p>
        <p>It will make me jog fast like lightening,<br>
          I think a lot of people will find my wobbles very frightening.</p>
        <p>Certainly it will make me dance in the streets,<br>
          as I shuffle and jog to my favorite beats.</p>
        <p>And it already crossed my mind to jog with a tail,<br>
          but I don&apos;t want all the quarantined people to go even more pale.</p>
        <p>I just executed the program and it said: play-list done,<br>
          so I am already stretching my drumsticks for the run.</p>
        <p>The play-list is several hours long,<br>
          it will surely make me very strong.</p>
