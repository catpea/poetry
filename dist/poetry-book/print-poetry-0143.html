        <p>Growing up, getting up, moving up, rising up,<br>
          we each have this abstract sense of a special direction.</p>
        <p>It calls to us when we are down,<br>
          and it calls when we <strong>can</strong> go higher.</p>
        <p>You don&apos;t even need to speak a language,<br>
          just lift you finger and point to the sky.</p>
        <p>It works for everything and every time,<br>
          it encourages us to continue to rise.</p>
        <p>There is always an up,<br>
          and never an end in sight.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Growing up demands that we open our eyes and rise,<br>
          stand our ground and look to the skies.</p>
        <p>So as long as we aim for the tallest of mountains and rise,<br>
          our knowledge will quickly catch up in size.</p>
        <p>Wherever we begin, we <strong>can</strong> rise,<br>
          to grow in wisdom to no end, <strong>is</strong> the ultimate prize.</p>
        <p>May we each discover our path to wisdom and rise,<br>
          cheerfully becoming mighty and wise.</p>
