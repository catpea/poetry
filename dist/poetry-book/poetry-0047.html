        <p>Think of a trickster, a real bad fool.</p>
        <p>What a great robbery it would be.<br>
          If your parents sent you to college.<br>
          And teachers sold disconnected snippets.<br>
          And called it knowledge.</p>
        <p>And wouldn&apos;t it be convenient,<br>
          if you could chose you next batch.<br>
          Wouldn&apos;t the trickster rejoice,<br>
          had you called, that, a choice.</p>
        <p>And then at the end of the day.<br>
          When hard earned money was taken.<br>
          You wouldn&apos;t even be shaking,<br>
          even though it was worse than a break-in.</p>
        <p>Think of a trickster, a real bad fool,<br>
          that took away your very own school.</p>
        <p>The moral of this story,<br>
          is that you should think through,<br>
          when someone offers to teach you.</p>
        <p>Education, requires that you learn on your own,<br>
          that something that teaching can only postpone.</p>
