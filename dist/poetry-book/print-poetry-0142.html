        <p>A Powerful Summer Storm approached with mighty thunder and powerful showers,<br>
          and as always my power went out for for some twenty four hours.</p>
        <p>I love Mother Nature and her Cosmic Powers,<br>
          with this much rain there can only be more blooming flowers.</p>
        <p>But, yah, as soon as the power went out,<br>
          my apartment went completely dark.</p>
        <p>My air conditioning was gone too;<br>
          I tried to turn on the window fan before I realized &quot;I need to think that one through.&quot;</p>
        <p>All my extravagantly blinking computers and phones,<br>
          either shutdown or chirped their sad little low-battery tones.</p>
        <p>I watched the sun go down with a sigh,<br>
          and so the only thing left blinking was the smoke detectors and I.</p>
