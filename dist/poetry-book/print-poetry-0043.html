        <p>Captain&apos;s Log, Quarantine, Day Thirty Eight,<br>
          My salads are working great!</p>
        <p>I have lost even more weight,<br>
          and I can&apos;t even count how many I ate.</p>
        <p>It is a marvelous diet of incredible proportions,<br>
          I don&apos;t track my calories, or even my portions.</p>
        <p>I just make a salad once or twice,<br>
          and with strawberry jam, it tastes like paradise.</p>
        <p>And yes, I still continue improving and experimenting,<br>
          Today, I added Jalapenos for a little spicy augmenting.</p>
        <p>It is a strange magical thing,<br>
          but Sugary Jam and Jalapenos are king.</p>
        <p>It is not all sugar and spice, as yesterday I cried,<br>
          I added and ate an whole onion so angry, I almost died.</p>
        <p>So it is not just strawberry jam anymore,<br>
          blueberry works just as well, maybe even more.</p>
        <p>To all the diet people out there,<br>
          join me in my venture,<br>
          add a spoon jam,<br>
          and taste the adventure.</p>
