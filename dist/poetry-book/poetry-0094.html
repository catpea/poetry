        <p>My Friends, liars happen, because it is easiest to live on the low,<br>
          and never rise, and just hide in the status quo.</p>
        <p>That&apos;s why we often run into a trouble maker,<br>
          it takes no effort to be a faker.</p>
        <p>Leave them, to their own stupid little prison,<br>
          in their web of lies, there cannot be any reason.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>That&apos;s our first shaky step in life,<br>
          to lean to see who&apos;s hiding a knife.</p>
        <p>And then cutting with a sword,<br>
          and setting ourselves free to move onward.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>I promise You, it gets better after this,<br>
          the sun will rise, life will become bliss.</p>
        <p>With each step we take we find more light,<br>
          and baby-step by baby-step, add to our might.</p>
        <p>It is as simple as the math of standing-still versus learning,<br>
          one goes nowhere, and the other eventually fulfills all yearning.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Walk Your path, don&apos;t let the fakers sway You,<br>
          look them in the eyes, and see right through.</p>
        <p>Choose the real over the fantasy they sell,<br>
          and move away from their stupid little hell.</p>
        <p>And if someone ever comes pushing You around,<br>
          use the might of Your wisdom to push them back, and stand Your ground.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>There are so many sweet little treasures within You,<br>
          the one You start with will show You heights You never knew.</p>
        <p>And the higher You rise the more brightly You will glow,<br>
          and You&apos;ll find Your Sweetheart, before You know.</p>
        <p>Life is meant to be lived in Wisdom and Happiness and Laughter,<br>
          Heaven is Right Now - not in some fantasy of after.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>All the things that are worthy of the Beautiful You,<br>
          will never extract a toll, they will only ever add unto You.</p>
        <p>Nobody worthy of You could ever make You feel sad or bad,<br>
          they will foolishly trot and prance to Your rescue, until You feel glad.</p>
        <p>Don&apos;t let fakers trick You into thinking the world is blue,<br>
          The sun, is right over the next mountain, and is already shining for You.</p>
