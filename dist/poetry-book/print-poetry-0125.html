        <p>Great Adventures need not take you far,<br>
          and ultimately, wherever you go there you are.</p>
        <p>But still, there <strong>is</strong> something special about new places,<br>
          we see more deeply, and get in good graces.</p>
        <p>I think the kind of adventure, that <strong>really</strong> is the best,<br>
          will make you start keeping a little journal to document your quest.</p>
        <p>When there is time to think about all the things and little bits,<br>
          even the slightest curiosity will bring about new wits.</p>
        <p>So fill all the journal pages, and leave it for later,<br>
          because you never know when a little journal may become something greater.</p>
        <p>It could come as a surprise that this little adventure you took,<br>
          turned you into a Famous Writer and became your first Adventure Book!</p>
