        <p>Captain&apos;s Log, Quarantine Fiveever, Day Twenty Three.</p>
        <p>It was a super busy day, not a moment for tea.</p>
        <p>And I keep Programming late into the night,</p>
        <p>typing like a Lion with all his might.</p>
        <p>This morn, I woke up and made Peanut Butter and Jelly,</p>
        <p>I&apos;ve been programming all day, I keep going like the telly.</p>
        <p>Now, I am trying to figure out, a datatype for verse,</p>
        <p>my stanza CSS padding and margins are intense.</p>
        <p>I am not trying to be a hero, hey!</p>
        <p>but I am writing this, in a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array">JavaScript Array</a>!</p>
        <p>I don&apos;t know if there is anymore I can say,</p>
        <p>other than that I am OK,</p>
        <p>and that this has been an OK day.</p>
        <p>No wait, I&apos;ll add this:</p>
        <p>I wish everyone pure bliss!</p>
