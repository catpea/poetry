        <p>There cannot be jogging without acting crazy,<br>
          if you&apos;re not snarling and spitting you&apos;re just being lazy.</p>
        <p>Not to mention that its discussing to swallow those little files,<br>
          you&apos;re not supposed to <strong>keep</strong> them, they&apos;re not your prize.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, it makes no difference what race it may be,<br>
          manners go out the window, the moment you bend your knee.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Plus, nobody really runs to win the race,<br>
          we just set the correct pace and run to find our place in Space.</p>
        <p>The physical challenge is found in taking each step,<br>
          and not stopping until the last rep.</p>
        <p>But that&apos;s easy, it is the simplest thing about it all,<br>
          your body just gets used to it, and has a ball.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Jogging is mostly a little reminder that we are to turn our life to Art,<br>
          that we are to overcome our limits, and become super smart.</p>
        <p>The actual achievement is found in finishing what we start,<br>
          and the thousand other things we finish, by <em>subtle analogy</em> to this odd Art.</p>
        <p>In a word, we jog for our future selves,<br>
          so that they may become <strong>proud</strong> of themselves.</p>
