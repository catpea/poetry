        <p>Don&apos;t let them put you on a school bus.<br>
          Tell you parents, school is crazy!</p>
        <p>And anyway,<br>
          they shouldn&apos;t be so lazy.</p>
        <p>You will need all the games,<br>
          and you memorize <em>no</em> presidential names.</p>
        <p>You demand a trip to every national park.<br>
          because you will not spend you life in the dark.</p>
        <p>You will need every audio-book ever made,<br>
          and only then will you go through life unafraid.</p>
