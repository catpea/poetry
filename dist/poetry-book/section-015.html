        <p>To rise, to become strong, to grow and to break away and become more authentic,<br>
          is our first great responsibility, and our health.</p>
        <p>However, it does go against our nature as children,<br>
          we have a tendency not to look outside of the culture we are brought into.</p>
        <p>Rite of Passage is about crossing that line,<br>
          the line between The Child That Follows, and The Adult That Leads.</p>
        <p>The moment we can handle looking at ourselves and our culture,<br>
          from the <strong>outside</strong> in, we begin crossing the line into adulthood.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>One of the first few thoughts may be, &quot;But what if I was born into a different religion?&quot;<br>
          followed by, &quot;What if I was not born into this economic class, into this poverty?&quot;.</p>
        <p>As these questions grow from asking about ourselves, to also including others,<br>
          they bring us insight into the greater Human Condition.</p>
        <p>Bring us to the question of The Freedom of Will, of how much our Personality is Our Own,<br>
          of internal decision making heavily influenced by external culture or placement.</p>
        <p>As we grow we begin asking even greater questions about others,<br>
          &quot;Would the petty thief stole, had he <strong>not</strong> been fractured by the virus of poverty?&quot;</p>
        <p>Our minds begin scanning for solutions that aim towards a Greater Good,<br>
          towards Word Peace, International Convergence on Wisdom, Unites States of The World.</p>
        <p>We begin seeing that although there isn&apos;t an answer to every question,<br>
          there are Dreams that could prevent the worst of World&apos;s Mistakes.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Building schools to help a culture grow,<br>
          instead of forecasting war and manufacturing enough weapons.</p>
        <p>Preventing the existence of criminals,<br>
          by helping little children to Happy Homes, and to a Universal Basic Income.</p>
        <p>Trading simple schools and grades for Business Success,<br>
          helping children to become Well Funded Entrepreneurs and Investors.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>No matter which questions we begin with and how our path is arranged,<br>
          we discover how critical Growing Up is, for us, for eveyone.</p>
        <p>How much more we are,<br>
          than mere followers of the rules that we are born to.</p>
        <p>How important to our mental health,<br>
          it is not to fall a victim to bad ideas or fractures of poverty.</p>
        <p>Our First Great Act in life is lifting ourselves above the culture we are born into,<br>
          that is the meaning of the words Rising, Growing Up, Breaking Away, Becoming Stronger.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>And the acts of independent thinking that are sure to follow,<br>
          are the very foundation of Our Hope in a Better Future.</p>
        <p>Have no fear of Rising, of Breaking Away, of Growing Up, of Growing In Strength,<br>
          for that is Adulthood, and none can stay children for long.</p>
        <p>Close your eyes, and begin building,<br>
          because your next step is to become a Great Being.</p>

        <p>No worries, the only real darkness is the Twilight of Hesitation,<br>
          it is dangerous because it makes time go by all too fast.</p>
        <p>So you just have to make a promise to your self,<br>
          that each day will be a tiny-tiny itsy-bitsy better; than then previous.</p>
        <p>Other than that, no cloud could ever stop the sun from rising,<br>
          nothing can endanger your brilliance, there is nothing to fear.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>And brilliance,<br>
          brilliance leads to enlightenment.</p>
        <p>So as long as you protect your light,<br>
          know that wisdom is your right.</p>
        <p>Never stand still and always take to flight,<br>
          yours is enlightenment, the brightest of light.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Never has there been a night,<br>
          that was wasn&apos;t lit by light.</p>
        <p>Never has there been a fight,<br>
          that wasn&apos;t won by Wisdom&apos;s Might.</p>
        <p>Rise, rise in spite of the fright,<br>
          rise to no end in sight.</p>

        <p>Anything that can go wrong may go wrong,<br>
          and there is only one guarantee in life.</p>
        <p>It is a guarantee, precisely because it is within our complete control,<br>
          the guarantee is The Greatness Of Our Soul, or Spirit, or Being.</p>
        <p>It means you will keep getting up no matter how many times you fall,<br>
          it means you will continue moving forward without stopping.</p><br>
        <p>It means there is no pain, it means there is no weakness,<br>
          that it is a function and fact of life that we advance forward.</p>
        <p>And on the day of triumph,<br>
          it means that the prize is nothing less than Laughter and Joy of Life.</p>
        <p>The Greatness of Our Soul, our single guarantee in life,<br>
          may begin in discomfort, but it concludes with something <strong>far</strong> more.</p><br>
        <p>Marvels of the Human Spirit that we can&apos;t directly conjure up within ourselves,<br>
          marvels that can only come out of our Might and Authenticity.</p>
        <p>Humor and Foolishness, Cheerfulness and Bliss,<br>

        <p>For those of you who had trouble,
          finding the Northern end of the I-275 Bicycle Tail.</p>
        <p>Hines connects North and South parts,<br>
          but it is really hard to find the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/AimpKxWarbhiX8zbA">North Entry Point</a></p>
        <p>I got on my bicycle today,<br>
          and took some pictures.</p>
        <p>You have to find the M-14 Overpass,<br>
          or an Overpass with a huge dark rail beneath.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0119-ramp-rail.jpg" alt="Ramp Rail"></p>
        <p>That rail is the support beam,<br>
          for the Trail On-ramp.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0119-ramp-hiding.jpg" alt="Ramp Hiding"></p>
        <p>A bit further down the road,<br>
          there is a road that leads up to the On-ramp.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0119-ramp-access.jpg" alt="Ramp Access"></p>
        <p>It is a ramp specially made,<br>
          for the Handsome Adventurous Bicyclist.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0119-ramp-meow.jpg" alt="Ramp Meow"></p>
        <p>It opens like the door to a secret garden,<br>
          very few people bicycle there.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0119-continues.jpg" alt="Continues"></p>
        <p>The trail continues for many more miles,<br>
          all the way up to 14 Mile Road.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0119-forever.jpg" alt="Forever"></p>
        <p>Over at 14 Mile it ends wonderfully unceremoniously,<br>
          it just pops out onto a sidewalk.</p>
        <p>Where motorists jump in their cars slightly,<br>
          as you pop out somewhat dehydrated, a little crazed, and a bit wild.</p>

        <p>Back when I was a Teenager,<br>
          one late Friday afternoon.</p>
        <p>I had a nap, so amazing,<br>
          I have never forgotten about it.</p>
        <p>I woke up light as a feather,<br>
          and I dressed beautifully.</p>
        <p>And went exploring,<br>
          little Coffee Shops in Plymouth.</p>
        <p>I went to see The Brew Ha Ha,<br>
          full of Mighty Minds with Extreme Dreams.</p>
        <p>I peeked into Coffee Studio,<br>
          and saw Angel-headed Hipsters reading Tolstoy.</p>
        <p>I poked into The Bean,<br>
          full of Dirty Hippies, reciting Beautiful Poetry.</p>
        <p>I made my way back home,<br>
          walking alone through streets of gold.</p>
        <p>I read Chaucer,<br>
          programmed Visual Basic.</p>
        <p>And went back to sleep,<br>
          full of new memories that I would keep.</p>

        <p>In the beginning we discover our Universal Self,<br>
          the Being we are, regardless, of what Culture or Place we are born into.</p>
        <p>Then we set an aim, by asking our Elder Selves what heir regrets are,<br>
          the more we advance forward the more we become Ourselves.</p>
        <p>The less regrets our Elder Selves have,<br>
          the more we become in harmony with ourselves.</p>
        <p>The Way Of The Warrior, is a self correcting path,<br>
          each time we advance we become stronger, wiser, and more powerful.</p>
        <p>Frame after frame, as time ticks away, and our minds and bodies grow,<br>
          we near, and finally become; our Elder Selves.</p>
        <p>We arrive with Certainty of Knowing that the path we traveled was our own,<br>
          that we are in Harmony with Universe, that all our Senses are Finely Tuned.</p>
        <p>In moving forward we don&apos;t need to ask what life is for,<br>
          Life is for the Living, for those who grow and advance forward.</p>
        <p>There cannot be any real regrets as we had decades to avoid them,<br>
          and whatever obstacles there were, we never lost our way.</p>
        <p>The Final Aim, is to rise all the way up, and become a Great Being,<br>
          to build a legacy of Wisdom and Good Ideas, Lessons Worth Sharing, and Moving Inspiration.</p>
