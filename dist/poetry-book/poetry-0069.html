        <p>Some adventurers,<br>
          wrestle bears.</p>
        <p>Others,<br>
          runaway from their fathers.</p>
        <p>I,<br>
          bemoan the lack of Wi-Fi.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>That is, until the night comes about,<br>
          at which point all the wild creatures come out.</p>
        <p>I&apos;ve heard stories of owls swooping down from the air,<br>
          just to rip out whatever is left of a man&apos;s hair.</p>
        <p>Then there are the occasional mad deer,<br>
          always shimmy-shammying around like they had a beer.</p>
        <p>The coyotes are especially frightening,<br>
          they come in groups, flashing their eyes like lightening.</p>
        <p>One time I tried to turn on a flashlight,<br>
          as it turned out - to all the big spider&apos;s delight.</p>
        <p>Let me tell ya, It takes a man with a lot of brass,<br>
          not to scream, when a spider crawls out with a huge glowing ass.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Once, an older lady from a near by camp went to get more booze from her car,<br>
          and then misjudged her distance, and walked back too far.</p>
        <p>I was sleeping on the ground in my tiny tent,<br>
          and then all of a sudden she started yelling out in her lost torment.</p>
        <p>Of course, in the middle of the night, and woods and my sleep,<br>
          she didn&apos;t sound like a lady but rather some huge creepy creep.</p>
        <p>She found her way back, and I am sure they partied hard,<br>
          but not knowing what made all those screams, I slept - on guard.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Porcupines, oh, you&apos;ve never seen one like I did,<br>
          it was huge, covered in spikes, and really fit.</p>
        <p>It could outrun a car or two,<br>
          probably, bite a tire and chew.</p>
        <p>But then I came across a sign,<br>
          and it turned out that the biggest creature, was not the Porcupine,</p>
        <p>I was always pretty happy that none of the creatures that bite,<br>
          could actually take me down in a single swipe.</p>
        <p>But the sign read, <strong>Beware Of Bear</strong><br>
          and that to me was the biggest scare.</p>
