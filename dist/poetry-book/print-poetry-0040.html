        <p>Captain&apos;s Log, Quarantine, Day Thirty Five.</p>
        <p>I am not sure that the end of quarantine will ever arrive,<br>
          so I am preparing to write enough poetry to fill a hard drive.</p>
        <p>I think I shall begin writing about cats,<br>
          and then complain a bit about bureaucrats.</p>
        <p>When I am done complaining,<br>
          I shall pick something more entertaining.</p>
        <p>Like perhaps musing about Lowbrow Art,<br>
          and then carry on babbling about someone smart.</p>
        <p>Maybe a Scientist, or a Philosopher like Descartes,<br>
          or maybe a colorful leader like Napoleon Bonaparte.</p>
        <p>Then, when, I&apos;ll run out of things to babble on,<br>
          I will jump on my bicycle and set off at dawn,</p>
        <p>I&apos;ll bring my notepad and a pen,<br>
          and come up with a new idea,<br>
          every now and then.</p>
