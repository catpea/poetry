        <p>We are granted Consciousness,<br>
          but given no guarantees by the Universe.</p>
        <p>The only guarantee we have is Ourselves,<br>
          the one Element that we are truly in control of.</p>
        <p>The deliberate act of Growing Up,<br>
          is a constant reminder of that control.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Dusk and Twilight, Tears in the Rain, and Aches in Every Muscle,<br>
          surrounded by Unfairness, Blindness, Ends Everywhere, and yet we Rise.</p>
        <p>Though it may be the very end of some world,<br>
          we are never robbed of the choice to keep going forward.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>The choice to exert control over the walls that the Universe has us up against,<br>
          when all else has gone dark, the choice always remains.</p>
        <p>And when we can no longer change the World,<br>
          then we have to grow up to gain new powers that fit that world better.</p>
        <p>The new powers will, alter the world,<br>
          and eventually we will find our way back home.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>No matter what misery or battles mark our past,<br>
          having chosen to Rise, and Learn, and Rebuild; made us Beautiful.</p>
        <p>No matter what challenges lie ahead,<br>
          The Great Act of Growing Up, is an Inexhaustible Source of Unlimited Wisdom.</p>
        <p>And the sum of it all,<br>
          is the Great Health and Joy of Life.</p>
