        <p>I always try hard to learn something new,<br>
          so that my elder self can mumble &quot;I grew.&quot;</p>
        <p>I try to listen to a non-fiction book or two,<br>
          to update my general world view.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>And I do computer programming and research too,<br>
          I have lots of bookmarks in my queue.</p>
        <p>I am trying to write programs as if I had a crew,<br>
          so I stick to simple systems where I can think things through.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Learning Life, and Programming somehow fits me like a shoe,<br>
          I&apos;ll have to make a list of the books and papers I read through.</p>
        <p>I never have to try to look for something new,<br>
          there are too many beautiful things to get bored, or blue.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>I like learning about things that are most Human and true,<br>
          trying to figure our what our elder selves wished they knew.</p>
        <p>Someday, I would like to write a book to help young people get a better world view,<br>
          something short and beautiful that they can quickly finish, slam shut, and say &quot;Who knew?&quot;</p>
