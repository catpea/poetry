        <p>Summer and Winter, Spring, and Autumn are my favorite seasons,<br>
          but today, Winter came to mind; for many reasons.</p>
        <p>For one, it is Summer, a Hot Summer, Heatwave in full swing,<br>
          and I can&apos;t believe what great relief; a little snowfall would bring.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0131-walk.jpg" alt="Walk"></p>
        <p>And I found a winter photo of an expedition to a near by store,<br>
          I look thrice my size, I can&apos;t even imagine how many layers I wore.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0131-icycle.jpg" alt="Icycle"></p>
        <p>Then I remembered when back in 2014 the Polar Vortex was all the talk,<br>
          I was so excited to dress up and go on a long walk!</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0131-icycle-smile.jpg" alt="Smile"></p>
        <p>But, my favorite memory is riding my bicycle and hitting a patch of ice,<br>
          I fell sideways upside-down, and did a little looptie-loop, twice.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0131-fall.jpg" alt="Fall"></p>
        <p>I landed perfectly flat with a winter splat kicking up the downy flake,<br>
          and I lay there a bit muttering, &quot;What a story this will make&quot;.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0131-the-end.jpg" alt="The End"></p>
        <p>I love Blinding Summers, and Rainy Autumns, and Spring when all the flowers grow,<br>
          but I am a huge fan of Winter and all that bright white snow.</p>
