        <p>Universe created Evolution, Evolution created Consciousness,<br>
          Consciousness created Humans, and Humans created Philosophy.</p>
        <p>The word Philosophy, comes from the greek Philosophia,<br>
          it means Love of Wisdom.</p>
        <p>It comes from the time when Great Beings first begun emerging among us,<br>
          they rejected inauthenticity, violence, contradiction, and imaginary things and creatures.</p>
        <p>These were the First Superheroes,<br>
          they were often attacked.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0079-socrates.jpg" alt="Socrates"></p>
        <p>This is Socrates, he taught the children power of Wisdom,<br>
          he was sentenced to death, and he did not run, he died, for Wisdom.</p>
        <p>Wisdom is self correcting,<br>
          it eventually went against the State and its imaginary gods, and so the State went against him.</p>
        <p>He outlived the State by becoming immortal,<br>
          he is often seen as the Father of Philosophy, but there were many other thinkers.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0079-hepatia.jpg" alt="Hepatia"></p>
        <p>This is Hepatia, her tragedy, marks the end of the first Philosophers,<br>
          the world plunged into Dark Ages.</p>
        <p>As hard earned as Wisdom is, as long as it takes to cultivate and grow,<br>
          the criminals can take it away in a cold flash of steel.</p>
        <p>Her tragedy, should not be forgotten, the Noblest become a target,<br>
          to the fractured, and blind, and jealous.</p>
        <p>For now, Wisdom is no longer seen as the Highest there is,<br>
          today, opinion seems to matter as much as fact.</p>
        <p>There are calls to &quot;teach controversy&quot;, for &quot;equal debate&quot;,<br>
          to &quot;show both sides&quot;, to &quot;let the reader decide&quot;.</p>
        <p>Falsely presenting a broken opinion,<br>
          to be on par with the reality and fact that helps Humanity Grow.</p>
        <p>It is an old trick, it is cheap, and self assembling,<br>
          it emerges on its own from poverty, inequality, suffering, blindness, and pain.</p>
        <p>Being conscious and self aware, is not quite enough,<br>
          because of Liars, Thieves, Criminals, Murderers, War, and even Poverty.</p>
        <p>Wisdom is like a higher level Operating System for Humans,<br>
          it enhances our consciousness, it grants us unique powers.</p>
        <p>But, Every Human, each member of the Grand Human Family,<br>
          needs to see Wisdom as a necessity.</p>
        <p>Until then, racism, xenophobia, inequality, poverty, and darkness,<br>
          will keep us apart.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0079-soldier.jpg" alt="Soldier"></p>
        <p>The Stories of Superheroes are rooted in lives of Philosophers,<br>
          because a Philosopher cannot be hurt like the ordinary men.</p>
        <p>Philosophers survive for thousands of years in text,<br>
          in stories, in paintings.</p>
        <p>They survive by sharing Wisdom,<br>
          that make us stronger, that enriches us, that we each yearn for.</p>
        <p>When you read the words of a philosopher,<br>
          she or he comes round, and in a way they keep you company.</p>
        <p>Socrates knew that,<br>
          and he knew he needs to send a powerful message far into the future.</p>
        <p>An important being, died for something important,<br>
          he is signaling, that Wisdom is Your Right.</p>
        <p>He was a Soldier,<br>
          he found a way to repair the word.</p>
        <p>And it was,<br>
          Love of Wisdom.</p>
        <p>Once you begun paying attention to it all,<br>
          a constellation of stars will begin assembling in you.</p>
        <p>Each star will repair and strengthen all the others,<br>
          it will bring you health and clarity.</p>
        <p>Your contradictions will begin resolving,<br>
          by rejecting and ejecting that which makes no sense.</p>
        <p>It will help your decision making,<br>
          it won&apos;t let you move forward when two things oppose.</p>
        <p>It will keep you in place,<br>
          until you reject the one that is not fact.</p>
        <p>Where all the other stalks fracture,<br>
          Wisdom will help you bend in the colder winds of change.</p>
        <p>Foresight helps you combine knowledge,<br>
          to construct events that are yet to unfold.</p>
        <p>Moreover, it helps you construct the correct path ahead,<br>
          and reject whatever else may come.</p>
        <p>The Power of Foresight does not end with the individual wielding it,<br>
          it can extend to guiding the word to the correct its paths.</p>
        <p>Heroism is in part is about learning what not to do,<br>
          helping others requires solving their problems, and thus you learn life.</p>
        <p>But the greatest of insights are found in Memoirs worth reading,<br>
          where they are placed in correct context.</p>
        <p>With enough insight Crime for example, transforms from an impenetrable state of mind that it is,<br>
          to our need to create Walls of Prevention, so that people don&apos;t end up blind.</p>
        <p>Punishment and Revenge is not a way to treat a Human Being fractured by poverty,<br>
          or violence, or even hunger-for-food. Only prevention can work here.</p>
        <p>The power of insight shows you that while you can&apos;t go back in time,<br>
          you can prevent the little ones from ending up in the same place.</p>
        <p>In that way, you take the pain of those Punished and use it for a thing that matters,<br>
          preventing children from following in their footsteps.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0079-martorano.jpg" alt="Martorano"></p>
        <p>And we get to feel others,<br>
          we get to feel when they have been Wronged.</p>
        <p>And we get to feel what they felt, when times got tough,<br>
          and the power of Compassion makes us a Family.</p>
        <p>Who was it that gave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnuoHywbaR8">George Martorano</a> that little pencil,<br>
          power of compassion is incredibly complex.</p>
        <p>You hold hands with every wronged being on Earth,<br>
          those looking to their Favorite Star, wondering if someone else is looking there too.</p>
        <p>We are, we all are, we are there with you,<br>
          You matter, your heart mattes, your mind matters, your life matters.</p>
        <p>And in Wisdom we will fix all of it,<br>
          whether we are ready to recognize that or not, we are a Family, and as One, We&apos;ll fix it all.</p>
        <p>In that path we slowly walk together,<br>
          towards Happiness and Fairness, and Joy.</p>
        <p>We will erase poverty and slavery with Universal Income and a Free Home with a picket fence.<br>
          We will erase crime with Care and Prevention, and Fairness.</p>
        <p>We will erase war, blindness and stupidity, with Family Love and Wisdom.<br>
          We will erase all problems that plague the Human Family, it is what a family does.</p>
        <p>One day, the world will stand united in fact,<br>
          as opposed to being divided by opinion.</p>
        <p>Not even the Universe can stand in our way,<br>
          our way is the Human Family Way.</p>
        <p>Like Wisdom,<br>
          we are Unstoppable.</p>

        <p>Why does Philosophy seem so foggy,<br>
          so unclear, and uncertain.</p>
        <p>Living above yourself, transcending your limits,<br>
          puts you in a wiser state, more complex state, harder to understand state.</p>
        <p>I can&apos;t describe that directly,<br>
          but I can describe it by subtle analogy to other things.</p>
        <p>You know how your Dad questionably, pokes around a car engine,<br>
          and yet all of that seems a bit foggy?</p>
        <p>Do you remember what it was like to jog the first time,<br>
          and then you just kept going?</p>
        <p>Can you imagine your first 18 miles at the Appalachian Trail,<br>
          and can you see your last 18 miles as you near Katahdin.</p>
        <p>You know how mathematics sound impenetrable?<br>
          Until you become a mathematician?</p>
        <p>There are gaps, discomforts, vocabularies, perceptual frameworks,<br>
          that stand between you and the wisest you.</p>
        <p>You have to cross those things,<br>
          to unfog your mind.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Learn to jog, to sprint, to body build,<br>
          and find a pathway to your best self by subtle analogy to training.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Learn to backpack,<br>
          to walk out in front of a lone wolf, let your eyes connect in loneliness and familiarity.</p>
        <p>Snarl down a Mountain Lion,<br>
          with a God Like Growl, out of you entire life force, and culminating in a Wild Howl.</p>
        <p>Let your Lycanthropy belch a low rumble as you stand your ground,<br>
          to the test of a charging Black Bear.</p>
        <p>And learn from the Calm and Power of a Grizzly Bear,<br>
          Ursus Horribilis.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Or, become an artist. You don&apos;t need a charging bear to learn.<br>
          You can use clay, or canvas, or music.</p>
        <p>There is no finer way to push loneliness away,<br>
          than to sculpt the meaning of touch.</p>
        <p>And there is no better way to learn courage,<br>
          than to paint a chain of works that inspire to motion.</p>
        <p>And music need not make someone cry to be powerful,<br>
          make the beat move your own feet, as you run your first ultra.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Consider how simple a Desktop in your Operating System is,<br>
          and yet, how perfectly impossible it is, to drag the icon out of the computer.</p>
        <p>It is right there, you can wiggle it,<br>
          and yet it is trapped in a prison, of invisible walls.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>And consider, how different you are, from all the people you have met,<br>
          how you don&apos;t even smile at the things that make them laugh.</p>
        <p>How not a single person of out the Eight Billion,<br>
          could possibly take your place.</p>
        <p>How often it feels that all the people around you are sleepy,<br>
          how some seem different, because they could not do, what they do, if they were not wide awake.</p>
        <p>To integrate with wisdom, you cannot read the same books others read,<br>
          your mind represents a perfectly unique constellation of stars.</p>
        <p>To integrate with wisdom,<br>
          not only do you have to indirectly wiggle around by subtle analogy to other things.</p>
        <p>But you have to fish out just the perfect morsels that fit you,<br>
          in just the perfect sequence, out of a unique collection of mutually reinforcing works of Philosophy.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>You start in the beginning, with Survey Courses, as these outline the most brilliant ideas first,<br>
          there you can recognize thoughts that fit you, that you already had in your constellation.</p>
        <p>Organized Education, poisons your confidence in education, because everything they teach,<br>
          is in an inhuman, synthetic, and impersonal sequence.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the easily forgotten and fragile clusters of incomplete information,<br>
          aim to build on one another, they guarantee you won&apos;t understand, and will only overwhelm you in the end.</p>
        <p>The celebrating of a Diploma, is a sacred ritual, that has been erased, and replaced,<br>
          with a more sugarcoated &quot;I am finally out&quot;.</p>
        <p>This is a perfect recipe for bondage, blindness, weakness,<br>
          and worse.</p>
        <p>We must not allow a fake sugar pop triumph,<br>
          to replace the Real Triumph or Knowledge and Wisdom.</p>
        <p>It can only get worse,<br>
          a day will come when the Libraries will close.</p>
        <p>School and Library, above all, were meant to be a symbol,<br>
          an extension to your own self education.</p>
        <p>Your Education,<br>
          the pathway to Peace, Safety, Security, Self Control, Harmony, Enlightenment.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>What has occurred to cause the fog, is a drop of packets of information,<br>
          we are too complex, the world is too complex, parenting is too complex, teaching is too complex.</p>
        <p>It can get worse, if we continue celebrating false graduations, and fake education,<br>
          if we keep forgetting that our family, has Eight Billion members and each must grow up for real.</p>
        <p>The solution is to remind ourselves, that growing up is not about feeling like an adult,<br>
          but rather Transcending our Limits, and Pushing Through gaps, towards Wisdom.</p>
        <p>We face problems that can only be solved by Intellectual or Cultural Unity.</p>
        <p>The Problem of War, is solved by Education, Wisdom, and Unity.</p>
        <p>The Problem of Education, is solved by Helping Everyone to a Fair Start.</p>
        <p>The Problem of Crime, can be Solved by Mental Heath Care, and Prevention.</p>
        <p>The Problem of Poverty and Slavery, is Solved by Universal Income.</p>
        <p>All these problems are our problems, and the solutions are ours as well.</p>
        <p>But they rest across a Gap, a gap that Humanity must cross.</p>
        <p>And the next step,<br>
          is your step.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Nothing worth your precious time, can be faked, or made up, or make believe,<br>
          it all has to be Authentic, Powerful, Guttural, Raw.</p>
        <p>It will hurt in the Muscle and Bone,<br>
          but eventually you&apos;ll forget to pay attention to what is unimportant.</p>
        <p>You are not to be taught that you are dime a dozen,<br>
          and that they just can&apos;t find a job for you, because you don&apos;t fit or conform.</p>
        <p>People believe this nonsense,<br>
          because they don&apos;t have anything to draw from by subtle analogy.</p>
        <p>That is why we must challenge ourselves to Great Deeds,<br>
          to acquire the experiences necessary to tell Wisdom from Waste.</p>
        <p>When you hear someone putting you down, pushing you around, belittling you,<br>
          you are to leave, because that someone has fractured and broke, and are now ill.</p>
        <p>It is the oldest and sickest trick,<br>
          to convince someone they don&apos;t matter.</p>
        <p>They do it for personal gain, money or laziness,<br>
          to people who do not have a library of Grand Experiences from which they can draw wisdom, by Subtle Analogy.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Get Up.</p>
        <p>Find your temple of solitude, The Two Beautiful Trees, The Bridge Over Hudson River,<br>
          The Highway Overpass, The Starry Beach where the Stars Come Out at Night and mingle with Starfish.</p>
        <p>And know, that you are a Child of The Universe, first,<br>
          That! is your background.</p>
        <p>Now face Humanity anew,<br>
          out from the edge of the Universe.</p>
        <p>Look,<br>
          look at all those things that made you small.</p>
        <p>Look how unimportant the inauthentic is,<br>
          how fragile those words that upset you really were.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>And pay attention, to the real problem,<br>
          how easily you were tricked and mislead.</p>
        <p>That cannot go on,<br>
          you are not a push around.</p>
        <p>I wish you knew how Powerful you really are,<br>
          how easily you learn at your own pace in the sequence that fits you best.</p>
        <p>How All Too Human, all too familiar, all too easy,<br>
          the acquisition of wisdom really is.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Not all Adults are defined by Outspoken Wisdom, some find Greatness in Love Returned,<br>
          and what a Great Power, can those Two even make a mistake?</p>
        <p>I don&apos;t think there is anything other than Love, that can substitute for Wisdom,<br>
          it is both The Love of Two, and The Love of a Big Mother in a large family,<br>
          a Mother that always brings hugs, warm meals and Wisdom.</p>
        <p>But, True Love is rare, so while you search, you must also grow in Wisdom,<br>
          from now on, you will have to learn to tell the children apart from the adults.</p>
        <p>And not by looking at how old they are, or how well they dress, or how sharply they move in their environment,<br>
          you will now look at their Authenticity, and Content of Character.</p>
        <p>No one who lacks in Authenticity, or has little Content of Character,<br>
          has anything to contribute to you life, certainly nothing negative.</p>
        <p>Hope for them to recover, and become wise, and healthy,<br>
          let them know that they are a Child of The Universe, and they count - but go.</p>
        <p>Don&apos;t let anybody hurt you,<br>
          don&apos;t let anybody hurt your heart, or mind.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Go!<br>
          because you need your heart and mind, to grow.</p>
        <p>Go!,<br>
          with the certainty of knowing that you are more.</p>
        <p>Go!,<br>
          so as long as you Rise you won&apos;t be lonely for long.</p>
        <p>Go!<br>
          because there has never been a way other than forward and up.</p>
        <p>Go!<br>
          and don&apos;t be scared, all great journeys start with little things.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>The Others, who went through the same,<br>
          are with you in Spirit.</p>
        <p>So many invisible battles have been fought,<br>
          and as much triumph gone unnoticed.</p>
        <p>The Warriors are everywhere, and they stand by your side,<br>
          you are in company of Great Heroes.</p>
        <p>Climb by subtle analogy to the triumphs already had,<br>
          rise to the highest of mountains.</p>
        <p>You are Meant to Become a Great Being,<br>
          and You are meant to remind others to follow a similar path.</p>
        <p>Rise, and you will be well on your way,<br>
          Humanity only grows, when people like you tear down those thin invisible walls.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Wherever you are right now, begin transcending your limits,<br>
          no matter how small, each will help you learn more.</p>
        <p>With each new success more pathways will become visible to you,<br>
          you are not trapped, you are just at the beginning of your journey.</p>
        <p>It is hard to see it all because you are still learning,<br>
          but it is easy to read or listen to books, and inherit great visions from others.</p>
        <p>It will never get easier,<br>
          but you will grow greater, to a point where ease will become irrelevant to your existence.</p>
        <p>You must use your Heart and Mind to learn all the lessons ahead,<br>
          no one can teach you, you must find your own books.</p>
        <p>By Subtle Analogy,<br>
          Rise to Your Greatness.</p>

        <p>Nothing is what it looks like,<br>
          because Human Beings, are not of the world of sequentially predictable machines.</p>
        <p>Human Beings emerged, out of infinitely increasing complexity,<br>
          by rules of infinite accidents along lines of fuzzy principles.</p>
        <p>In a word, we are here because the Universe mixed it self for so long<br>
          that the failure for life to occur became inconceivable.</p>
        <p>And, we want to believe life emerged, on Earth,<br>
          just like we wanted to believe that earth was the center of the Universe.</p>
        <p>And we want to believe that Earth was the first to have life,<br>
          my goodness, how much more special could we be, the first in the Universe.</p>
        <p>Universe is a large place, that has been around for a long time,<br>
          it is better not to think of anything cosmic, as that! special.</p>
        <p>But there is one exception.</p>
        <p>Once you come down to Earth, come up to Life, and look then Into The Conscious Self Aware Mind,<br>
          that is no longer a common occurrence.</p>
        <p>There is nothing normal about it,<br>
          we are now at the limits of what the Universe could possibly conceive of.</p>
        <p>No machine or hybrid can measure up to the raw power of unleashed consciousness.</p>
        <p>Nothing partially conscious, can know the depth of Sadness,<br>
          nothing less than conscious could know the Miracle of Happiness.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>We are used to thinking of ourselves as work horses,<br>
          great locomotives that can plow through Pandemics, or a Broken Heart.</p>
        <p>But that is a temporary oversimplification just to keep visions clear,<br>
          born of a finely tuned mind that can narrow all views down to the important bits.</p>
        <p>Focus and selective attention is not a limitation of our mind,<br>
          it is a feature that clears away unimportant things.</p>
        <p>When we need recall, we can have it in full,<br>
          just imagine your favorite place, and trace along the walls.</p>
        <p>Every window, picture, appliance, and outlet, all the important knickknacks are all there,<br>
          we don&apos;t have memory problems, we don&apos;t need better brains.</p>
        <p>The convergence that we need is not about integrating with technology,<br>
          but combining the good parts of our cultures, so that the world can learn towards Peace.</p>
        <p>Without that shared wisdom, people are easily tricked to believe in conflict,<br>
          into the belief that there are borders, and across borders they must fight.</p>
        <p>By not helping each other to understand how special and unique we each are,<br>
          there grows a vocal minority of machine like minds, that think in mechanical terms.</p>
        <p>They add to get more, they take to be more,<br>
          they divide to make enemy, and subtract enemy to spread more.</p>
        <p>They think they are a cog, in a bigger machine,<br>
          but there is no machine, just that blind mind.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>It is OK to focus on just a few things so that we may grow, and grow in wisdom too,<br>
          but it is not OK to live in some narrow channel for simplicity sake.</p>
        <p>It actually isn&apos;t OK to do things to simplify,<br>
          complexity only moves in one direction.</p>
        <p>There is nothing healthy that can be done to un-mix a cup of tea,<br>
          there is nothing useful to be found in moving backwards in time.</p>
        <p>Complexity grows, and to make sense of growing complexity,<br>
          we cannot hope to simplify it, but rather adapt our minds to grasp it more efficiently.</p>
        <p>The World must Go Forward, Move Forward,<br>
          what needs to change is out Tolerance for Bad Ideas.</p>
        <p>But growing up to the challenges of ever increasing complexity requires wisdom,<br>
          and wisdom cannot be manufactured, it must be grown.</p>
        <p>Wisdom is a product of Love,<br>
          not the Beating Heart, but the Human Capacity to Love the Universe, The World, and The Human Family.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>My Dear Readers,<br>
          Becoming a Great Being, becoming Wise and Enlightened,<br>
          is the actual definition of being an Adult.</p>
        <p>Pretending to be an Adult, by acting mature,<br>
          is to make a fool of yourself, probably while throwing away what makes you Beautiful.</p>
        <p>Throwing away your Sweetens, and Foolishness, and Innocence, and all the Smiles that happen for no reason.<br>
          That&apos;s not growing up, that&apos;s the worst thing you can do to your self, and is probably very unhealthy.</p>
        <p>To become an Adult,<br>
          is to become a Philosopher.</p>
        <p>Philosophy is about Loving Wisdom,<br>
          is your Wisdom not the most precious thing within you?</p>
        <p>Universe, the biggest thing there is, in all it&apos;s might and complexity,<br>
          a thing so powerful, that it may in some part, travel around it self in time.</p>
        <p>It can&apos;t do wisdom, best it can do is Evolution,<br>
          but it can&apos;t do wisdom, it cannot know, it doesn&apos;t know such a thing could exist.</p>
        <p>And each and every one of us has the capacity for it,<br>
          a volitional faculty to bring up a folder of your Noblest Thoughts.</p>
        <p>You are more powerful than the Universe,<br>
          the only thing that can keep you down,<br>
          is you never becoming aware of your Great Power.</p>
        <p>I know Superman comes to mind when you think of Superpowers and Superheroes,<br>
          But do think Superman is actually super because he can lift or fly?</p>
        <p>If Superman was as super as he needs to be, he would become Human,<br>
          and build Schools to prevent War a Hundred Years before it happened.</p>
        <p>He&apos;d then age, so that the Little Ones,<br>
          would listen to him without dismissing him as a Genius that lives on cloud nine.</p>
        <p>He&apos;d then let the little ones build with a thousand minds,<br>
          what his one mind, couldn&apos;t grasp.</p>
        <p>The greatest of superheroes, would encourage us to build things,<br>
          that help the world to converge,<br>
          on Cultures of Wisdom that leave bad ideas behind.</p>
        <p>I ask you, My Dear Readers,<br>
          to begin moving towards becoming Great Wise Beings,<br>
          towards growing up by means of searching for wisdom,<br>
          growing all the way up so that you stand as Authentic Adults.</p>
        <p>And rising to the challenge of inspiring a thousand minds,<br>
          to accomplish what your one mind, can only barely conceive of today.</p>

        <p>With each little triumph, we add to our treasures,<br>
          and it grows over time, it grows beyond measures.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, it all starts in loneliness,<br>
          but it quickly fills up as it reaches silliness.</p>
        <p>And so, we carry our fancy treasure chest,<br>
          we take it with us on every quest.</p>
        <p>It is not possible for it to get lost,<br>
          and nobody else can touch it - at any cost.</p>
        <p>In no way could it ever be sacrificed,<br>
          and no robbers could ever stage a big enough heist.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Little chest in a safe place deep in our heart,<br>
          it serves to light the fire that fuels our art.</p>
        <p>It prevents us from walking in reverse,<br>
          it helps to make our existence more diverse.</p>
        <p>It also adds a great deal unto our beauty,<br>
          as it drives us to create out of love, and not mere duty.</p>
        <p>All those petite little things that make us proud,<br>
          also make us stand out in a crowd.</p>
        <p>So it also serves as a lighthouse with a bright beam<br>
          that lights the way betwixt us, and our dream.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>I think one reason why nobody ever mentions it,<br>
          is because it is too sacred, to just talk about it.</p>
        <p>But I want to remind you, my Dear Friends,<br>
          that sometimes we need to look through this lens.</p>
        <p>Your treasure chest will show you,<br>
          a picture of you that is most true.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Oh, don&apos;t worry if you have only one thing,<br>
          it is still a treasure, it still makes you a Queen or King.</p>
        <p>We all have a few simple treasures when we start,<br>
          but they grow as we use our heart to turn our life to art.</p>

            <small>May 18th 2020, 10:39:25 pm EDT</small>

        <p><a href="audio/poetry-0075.mp3" role="button" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="no-print">Listen</a></p>
        <p>Well, from the first moment on,<br>
          we are asked if we should live in harmony.</p>
        <p>We are still very young,<br>
          barely know of the world.</p>
        <p>And already the question of harmony comes,<br>
          and in harmony we learn, and thrive.</p>
        <p>Away from it, we&apos;ll be interrupted,<br>
          and feel lost in the void.</p>
        <p>It is a simple choice,<br>
          but out minds are not ready to make it.</p>
        <p>Often we forget.</p>
        <p>We forget about our little gardens,<br>
          and all the little walks.</p>
        <p>We forget how amazing it felt,<br>
          to stand on the wing of a plane.</p>
        <p>We forget the taste of popcorn at the Zoo,<br>
          or even how enormous Zoo felt.</p>
        <p>We forget pebbles at the river,<br>
          and mischievous squires at the park.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>That little dog with a bark,<br>
          that scaredy kitten always hiding in the dark.</p>
        <p>Our collection of unused keys,<br>
          and the box of bottle caps we collected with ease.</p>
        <p>We forgot our Lego and the old bike,<br>
          with that seat that we used to really like.</p>
        <p>We don&apos;t remember the Palaces and Castles,<br>
          that we used to love, and those swords, that fit us like a glove.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Everybody else came around,<br>
          acting like they know the ground.</p>
        <p>But, this was our gift from the Universe,<br>
          an affinity for flowering gardens, and little passage ways, and all those flying planes.</p>
        <p>It was a key to unlock our mind,<br>
          to understand the zoo, and our size in the universe, connect with pebbles at the beach.</p>
        <p>It is a pathway that fits us best,<br>
          to love little creatures, and collect some shineys, and build with blocks, and ride far and wide.</p>
        <p>It was to remind us,<br>
          to find our place among Great Beings, and study and pursue excellence, in all we do.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Then they sent us to First Grade,<br>
          and the weird kid peed into the Duplo, they didn&apos;t even have Lego.</p>
        <p>Then the teacher graded you down for counting pebles in your pocket,<br>
          and did it so many times, you lost track.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>There was a whisper about the pebbles,<br>
          it was Mr. Sagan - &quot;You are made of Star Stuff.&quot;</p>
        <p>And then the kids whispered...<br>
          to push you in the mud.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Push their laughter aside,<br>
          you&apos;ll need to Learn, and learn really hard.</p>
        <p>Cause right now, you&apos;re in the mud,<br>
          and you need to hang on.</p>
        <p>It will get worse,<br>
          but all you have to do is rise.</p>
        <p>Each time,<br>
          you&apos;ll rise higher.</p>
        <p>(When in trouble, call the Police it is OK for kids to call the Police, they&apos;ll love helping you, don&apos;t be scared.)</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Third Grade,<br>
          Fifth Grade.</p>
        <p>Low grade,<br>
          Uhh, but there can&apos;t be higher.</p>
        <p>Because by this time, you&apos;re getting bad grades,<br>
          because the teacher thinks you&apos;re copying from somewhere.</p>
        <p>The bullies know,<br>
          you did it on your own.</p>
        <p>Saw you pacing for days,<br>
          with your first program.</p>
        <p>Keep going forward,<br>
          don&apos;t let go - you&apos;re doing great, stay away from the hate.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>By the time you&apos;re out of Eight Grade,<br>
          by rejecting crazy, and nonsense, and stupid, and lazy, you graduate above all others.</p>
        <p>Because you didn&apos;t follow,<br>
          because you chose to study on your own, at your own pace.</p>
        <p>Because worthless grades meant nothing,<br>
          you felt no stress.</p>
        <p>Because, you didn&apos;t follow<br>
          nothing could hurt you.</p>
        <p>And your world is yours,<br>
          truly-truly yours.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>We unravel, when we forget who we are,<br>
          the moment we hide, or pretend, or follow.</p>
        <p>And, gosh darn it,<br>
          it happens when we are still kids.</p>
        <p>We are completely unprepared,<br>
          and none will help.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>So you! have to keep it together,<br>
          you can&apos;t let anyone hurt your mind.</p>
        <p>In High School, the pretenders make a sudden appearance,<br>
          never held a book in their hand.</p>
        <p>The back of Hamlet,<br>
          all the quotes have more IQ.</p>
        <p>Let the little Caesars,<br>
          keep the wind from the hall away.</p>
        <p>You need to pace your reading at the library,<br>
          teach yourself focus.</p>
        <p>Don&apos;t EVER! finish the books,<br>
          just get to the part that is valuable to you, and skip the rest.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Start working on your start-up early,<br>
          it is a study in failure.</p>
        <p>You need to create a series of CONTROLLED FAILURES,<br>
          this is very important.</p>
        <p>Learn <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=content+management">content management</a>,<br>
          and figure out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=stripe+wordpress">billing</a></p>
        <p>That&apos;s your surface platform,<br>
          and think about nature of business.</p>
        <p>Never try to build things directly,<br>
          facilitate the building of direct things for others.</p>
        <p>Help them setup,<br>
          so that you are not burdened, and keep going.</p>
        <p>Look at the structure of start-up accelerators, or even banks,<br>
          they take a percent, and never create what will weigh them down.</p>
        <p>Eventually, you can build your own Tesla,<br>
          but at first, you start with services.</p>
        <p>Look at the gym,<br>
          monthly subscription, is most stable.</p>
        <p>The lessons, are all around you.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>You don&apos;t need college,<br>
          but taking college classes is very relaxing.</p>
        <p>Make sure you get a 4.0 at each class,<br>
          be ready to repeat it.</p>
        <p>And enjoy,<br>
          the lectures.</p>
        <p>College is just a toy,<br>
          it looks bad on your Portfolio, so hide it.</p>
        <p>It is a very weak teaching experience,<br>
          and people know that there there is minimal learning involved.</p>
        <p>Jumping from high school to start-ups is more impressive,<br>
          and shows that you chose knowledge over nonsense.</p>
        <p>It shows that you chose to learn on your own,<br>
          to take care of your own mind,<br>
          rather than to pretend to learn for grades.</p>
        <p>Authenticity is very important in life,<br>
          it is hard to connect with people that role play.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Bonding with people that are just acting,<br>
          is only functional for as long as they are acting.</p>
        <p>But it is never good,<br>
          eventually they&apos;ll have a crisis, similar to a mid-life crisis.</p>
        <p>Stay Authentic,<br>
          keep to to those who are Authentic.</p>
        <p>Be safe.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>When it feels like everyone else is having an amazing life,<br>
          and you are stuck.</p>
        <p>Umm... that not true</p>
        <p>But it is also not healthy to think this way about yourself,<br>
          you are not beneath the party goers, they don&apos;t have what you have in your mind.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>But, that&apos;s far enough,<br>
          time to get some rest.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>This is where it gets interesting,<br>
          you have primed your mind for Business.</p>
        <p>That is a fine first step,<br>
          now you need to get ready for the real graduation.</p>
        <p>You need to section hike the equivalent of the Appalachian Trail,<br>
          and measure your jogging a hundred miles at a time.</p>
        <p>Section jogging, the Western States 100.</p>
        <p>Mind and Body, for the rest of your life.</p>
        <p>You must take good care of both.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>At mile fifty, halfway through a run,<br>
          as you piece together your blurry thoughts of your next business.</p>
        <p>Take some time to understand what it is that College Grads have,<br>
          those are very brittle relationships, and inflexible careers.</p>
        <p>We all feel the promise, but we can&apos;t fake it,<br>
          it would be the opposite, and certainly not worthy of you, my Friends.</p>
        <p>You can only find your meaning in Authenticity,<br>
          shortcuts will only take you back to the beginning.</p>
        <p>To live among the Extraordinary,<br>
          you must become Extraordinary yourself.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>The gateway to Meaning of Life,<br>
          is in that tiny moment when you think to your self:</p>
        <p>&quot;I am not going to jog tonight, I need rest.&quot;</p>
        <p>Right there in that dot,<br>
          is the keyhole,<br>
          to the key that you are,<br>
          to the gateway that you need to open.</p>
        <p>Life is not a simulation,<br>
          there are no days off,<br>
          life is quite a challenge,<br>
          and demands that each moment builds on the authenticity of the previous.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Open the dot, how can you yearn for Authenticity and Companionship,<br>
          and cancel, and fall short, and not enough, and rest some more.</p>
        <p>The gateway between Ordinary and Extraordinary,<br>
          is in accepting that we haven&apos;t got a choice to make.</p>
        <p>But shoes... to put on,<br>
          your Mind and Body must grow in harmony.</p>
        <p>You must not let go of the Harmony,<br>
          of your Magnificent Existence.</p>
        <p>Each small success, by subtle analogy,<br>
          pushes you forward, to your next step.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Eventually your tightly controlled business failures,<br>
          will fail, they will, fail to fail.</p>
        <p>Your mind too,<br>
          it won&apos;t perceive the easy choice as an option.</p>
        <p>All- will proceed,<br>
          in harmony.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Labored breathing,<br>
          by the Pine Trees at Western States,</p>
        <p>Another great step in Automation of your business,<br>
          and more investors.</p>
        <p>And you&apos;re no longer stopping at the first thing you find in books,<br>
          you understand all of it.</p>
        <p>What is made by humans,<br>
          is also All Too Human.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>And the Bullies are Gone,<br>
          and Eight Grade still sucks.</p>
        <p>High school ... influences,<br>
          are trying to figure out where they went wrong - good luck!</p>
        <p>College, is still a very romantic idea,<br>
          but it is best left to imagination.</p>
        <p>Your dreams are so much more now,<br>
          only what you create can live up to them.</p>
        <p>You are a Leader,<br>
          full of might an joy.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>And now you know,<br>
          shortcuts only lead people to their beginnings.</p>
        <p>And the one road, the only road,<br>
          was the one of Authenticity, and Achievement.</p>
        <p>Where we learned for real, not for grades,<br>
          where what we learned added up to create wisdom, and not a stupid GPA.</p>
        <p>You&apos;ll be OK, so as long as you Learn onward and become Wise,<br>
          and Live in Authentic Harmony with Yourself.</p>
        <p>This is how you become an Adult,<br>
          that was the one thing that all others were missing.</p>
        <p>It&apos;s what made them pretend and simulate,<br>
          but, growing up can&apos;t be faked.</p>
        <p>Growing up has to be written by the choices you make,<br>
          on the surface, that is your lifetime.</p>
        <p>The dreams you always dream, will come true,<br>
          but not in your childhood, childhood is for learning.</p>
        <p>Live in Harmony with yourself,<br>
          and live in harmony with the Universe.</p>
        <p>Growing up is really special,<br>
          it is really important for our health.</p>
        <p>It is a deeply internal process,<br>
          and there are no shortcuts to growing up.</p>
        <p>It is meant to be,<br>
          Beautiful.</p>

        <p>It was a very rainy day,<br>
          the sky was completely gray.</p>
        <p>I took a nap come afternoon,<br>
          fell into my bed with a big swoon.</p>
        <p>I woke up rested, and ran to the door,<br>
          but it only seemed to rain more.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>I resumed my endurance training a week back,<br>
          It was a warm-up week, so I ran like a Mac truck.</p>
        <p>I actually sprinted yesterday,<br>
          somewhat frightening myself along the way.</p>
        <p>I felt like I was all muscle,<br>
          I moved like red lightening, without a hustle.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Even though yesterday I ran in the rain,<br>
          I rained only a bit, so I had to train.</p>
        <p>Today, the rain seemed like too much trouble,<br>
          I rested, but tomorrow I&apos;ll have to train double.</p>
        <p>I always tell people not to rest,<br>
          let Mother Mature decide, she knows best.</p>

        <p>We often think of consequences to mistakes,<br>
          but consequence does not pick.</p>
        <p>So as long as we keep to our paths,<br>
          all our actions cast changes ahead.</p>
        <p>In mistakes, lessons await,<br>
          in good deeds, we find family.</p>
        <p>In great adventure, we&apos;ll find mountains,<br>
          in great achievements, calm and peace.</p>
        <p>In darkness, we will find light,<br>
          in isolation, we&apos;ll find hugs.</p>
        <p>So as long as we keep to our paths.<br>
          what we shall find will make us stronger.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>However, if we dare so to diverge,<br>
          all we have cast we&apos;ll be lost.</p>
        <p>Perhaps no shadows, but certainly no light,<br>
          no lessons, no sweetness, no might.</p>
        <p>By switching paths we&apos;ll find fewer wisdoms,<br>
          and far more things that don&apos;t fit us.</p>
        <p>We&apos;ll also find a force of opposition,<br>
          it will keep our minds tired.</p>
        <p>It will be unclear why life seems strange,<br>
          why everything takes so much more to see.</p>
        <p>Why we seem to lack confidence,<br>
          or how everyone else has so much of it.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>But, the most troubling thing, my Dear Friends,<br>
          is in how easy it is to diverge.</p>
        <p>There is a place for Leaps of Faith in life,<br>
          they are quite sacred, and as beautiful.</p>
        <p>But, to fill in a stranger&apos;s blanks,<br>
          or trust that the others know what they are doing.</p>
        <p>To listen to good advice that considers you naught,<br>
          or give something up of your self, and not know why.</p>
        <p>To go to a place because everyone went there,<br>
          to bow because all others bowed.</p>
        <p>That is not sacred, sacrilegious maybe,<br>
          you must never follow, you must always lead.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Even more troubling is how it all collapses,<br>
          not with a bang, but a stupid sick whimper:</p>
        <p>&quot;How were they supposed to know&quot;,<br>
          &quot;How was I supposed to know?&quot;</p>
        <p>All the blame for what others did,<br>
          to Your Sacred Self, somehow falls back right on you.</p>
        <p>And then it turns out,<br>
          your lesson is all over cheap paperbacks.</p>
        <p>Everyone has been trough this,<br>
          and none were the wiser.</p>
        <p>All those confident faces and smiles, were faked,<br>
          and the more convincing they try to be, the less they are in pain.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>When someone is putting you at risk,<br>
          take a split second to imagine them saying:</p>
        <p>&quot;How was I supposed to know?&quot;, and stand your ground.<br>
          You are not to follow, you are to lead.</p>
        <p>Let them have have their stupid games, and drinks, temporary junk,<br>
          you go to the DIA, take some notes, and splurge on clay.</p>
        <p>Find a gallery worthy of your works,<br>
          resume where Rodin left off.</p>
        <p>Instead of filling the blanks,<br>
          show the world the shapes.</p>
        <p>How can your other half recognize you,<br>
          when you are traveling on some other path.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>What you many not do, is to start at the bottom,<br>
          all those cheap novels, they describe starting at the zero.</p>
        <p>Start where all the heroes left off,<br>
          read a handful of novels, and move on to their Memoirs.</p>
        <p>Your life depends on knowing what it is and where to start,<br>
          and what to avoid.</p>
        <p>It will get lonely, yes.<br>
          You&apos;ll be lonely because you don&apos;t drink, and don&apos;t do stupid things.</p>
        <p>You&apos;ll be lonely, but, You&apos;ll be You,<br>
          you will shine your own light, and. you. will. be. seen.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Get up, step up,<br>
          create and speak with art, and you&apos;ll talk with the world.</p>
        <p>Grab pencils, trace with an Office Projector,<br>
          and bring your Tortillon along.</p>
        <p>At the gym, dance,<br>
          your way is the only way.</p>
        <p>You may get lonely,<br>
          but for long.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Try to help people learn, what you have learned,<br>
          become an assistant, a tutor, and a substitute teacher.</p>
        <p>Keep track of your Peace Corps application,<br>
          just keep adding to it, keep re-sending it.</p>
        <p>They probably don&apos;t read it until version 50, anyway.<br>
          It gives you time to revise and refine the ideas.</p>
        <p>To begin walking your own path,<br>
          is to enter, The Grand Path of Pursuits of Excellence.</p>
        <p>Everything on your own path will add to you,<br>
          there will be no limit to how far you can travel.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Stay on your own path, avoid generic advice, read Memoirs,<br>
          keep moving up, and always try to move faster.</p>
        <p>Learn about new things,<br>
          expand your knowledge, every day.</p>
        <p>If it is something you don&apos;t understand,<br>
          find an Audiobook about it.</p>
        <p>Stay sharp, stay fit,<br>
          endurance training goes well with Audiobooks, and Love of Wisdom.</p>
        <p>Others must have no influence on you,<br>
          this is not their life, it is your life.</p>
        <p>Move at your own pace, and in your own sequence,<br>
          make your 90 old self laugh, at how amazing you are.</p>
