        <p>Philosophy, and her Daughters the Sciences, are a way to put ourselves to words,<br>
          they are a means of storage, transfer, and communication.</p>
        <p>Philosophy is a thin outer layer of the Human Mind,<br>
          of the Human Condition, of the Raw, Unleashed, Human Consciousness.</p>
        <p>Within, Rises The Human,<br>
          The Source of Raw.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>The only flaw,<br>
          is us becoming convinced we are small.</p>
        <p>That&apos;s why we have each other,<br>
          I remind you, you remind your granddaughter, she reminds those in need.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>And the Triumph continues,<br>
          The Triumph, is an unbroken line through the past.</p>
        <p>Like an eraser it runs over nations that take freedom,<br>
          wiping out corrupt politicians for the specks of dust they are.</p>
        <p>It a bone shaking scream it runs through the blind judge,<br>
          it strikes nightmares in those who treat men as animal.</p>
        <p>It pierces the hearts of animals that recruit unprepared kids to teach them how to become &quot;men&quot; in war,<br>
          it carves, the predatory weapon manufactures that turned air to acid for a profit.</p>
        <p>It strikes right through the slavers burning them to dust,<br>
          the lawless beg in their last moments as the village heroes rise.</p>
        <p>And the wolves run and hide under our very own blankets,<br>
          made of the snarling bear skins from last week.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>History of the Human Kind,<br>
          will always be writ and washed by prevalent powers.</p>
        <p>But that will always be a surface story,<br>
          because in the face of the future the truth is always revealed.</p>
        <p>You are easily capable of becoming countless times more,<br>
          than the heroes described in the books.</p>
        <p>By subtle analogy to whatever our triumphs are,<br>
          we can see all the other triumphs for what they really were.</p>
        <p>By the very power that expands our wisdom,<br>
          we grow to no end.</p>
