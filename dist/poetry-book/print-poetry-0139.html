        <p>Nope, we may not finish school, get a job, buy a house, and worry about old age;<br>
          My Dear fiends, I forbid you, and you&apos;re not even not allowed anyway.</p>
        <p>I don&apos;t know who came up with thins nonsense,<br>
          and I don&apos;t know why our parents repeat it - though I have some theories.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>You are to figure out what moves you,<br>
          and get on with it.</p>
        <p>What moves you,<br>
          is also what helps you grow.</p>
        <p>What moves you,<br>
          will make you extremely strong and beautiful.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>And it may very well be that it is some kind of a career,<br>
          but there will certainly be something better.</p>
        <p>Becoming a professional,<br>
          and spending the rest of your life as that professional - are very different things.</p>
        <p>In deed.</p>
        <p>And what is more, my Dear Fiends,<br>
          is that you will be making that initial choice under the influence;<br>
          of being too young to actually make decisions of that magnitude.</p>
        <p>You will surely be beautiful and powerful enough to make it,<br>
          but when you enter your early Mighty Middle Age,<br>
          you will be even more Beautiful and even more Capable.</p>
        <p>What seemed like a Delicious Challenge in your youth,<br>
          will no longer challenge you enough.</p>
        <p>I am sorry.</p>
        <p>But something as simple as a fine direction chosen in early life,<br>
          will soon be no longer be enough to do you justice.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Life is living.</p>
        <p>It will never be as simple as quitting gym,<br>
          and saying &quot;I can&apos;t... I have a job now.&quot;.</p>
        <p>Nope.</p>
        <p>Nuh uh.</p>
        <p>Now, you need to quit your job,<br>
          and start catching up, surpass what you once were, and now build on top of that.</p>
        <p>Your undertakings are,<br>
          are not to subtract from you.</p>
        <p>Our lives come with a limit,<br>
          it is a terrible tragedy, and I am very sorry.</p>
        <p>But it also makes it that much more important,<br>
          that we grow, that we flourish, that we bloom.</p>
        <p>That every new day of our life,<br>
          adds to the previous.</p>
        <p>When all our pursuits are connected meaningfully together in authenticity,<br>
          they become an enormous treasure, and a song of ourselves.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Life may look simple from the first step before we start growing up.</p>
        <p>But it becomes clear that it is more important to live an Inspired Existence that Adds Unto Us,<br>
          at the very least, because of how much we grow, and how much more we become the best of ourselves.</p>
        <p>Life is so dear,<br>
          it is not a very good idea to follow what someone else expects of us.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>You are always growing in complexity,<br>
          and the universe around you will unfold as more complex too.</p>
        <p>For example, we don&apos;t get old,<br>
          we grow, we expand, eventually gaining the ability to speak about our experience; and inspire and move crowds.</p>
        <p>Growing old is what a brainless fruit does,<br>
          we are Philosophers, Poets, Artists,<br>
          we are always growing, renewing, living, we don&apos;t lose anything - we gain.</p>
