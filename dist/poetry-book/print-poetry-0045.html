        <p>Everything is all right, except for our flight.<br>
          But had we been given infinite light,<br>
          our wings would fail in flight.</p>
        <p>What gives us the right to learn, and rise to height,<br>
          is the limit of the duration of our light.</p>
        <p>What makes it precious, and worth the flight,<br>
          is precisely the limits in duration of our light.</p>
        <p>It is by our limits that we look to light,<br>
          had we been given infinite flight,<br>
          our intelligence would fail to light.</p>
