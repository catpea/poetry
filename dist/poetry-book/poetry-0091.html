        <p>Your light must be a true reflection of Yourself,<br>
          so that You may be truly seen and understood.</p>
        <p>Do not hide, emulate, simulate, pretend, or serve;<br>
          that only disrupts Your light and path.</p>
        <p>You are already special enough,<br>
          You are a Child of The Universe.</p>
        <p>You are meant to become a Great Being through your own journey,<br>
          You are meant to bring enlightenment, unseen before.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Please, take good care of Yourself,<br>
          You are responsible for Your delicate mind and body.</p>
        <p>And take care of Your Elder Self,<br>
          so that You may have no regrets come Your Golden Age.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Your Existence, requires that You walk Your own path,<br>
          that You lead Your own way.</p>
        <p>But the path is not a straight line,<br>
          it is more of a flat spiral, you are never far from yourself.</p>
        <p>There is so much of You in Your Elder Self,<br>
          and there is so much of Your Elder self in You already.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Be good to Her, love Yourself,<br>
          be mighty, and authentic.</p>
        <p>Never let Yourself down, always rise,<br>
          and do not slow down.</p>
        <p>Step after step jog mightily forward,<br>
          decorate Your Beautiful Journey with Wisdom and Triumph.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>May Your elder self, perch upon a porch,<br>
          and muse and wonder...</p>
        <p>&quot;What a strange Star Child I was,<br>
          and how impossibly long my Beautiful Life&quot;</p>
        <p>And may You bring Her memories,<br>
          of every year in each decade.</p>
        <p>Of things You noticed for the first time,<br>
          and things You never knew could happen.</p>
        <p>And things, that other people never expected of You,<br>
          like that year, that you wore a bushy tail - because it made you feel beautiful.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Love Your older self,<br>
          make Her smile and wonder.</p>
        <p>Make Her love the Younger You,<br>
          but fill in all the years completely.</p>
        <p>Make sure, that not only is there nothing new to add,<br>
          but also that there is nowhere anything could fit.</p>
