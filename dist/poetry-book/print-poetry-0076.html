        <p>With each little triumph, we add to our treasures,<br>
          and it grows over time, it grows beyond measures.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, it all starts in loneliness,<br>
          but it quickly fills up as it reaches silliness.</p>
        <p>And so, we carry our fancy treasure chest,<br>
          we take it with us on every quest.</p>
        <p>It is not possible for it to get lost,<br>
          and nobody else can touch it - at any cost.</p>
        <p>In no way could it ever be sacrificed,<br>
          and no robbers could ever stage a big enough heist.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Little chest in a safe place deep in our heart,<br>
          it serves to light the fire that fuels our art.</p>
        <p>It prevents us from walking in reverse,<br>
          it helps to make our existence more diverse.</p>
        <p>It also adds a great deal unto our beauty,<br>
          as it drives us to create out of love, and not mere duty.</p>
        <p>All those petite little things that make us proud,<br>
          also make us stand out in a crowd.</p>
        <p>So it also serves as a lighthouse with a bright beam<br>
          that lights the way betwixt us, and our dream.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>I think one reason why nobody ever mentions it,<br>
          is because it is too sacred, to just talk about it.</p>
        <p>But I want to remind you, my Dear Friends,<br>
          that sometimes we need to look through this lens.</p>
        <p>Your treasure chest will show you,<br>
          a picture of you that is most true.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Oh, don&apos;t worry if you have only one thing,<br>
          it is still a treasure, it still makes you a Queen or King.</p>
        <p>We all have a few simple treasures when we start,<br>
          but they grow as we use our heart to turn our life to art.</p>
