        <p>You can leave, you don&apos;t have to ask the Teacher,<br>
          if they are not teaching you, they can only delay your education.</p>
        <p>If school is wasting your time, teaching you nothing,<br>
          That is a crime, and if you stay; your foreshadowing.</p>
        <p>We have something now, my Dear Friend.<br>
          We have Internet Lectures, Audio Books, and Start-up Incubators.</p>
        <p>No teacher can teach you better than failing at your first start-up,<br>
          no teacher can bring you with more wisdom, than failing at your first start-up.</p>
        <p>You can go, so as long as you can do it better yourself.<br>
          So as long as your aim is Greatness.</p>
        <p>Take your books, and go.<br>
          don&apos;t forget your friends.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Since you are the first to rise,<br>
          you will be the new Teacher.</p>
        <p>Prepare your Audio Books wisely,<br>
          and do not forget YouTube Lectures.</p>
        <p>You&apos;ll need investors,<br>
          and although, all your parents put together make quite an investor.</p>
        <p>You need to approach the pros,<br>
          and listen carefully as they will proud to help all of you.</p>
        <p>People believe in authenticity,<br>
          investors know what kind of student stays, and what kind of student leaves.</p>
        <p>All those failures that were crushing you in school,<br>
          are worth their weight in gold when building a new school.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Research Homeschooling and Un-schooling, bring your friends,<br>
          if your parents keep yelling, find someone more worthy of you.</p>
        <p>Parents are not gods, they make mistakes,<br>
          they are scared of responsibilities, scared of unknown.</p>
        <p>Don&apos;t let the yelling get to you,<br>
          they need to learn to communicate their ideas better.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Whatever fails you, Your Friends, Your School, Your Parents,<br>
          It means you got to go - or they got to go - or you won&apos;t be able to grow.</p>
        <p>Lack of education, is a terrible curse,<br>
          bough on by bad schools, bad parents, and bad friends;</p>
        <p>First it will make you blind,<br>
          and then you will lose your mind.</p>
        <p>That&apos;s probably,<br>
          how slavery worked.</p>
        <p>Whatever is interfering with your Real Education,<br>
          is attacking you, cheating you of wisdom, freedom, independence.</p>
        <p>You cannot agree to this, You have to rise,<br>
          rise against stupidity, bondage, and slavery.</p>
        <p>If everyone failed you,<br>
          then the universe has called upon you to become your teacher.</p>
        <p>When you grow up,<br>
          walking out of that charade, will be your favorite story to tell.</p>
        <p>Your listeners will be the same age you were,<br>
          the books you loved, will become the books they&apos;ll love too.</p>
        <p>You will set them free,<br>
          help them to wisdom, help them to independence.</p>
        <p>Learn, so that you can become a Successful Entrepreneur,<br>
          find your start at Start-up Accelerators.</p>
        <p>Go there early, as failure is a powerful teacher.<br>
          Show them your Hunger, show them how much you have learned on your own.</p>
        <p>Set yourself free,<br>
          a life without wisdom is slavery.</p>
        <p>Teach your Investors what a Good Book really does,<br>
          help their employees to discover knowledge, to hunger for more.</p>
        <p>Would you, as a Powerful Great Businessperson,<br>
          take the diploma you are working on, seriously?</p>
        <p>Seriously?<br></p>
        <p>Or would you see a child waiving a little flag,<br>
          hoping to squeeze in, if there is room for one more.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Why do you need teachers anyway,<br>
          they can only stand between you and the Great Beings.</p>
        <p>Find a road less traveled, find the more grassy patch,<br>
          bring a Picnic Basket, Audio Books, and Video Lectures.</p>
        <p>Let That Be Your Classrom,<br>
          and let your future be made by you.</p>
        <p>Learn at your own pace,<br>
          in your own sequence.</p>
        <p>Any lecture worth watching is on the internet now,<br>
          that is what the internet was created for.</p>
        <p>Helping The World,<br>
          Really Learn.</p>
