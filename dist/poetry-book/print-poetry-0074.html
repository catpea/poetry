        <p>It was a very rainy day,<br>
          the sky was completely gray.</p>
        <p>I took a nap come afternoon,<br>
          fell into my bed with a big swoon.</p>
        <p>I woke up rested, and ran to the door,<br>
          but it only seemed to rain more.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>I resumed my endurance training a week back,<br>
          It was a warm-up week, so I ran like a Mac truck.</p>
        <p>I actually sprinted yesterday,<br>
          somewhat frightening myself along the way.</p>
        <p>I felt like I was all muscle,<br>
          I moved like red lightening, without a hustle.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Even though yesterday I ran in the rain,<br>
          I rained only a bit, so I had to train.</p>
        <p>Today, the rain seemed like too much trouble,<br>
          I rested, but tomorrow I&apos;ll have to train double.</p>
        <p>I always tell people not to rest,<br>
          let Mother Mature decide, she knows best.</p>
