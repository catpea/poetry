        <p>Captain&apos;s Log: Quarantine.</p>
        <p>Day Twenty One.</p>
        <p>There is birdsong outside, and I can feel the sun.</p>
        <p>I woke up rested, for the first time, in years.</p>
        <p>My mind was hardly ever tired, but all the rest needed time.</p>
        <p>I am ready for gyms to reopen, It will be so much fun.</p>
        <p>I will dance even faster, workout longer.</p>
        <p>My diet is twice as good as it was before,</p>
        <p>including soup, and proper portion control.</p>
        <p>It took twenty one days,</p>
        <p>for my body to begin recovering from my workouts.</p>
        <p>What a great sadness it would be, to wish now,</p>
        <p>that I should have danced, or tried harder.</p>
        <p>Instead, here I am. Bouncy, and perky as heck,</p>
        <p>Ready to go back.</p>
        <p>Use your days wisely,</p>
        <p>let no day slip away.</p>
        <p>Live, make each day count,</p>
        <p>it all adds together, balance your account.</p>
        <p>What makes us great,</p>
        <p>is the sum of all the days in the past.</p>
        <p>What makes us strong,</p>
        <p>is making each day better than the one before.</p>
        <p>Make each day count,</p>
        <p>enlarge your world.</p>
