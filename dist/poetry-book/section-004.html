        <p>Captain&apos;s Log, Quarantine, Day Thirty Nine,<br>
          A vegetable juice out of line.</p>
        <p>The Tomato with Sprinkles was born of accident,<br>
          when making my salad, this is how it went;</p>
        <p>The salad bag tore,<br>
          and some of the salad went on the floor.</p>
        <p>But a fistful, fell in my tomato juice,<br>
          and decorated it with sprinkles of produce.</p>
        <p>It is hard to recommend, but I must say,<br>
          it tasted great, and I&apos;ll drink it everyday.</p>

        <p>Captain&apos;s Log, Quarantine, Day Thirty Eight,<br>
          My salads are working great!</p>
        <p>I have lost even more weight,<br>
          and I can&apos;t even count how many I ate.</p>
        <p>It is a marvelous diet of incredible proportions,<br>
          I don&apos;t track my calories, or even my portions.</p>
        <p>I just make a salad once or twice,<br>
          and with strawberry jam, it tastes like paradise.</p>
        <p>And yes, I still continue improving and experimenting,<br>
          Today, I added Jalapenos for a little spicy augmenting.</p>
        <p>It is a strange magical thing,<br>
          but Sugary Jam and Jalapenos are king.</p>
        <p>It is not all sugar and spice, as yesterday I cried,<br>
          I added and ate an whole onion so angry, I almost died.</p>
        <p>So it is not just strawberry jam anymore,<br>
          blueberry works just as well, maybe even more.</p>
        <p>To all the diet people out there,<br>
          join me in my venture,<br>
          add a spoon jam,<br>
          and taste the adventure.</p>

        <p>Captain&apos;s Log, Quarantine, Day Thirty Seven.<br>
          I can&apos;t believe that seven only rhymes with Eleven, and Heaven.</p>
        <p>Every ten days I get stuck rhyming those two words,<br>
          and it is just about as fun as petting birds.</p>
        <p>I was writing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hz7-v2f1sA">Bash</a> this afternoon,<br>
          I am so full of energy, I feel like a loon.</p>
        <p>I was so tired at eight yesterday,<br>
          I have no idea how I will fall asleep today.</p>
        <p>I wrote a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW4CdejMNPA">non-capturing</a> Perl <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykSuHWhh5hc">Regular Expression</a> in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32waL1Z9XK0">sed</a>,<br>
          gosh I miss the old <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2JJZVqe97I">Perl</a>, I miss <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zx1vEmaQMc">CGI</a>, and I miss <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNYpmLH6IjQ">ed</a>.</p>
        <p>What has the world become after <a href="https://youtu.be/PUv66718DII?t=2490">abandoning modes</a>,<br>
          and how strange have become our codes.</p>
        <p>Using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=St5B7hnMLjg">SASS</a> writ in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJkB_Tggk8U">C++</a>,<br>
          to make <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT0Lh1eYk78">CSS</a>? What a mess!</p>
        <p>And beyond that, with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoRJizFvM7s">async/await</a>,<br>
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9A_jkh2AKR8">JavaScript</a> has become a heavy weight.</p>
        <p>I always tell people if you make for the web,<br>
          use the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGvA92h9IbU">language, of the web</a>.</p>
        <p>They then look at me accusingly,<br>
          parading <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Tko2YC5hA">Python</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBL9Athx7ms">PHP</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KlnlCq2M5Q">Dart</a>, maybe <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Xa3Y4xz8_s">Java</a>?! amusingly.</p>
        <p>Come on people, this is not our first rodeo,<br>
          Time took out Perl with a torpedo.</p>
        <p>This is war, and those who fall behind lose,<br>
          If you write for the web, use the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGvA92h9IbU">language, of the web</a>.</p>
        <p>Your utilities will hang around longer,<br>

        <p>Captain&apos;s Log, Quarantine, Day Thirty Five.</p>
        <p>I am not sure that the end of quarantine will ever arrive,<br>
          so I am preparing to write enough poetry to fill a hard drive.</p>
        <p>I think I shall begin writing about cats,<br>
          and then complain a bit about bureaucrats.</p>
        <p>When I am done complaining,<br>
          I shall pick something more entertaining.</p>
        <p>Like perhaps musing about Lowbrow Art,<br>
          and then carry on babbling about someone smart.</p>
        <p>Maybe a Scientist, or a Philosopher like Descartes,<br>
          or maybe a colorful leader like Napoleon Bonaparte.</p>
        <p>Then, when, I&apos;ll run out of things to babble on,<br>
          I will jump on my bicycle and set off at dawn,</p>
        <p>I&apos;ll bring my notepad and a pen,<br>
          and come up with a new idea,<br>
          every now and then.</p>

        <p>Captain&apos;s Log, Quarantine, Day Thirty Four.</p>
        <p>I finished a big program, but I am ready for more.</p>
        <p>So, I am writing a poem, and its always very hard,<br>
          because I never know what its going to be about.</p>
        <p>One moment, I am mighty, serious, and athletic,<br>
          then I sit to the poem, and I lose that aesthetic.</p>
        <p>In my early 20s I wore a Blues Brother suit for office work,<br>
          but even that didn&apos;t work, cause I added cowboy-shoes,<br>
          and a huge buckle, not a day past when I didn&apos;t get a chuckle.</p>
        <p>Later it got even worse, I wore leather pants and a Matrix coat,<br>
          I fit into my coffee shop like a mountain goat.</p>
        <p>Being serious is just too darn hard,<br>
          I don&apos;t have the might,</p>
        <p>OK, that&apos;s enough for this poetic flight,<br>
          I am done writing, y&apos;all have goodnight.</p>

        <p>Captain&apos;s Log, Quarantine, Day Thirty Three.</p>
        <p>Days pass by quickly, but as all the clocks tick away,<br>
          we mustn&apos;t keep our minds at bay.</p>
        <p>We each have extraordinary powers,<br>
          and we can expand our knowledge,<br>
          in just a few hours.</p>
        <p>All it takes is a video lecture,<br>
          or maybe an audio-book,<br>
          you don&apos;t even have to look.</p>
        <p>Hours add up, day by day,<br>
          building, a new passageway.<br>
          It is knowledge that sets us free.</p>
        <p>And our inheritance from great beings,<br>
          is the key.</p>
        <p>We mustn&apos;t forget, that everyone needs to learn,<br>
          not merely listen, but break out of their prison,<br>
          and rise to greatness, when theirs is the turn.</p>
        <p>It is within us, that each great being should return,<br>
          it is how the world grows, it is how you get your turn.</p>
        <p>So, rise to their height, inherit their might,<br>
          shine the brightest of light,<br>
          yours is the future, yours is the fight.</p>
