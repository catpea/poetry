        <p>I sprayed myself with sunscreen today,<br>
          grabbed my bicycle, and went on my way.</p>
        <p>And then,<br>
          all of a sudden!</p>
        <p>I thought I was attacked by some angry bees,<br>
          it turned out to be a mosquito who got me twice, in both knees.</p>
        <p>To be fair, I wore my new short pants to be trendy,<br>
          but the little sucker didn&apos;t need to get me where I am so bendy.</p>
        <p>It itched all the way back home with each turn of the bicycle wheel,<br>
          ... it was indeed a very itchy ordeal.</p>
        <p>When I finally got home, I took a vitamin,<br>
          and on each knee; I squirted a bit of anti-histamine.</p>
        <p>I sat there a bit, wondering &quot;Why me?&quot;<br>
          &quot;Why get me twice in each knee?&quot;</p>
        <p>To be honest, until I realized that&apos;s simply where my new pants ended,<br>
          I was feeling pretty gosh darn offended.</p>

        <p>No one regrets becoming wise,<br>
          no adult ever wished to stay a child.</p>
        <p>All the grownups,<br>
          embrace the powers they developed.</p>
        <p>You can see it in the way<br>
          they Nobly &amp; Calmly carry themselves.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>The time meant for your growing up,<br>
          should not be disrupted in any way.</p>
        <p>Growing up,<br>
          is not as random as it seems.</p>
        <p>Your own observations,<br>
          will create questions.</p>
        <p>Questions will sprout affinities,<br>
          and affinities will draw you towards places with answers.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Growing up, begins with simple questions, and simple answers,<br>
          but we amass a library of twisty little passages.</p>
        <p>Later in life,<br>
          we apply those passages other things.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>We face the Universe,<br>
          and there are consequences to all our actions.</p>
        <p>What do we do when the bullies come?<br>
          We learn to practice restraint, so that we don&apos;t end up the snarling beasts they are.</p>
        <p>What do we do, when people belittle us, step on us?<br>
          We expand our own sense of Dignity, and Nobility into an Independent Universe free of their flaws and limitations.</p>
        <p>And how do we stand up against Isolation, or being Cast Away?<br>
          With Unbreakability, Fortitude, Courage and Honor.</p>
        <p>The meaning of life?<br>
          The meaning of life is always found in Love.</p>
        <p>And how do we learn to see and rise and better ourselves?<br>
          With Insight; and Foresight; and Understanding; and Authenticity; and Heroism;</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>My Dear Friends,</p>
        <p>Your growing up,<br>
          is the very Formation of you.</p>
        <p>This is not a process that anyone is allowed to interrupt,<br>
          you are not allowed to have anybody step in your way.</p>
        <p>It is like learning to walk,<br>
          no one is allowed to push you to the ground.</p>
        <p>I don&apos;t know if there is anything more sacred,<br>
          than your growing up.</p>
        <p>You must learn to push what is not important away,<br>
          you must get comfortable with not following.</p>
        <p>And you must stand your ground, or walk your path...<br>
          You must, lead.</p>
        <p>You must make sure that you rise a little higher each and every day,<br>
          and that each day adds to the previous.</p>
        <p>Growing Up Is Sacred,<br>
          It Is Your Right.</p>

        <p>Where do we come from, and why are we here,<br>
          are just silly questions.</p>
        <p>While even silly questions lead to good things,<br>
          they&apos;re not the primary questions we need to answer - like what makes us unique, and what do we love, and where are going to go, and what great mountains must we face.</p>
        <p>We are here because there was no one to count the failed attempts,<br>
          because the universe was running out of other paths.</p>
        <p>There was no plan,<br>
          there was just a progression forward.</p>
        <p>Universally speaking, there is probably plenty of life out there,<br>
          but what the Universe will never have, cannot build, is another You.</p>
        <p>If someone tried to take your place,
          it could never work, ever, at all.</p>
        <p>In All This Complexity,<br>
          You Are One And Only.</p>
        <p>There will never be another you,<br>
          ever.</p>
        <p>It is because at a certain point, the Universe stops, and your ideas take over,<br>
          you become the creator, you become a Youniverse within a Universe.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>You are plenty special, but if you only move forward,<br>
          you will not gain the capacity to fully share who you are.</p>
        <p>The universe will know, that you are Majestic, and Adventurous,<br>
          and sometimes, Mischievous. But we need more of you!</p>
        <p>We need Your Sculptures!<br>
          We need Your Poetry!<br>
          We Need Your Works,</p>
        <p>So that we may learn,<br>
          and maybe continue your work.</p>
        <p>We Have Questions,</p>
        <p>And you are the only one with your answers,<br>
          so grow up already, build up, create and share your wisdom.</p>
        <p>The Wisdom you will gain from your Pursuits of Excellence,<br>
          will be unlike anything else the Universe has ever seen before.</p>
        <p>You will speak in your own pictures, with your personal touch,<br>
          and the words you love, and above all the Paths You Took.</p>
        <p>With Your Help and Works,</p>
        <p>Humanity will become Wiser,<br>
          and more beautiful.</p>
        <p>Help Us See.</p>

        <p>Don&apos;t just move forward,<br>
          you have to move up!</p>
        <p>Life is too short,<br>
          You are too Noble,<br>
          Truth is too Dear.</p>
        <p>Many give away their Time,<br>
          some even give away Trust.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, because they are tired,<br>
          because they had enough,<br>
          or had waited long enough.</p>
        <p>Giving something of yourself away,<br>
          will not make that other person Nobler.</p>
        <p>And you are not supposed to wait,<br>
          in waiting all your life will pass you by.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>You are supposed to learn,<br>
          you are supposed to move,<br>
          you are supposed to shine.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>You will lose your mind if you do noting,<br>
          and You will lose your self, unless you grow up.</p>
        <p>You&apos;ll never lose the ability to turn around,<br>
          and try again, it maybe harder if you wait too long...</p>
        <p>... but in your waiting,<br>
          you&apos;ll become tougher too.</p>
        <p>No, there is no point of no return,<br>
          but all those who rise, would agree:</p>
        <p>&quot;Do it sooner than later&quot;.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Begin, by taking back what you have given away,<br>
          and permanently and meaningfully so, and rise up.</p>
        <p>There is no art to this,<br>
          you just pick yourself up, and go.</p>
        <p>You&apos;re going to need running shoes,<br>
          and your first battle will be with Fatigue.</p>
        <p>Be good to yourself,<br>
          strive to be better,<br>
          let your body rest enough so it may grow stronger.</p>
        <p>And return to point Zero,<br>
          go all the way back.</p>
        <p>Of all the noble things within You,<br>
          not a single thing is to be shared unearned.</p>
        <p>And listen carefully, to the words spoken to you,<br>
          by inference re-construct that which drives others.</p>
        <p>And find the Kindred, and the Kin,<br>
          do not be alone for too long.</p>
        <p>Isolation is as bad as Fatigue,<br>
          it is a state of having fallen, and being lost.</p>
        <p>You are To Thrive,<br>
          You are To Grow.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Keep searching, keep training,<br>
          stay away from hate, and those who fell behind on growing up.</p>
        <p>Keep learning,<br>
          keep moving,<br>
          let yourself shine.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Nothing important in life is found at the foothills,<br>
          you have to get to the mountains, and carry on climbing.</p>
        <p>Do not stop,<br>
          and keep moving up.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>As to what it is all for,<br>
          it is to better yourself.</p>
        <p>To rise above yourself to new thoughts,<br>
          and powers, and insights, and observations.</p>
        <p>If you stay at the foothills,<br>
          you will never really know who you truly are.</p>
        <p>Never know the extent of your Might,<br>
          your Unbrekability, your Blinding Light.</p>
        <p>If you stay down,<br>
          you will blend with all the new people coming and going.</p>
        <p>You&apos;ll never be known, never be recognized,<br>
          you may even become forgotten, your judgment clouded.</p>
        <p>It will be hard to recognize,<br>
          the Kindred from the Foe.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>You must rise up, and find your self,<br>
          so that you may be seen for the Brilliant Being that really are.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Help us learn from you,<br>
          from what you have been through,<br>
          from your Great Battles and Works,</p>
        <p>If you hide,<br>
          the Universe will become darker for it.</p>
        <p>We need your light.</p>

        <p>It is a pretty dark trick,<br>
          and it makes life run out all too quick.</p>
        <p>If all were to be tricked to break the link,<br>
          that they can&apos;t climb on giants to think;</p>
        <p>And all became mere muscle and bone,<br>
          humanity would fade in vain, with a deathly moan.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>We have to remind each other, so that we don&apos;t forget,<br>
          or we will fade, without feeling a hint of regret.</p>
        <p>You are meant to become a Great Being,<br>
          you are finely crafted for the Art of Seeing.</p>
        <p>With your unstoppable sight,<br>
          as your greatest might...</p>
        <p>You can understand anything,<br>
          and rise higher than any king,<br>
          it is your right!</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>You are meant to rise, at least to the status of a Hero,<br>
          keep people from running themselves into a zero.</p>
        <p>That power is in each and every one of us,<br>
          and we must be Noble and Wise,<br>
          so that no one can stop us.</p>
        <p>Know with certainty that it is always Spring Season,<br>
          to stand up for Truth &amp; Reason.</p>
        <p>Know that Truth and Beauty is always right,<br>
          and yours, is that Power and Might.</p>

        <p>My Friends, liars happen, because it is easiest to live on the low,<br>
          and never rise, and just hide in the status quo.</p>
        <p>That&apos;s why we often run into a trouble maker,<br>
          it takes no effort to be a faker.</p>
        <p>Leave them, to their own stupid little prison,<br>
          in their web of lies, there cannot be any reason.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>That&apos;s our first shaky step in life,<br>
          to lean to see who&apos;s hiding a knife.</p>
        <p>And then cutting with a sword,<br>
          and setting ourselves free to move onward.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>I promise You, it gets better after this,<br>
          the sun will rise, life will become bliss.</p>
        <p>With each step we take we find more light,<br>
          and baby-step by baby-step, add to our might.</p>
        <p>It is as simple as the math of standing-still versus learning,<br>
          one goes nowhere, and the other eventually fulfills all yearning.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Walk Your path, don&apos;t let the fakers sway You,<br>
          look them in the eyes, and see right through.</p>
        <p>Choose the real over the fantasy they sell,<br>
          and move away from their stupid little hell.</p>
        <p>And if someone ever comes pushing You around,<br>
          use the might of Your wisdom to push them back, and stand Your ground.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>There are so many sweet little treasures within You,<br>
          the one You start with will show You heights You never knew.</p>
        <p>And the higher You rise the more brightly You will glow,<br>
          and You&apos;ll find Your Sweetheart, before You know.</p>
        <p>Life is meant to be lived in Wisdom and Happiness and Laughter,<br>
          Heaven is Right Now - not in some fantasy of after.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>All the things that are worthy of the Beautiful You,<br>
          will never extract a toll, they will only ever add unto You.</p>
        <p>Nobody worthy of You could ever make You feel sad or bad,<br>
          they will foolishly trot and prance to Your rescue, until You feel glad.</p>
        <p>Don&apos;t let fakers trick You into thinking the world is blue,<br>
          The sun, is right over the next mountain, and is already shining for You.</p>
