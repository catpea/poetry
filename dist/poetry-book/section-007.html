        <p>Each day we must learn,<br>
          and what we&apos;ve forgotten re-lean.</p>
        <p>Our life depends on clarity,<br>
          our visions must be sharp.</p>
        <p>A lesson learned, begets a wisdom.<br>
          Two create a kingdom.</p>
        <p>Our might comes from knowledge,<br>
          and you can&apos;t find that in college.</p>
        <p>Life is too short to lean in slices,<br>
          leave them to their own devices.</p>
        <p>You are a powerful being,<br>
          you learn fastest on your own.</p>
        <p>As few teachers there are,<br>
          so there are but a handful of books.</p>
        <p>It will be hard work,<br>
          to fill all the notebooks.</p>
        <p>But your mind is unique, anyway,<br>
          there is no substitute for your own way.</p>
        <p>At first it will be gibberish,<br>
          at last, they will read it feverish.</p>
        <p>You must not be tired,<br>
          your mind cannot be stressed.</p>
        <p>You must resist what they desired,<br>
          tell them you can&apos;t be hired.</p>
        <p>You are not a dime a dozen,<br>
          there is no other like you.</p>
        <p>You have to tend to your mind,<br>
          all the forgotten lessons remind.</p>
        <p>There cannot be anyone like you,<br>
          learn to reach your own breakthrough.</p>
        <p>Set your self free from the silly sting,<br>
          you are not just a little thing.</p>
        <p>No retreat, no surrender.<br>
          You are a meant to become a Great Being.</p>

        <p>Now is the time,<br>
          it is always the time.</p>
        <p>You are never too old,<br>
          you are never too large.</p>
        <p>But whoever you are,<br>
          You are always too beautiful!</p>
        <p>Jogging is a wise teacher,<br>
          it teaches bodybuilding.</p>
        <p>More importantly, it teaches,<br>
          that our bodies are powerful.</p>
        <p>But, they do not adapt as quickly,<br>
          as our fancies strike us.</p>
        <p>There is one fantastic way to jog,<br>
          measure how long you can run.</p>
        <p>And how long you need to rest,<br>
          to run that long again.</p>
        <p>Make the jogging number (1 minute)<br>
          and the rest number (2 minutes)<br>
          your friends for the Spring.</p>
        <p>Rest 5 times, jog four,<br>
          don&apos;t be too hard on yourself.</p>
        <p>Jogging is difficult,<br>
          because you should dance first.</p>
        <p>Dancing and walking,<br>
          are lovely at making you a Jogger.</p>
        <p>But if you are in a hurry,<br>
          as many joggers are,<br>
          a bit of Rest &amp; Jog Tango will do.</p>
        <p>So, rest, jog, rest jog, rest jog,<br>
          rest jog, and rest.</p>
        <p>Don&apos;t push yourself too hard,<br>
          but you have to run each day.</p>
        <p>Some days, you can just walk - so as long,<br>
          as it is three times longer than your jog.</p>
        <p>Above all, be good to yourself,<br>
          because, you are beautiful to me.</p>
        <p>And do not forget that you can put,<br>
          blueberry jam into a huge salad,<br>
          to make a new kind of fruit for health nuts.</p>
        <p>I know you can do it,<br>
          I believe in you, I really do.</p>

        <p>Oh it was cold that morning,<br>
          the sudden change came without warning.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0063-cold.jpg" alt="Cold"></p>
        <p>While the sunsets are over the sea,<br>
          the sunrise, must rise from behind dunes.</p>
        <p>There are no dunes taller than these,<br>
          they are ancient, born of frozen seas.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0063-mist.jpg" alt="Mist"></p>
        <p>The deer were the first to rise,<br>
          to them belonged the sunrise.</p>
        <p>There is a place where the dunes part,<br>
          by some unknown art.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0063-art.jpg" alt="Art"></p>
        <p>The deers come out,<br>
          it is their lake, no doubt.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0063-deer.jpg" alt="Deer"></p>
        <p>When the sun finally made it,<br>
          the warm air rolled down the dune.</p>
        <p>The symphony of the ancient forest,<br>
          perfectly in tune.</p>
        <p>Then the birds rose,<br>
          and their breakfast followed.</p>
        <p>Two eagles came by,<br>
          to keep an eye from the sky.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0063-seagull.jpg" alt="Seagull"></p>
        <p>My beloved Seagull friend and I rejoiced,<br>

        <p>(My seagull friend&apos;s name is Bob.<br>
          I called them all Bob.</p>
        <p>I had difficulty telling them apart,<br>
          but I sure got their names right.</p>

        <p>If everyone seems scary,<br>
          that&apos;s only because scary is all you&apos;ve ever met.</p>
        <p>I&apos;ve met them too, I saw what they can do.<br>
          How sure of themselves, how forward and blind.</p>
        <p>But, if you spend your life in hiding,<br>
          they will win, and rob you of everything precious.</p>
        <p>So rise, begin taking care of yourself,<br>
          and begin your search.</p>
        <p>Not a search for mere friends,<br>
          but a search for The Extraordinary.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>It is simple.<br>
          My friends.</p>
        <p>The only way to find The Extraordinary,<br>
          is to become Extraordinary yourself.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>If you got hurt before,<br>
          then you have already come a long way.</p>
        <p>You now hold a gift of Wisdom,<br>
          a Foresight that can spare suffering.</p>
        <p>No one is to take Love of Life from you,<br>
          no one is to rob you of Joy and Laughter.</p>

        <p>My friends, as mighty as we are,<br>
          we can only do one thing at a time.</p>
        <p>Once you take care to choose the big things well,<br>
          the one thing before you...</p>
        <p>is what the big thing will depend on,<br>
          do it well.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Small things will sneak up on you,<br>
          and I am so sorry for that.</p>
        <p>It is the job of our Teachers to help us,<br>
          but today there are very few.</p>
        <p>You have to accept the responsibility,<br>
          you must fight for wisdom at all cost.</p>
        <p>In the absence of teachers,<br>
          you must become your teacher, it is your right.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>If you fail to educate yourself,<br>
          people will use you.</p>
        <p>They will use the best of you,<br>
          Your Generosity, Your Kindness, Your Might.</p>
        <p>They will pay you less,<br>
          and trick you to thank them that you still have the job.</p>
        <p>They will replace you with younger people,<br>
          come your Golden Age, to save a dollar.</p>
        <p>Come a tragedy,<br>
          they will use it to make you work harder.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>All of this is hard to see,<br>
          it brings so much relief and pleasure.</p>
        <p>It feels so right to choose,<br>
          but you are so much more than a worker.</p>
        <p>You must ask, if the path that you are on,<br>
          is worthy of the Magnificent Being you are.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>You are meant to become a Great Being,<br>
          you have to climb to see the Big Things.</p>
        <p>Even as a Great Being, my friends,<br>
          always look to the Big Things.</p>
        <p>Do not waste your precious time,<br>
          to achieve that which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozymandias">crumbles</a>.</p>
        <p>Look towards real things,<br>
          things that really last.</p>

        <p>When hoping to live life to the fullest,<br>
          we have to choose the big things very carefully.</p>
        <p>Health, is an example of a big thing,<br>
          everything we do, must stand in support of it.</p>
        <p>Time, is a big thing,<br>
          everything we do, must count.</p>
        <p>We must frequently ask,<br>
          &quot;Is this event harming or helping me?&quot;</p>
        <p>We must frequently ask,<br>
          &quot;Will this matter in six months, or next year?&quot;</p>
        <p>We must ask,<br>
          &quot;What are the regrets of my older self?&quot;</p>
        <p>Because only you can judge yourself,<br>
          you must grow in wisdom, and age gracefully.</p>
        <p>Do not miss the point of life -<br>
          You are meant to become a Great Being.</p>
        <p>You are to search and find the Light of Your Life,<br>
          and discover a way contribute to Wisdom.</p>
