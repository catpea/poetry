        <p>Don&apos;t just move forward,<br>
          you have to move up!</p>
        <p>Life is too short,<br>
          You are too Noble,<br>
          Truth is too Dear.</p>
        <p>Many give away their Time,<br>
          some even give away Trust.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, because they are tired,<br>
          because they had enough,<br>
          or had waited long enough.</p>
        <p>Giving something of yourself away,<br>
          will not make that other person Nobler.</p>
        <p>And you are not supposed to wait,<br>
          in waiting all your life will pass you by.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>You are supposed to learn,<br>
          you are supposed to move,<br>
          you are supposed to shine.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>You will lose your mind if you do noting,<br>
          and You will lose your self, unless you grow up.</p>
        <p>You&apos;ll never lose the ability to turn around,<br>
          and try again, it maybe harder if you wait too long...</p>
        <p>... but in your waiting,<br>
          you&apos;ll become tougher too.</p>
        <p>No, there is no point of no return,<br>
          but all those who rise, would agree:</p>
        <p>&quot;Do it sooner than later&quot;.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Begin, by taking back what you have given away,<br>
          and permanently and meaningfully so, and rise up.</p>
        <p>There is no art to this,<br>
          you just pick yourself up, and go.</p>
        <p>You&apos;re going to need running shoes,<br>
          and your first battle will be with Fatigue.</p>
        <p>Be good to yourself,<br>
          strive to be better,<br>
          let your body rest enough so it may grow stronger.</p>
        <p>And return to point Zero,<br>
          go all the way back.</p>
        <p>Of all the noble things within You,<br>
          not a single thing is to be shared unearned.</p>
        <p>And listen carefully, to the words spoken to you,<br>
          by inference re-construct that which drives others.</p>
        <p>And find the Kindred, and the Kin,<br>
          do not be alone for too long.</p>
        <p>Isolation is as bad as Fatigue,<br>
          it is a state of having fallen, and being lost.</p>
        <p>You are To Thrive,<br>
          You are To Grow.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Keep searching, keep training,<br>
          stay away from hate, and those who fell behind on growing up.</p>
        <p>Keep learning,<br>
          keep moving,<br>
          let yourself shine.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Nothing important in life is found at the foothills,<br>
          you have to get to the mountains, and carry on climbing.</p>
        <p>Do not stop,<br>
          and keep moving up.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>As to what it is all for,<br>
          it is to better yourself.</p>
        <p>To rise above yourself to new thoughts,<br>
          and powers, and insights, and observations.</p>
        <p>If you stay at the foothills,<br>
          you will never really know who you truly are.</p>
        <p>Never know the extent of your Might,<br>
          your Unbrekability, your Blinding Light.</p>
        <p>If you stay down,<br>
          you will blend with all the new people coming and going.</p>
        <p>You&apos;ll never be known, never be recognized,<br>
          you may even become forgotten, your judgment clouded.</p>
        <p>It will be hard to recognize,<br>
          the Kindred from the Foe.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>You must rise up, and find your self,<br>
          so that you may be seen for the Brilliant Being that really are.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Help us learn from you,<br>
          from what you have been through,<br>
          from your Great Battles and Works,</p>
        <p>If you hide,<br>
          the Universe will become darker for it.</p>
        <p>We need your light.</p>
