        <p>Captain&apos;s Log, Day Twelve of Quarantine. I ordered some trailmix from the internet, mailman dropped it off by the door and all the local Squirrels I&apos;ve been feeding came over, ripped the box open, and ate it. How rude, I probably shoudn&apos;t have been feeding them all this time.</p>
