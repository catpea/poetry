        <p>Captain&apos;s Log, Quarantine, Day Twenty Five,</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Bernie dropped out.</p>
        <p>I didn&apos;t even try to wait, you can&apos;t place this much weight.</p>
        <p>And what were we expecting?</p>
        <p>It has always been like this, hit and miss.</p>
        <p>It is time for all, to rise.</p>
        <p>Become a Citizen of The World. In your own hands.</p>
        <p>With your own mind. Seek Knowledge and Triumph.</p>
        <p>Let the name of this New Nation be, Earth,</p>
        <p>May the Citizen be called, a Human.</p>
        <p>The power is in your hands, so near,</p>
        <p>rooted in every audio-book you can hear.</p>
        <p>And you have to lean to rise,</p>
        <p>you can&apos;t near the skies,</p>
        <p>without your eyes!</p>
        <p>When you have learned enough, you have to turn around and teach.</p>
        <p>Yell from your mountain, scream, dance and preach.</p>
        <p>The promise of Freedom, Reason, and Peace,</p>
        <p>is in our hands, it is our Masterpiece.</p>
        <p>Education is <a href="http://catpea.com/warrior">fun</a> it only ever seems hard,</p>
        <p>because one is trying to learn too much in too little time.</p>
        <p>The only way we can fully learn,</p>
        <p>is by inheriting knowledge from World&apos;s most beloved Heroes.</p>
        <p>This inheritance begins by following in their footstep, first;</p>
        <p>and continues, when we break away to resume where they left off.</p>
        <p>Rise, rise to the mountains before you.</p>
        <p>The only way,</p>
        <p>is to go up,</p>
        <p>to grow up,</p>
        <p>to grow all the way up,</p>
        <p>until we each become a Great Being.</p>
        <p>Same as those before us,</p>
        <p>same as those that are sure to rise.</p>
        <p>Open Your Eyes.</p>
        <p>The Time is Always Now.</p>

        <p>Captain&apos;s Log, Quarantine Serserge, Day Twenty Four,</p>
        <p>I am ready to jump into my bed like a big dinosaur.</p>
        <p>I am dressed, I am wearing my favorite workout clothes,</p>
        <p>I stretched left and right, and fluffed up my pillows.</p>
        <p>For tonight, I prepared, a Bill Bryson Auidobook I adore,</p>
        <p>Even though I am already so sleepy that I could snore.</p>
        <p>I will listen about the <a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/A-Short-History-of-Nearly-Everything-Audiobook/B002V0KFPW">History of the World</a>,</p>
        <p>about all the mysterious things and places we explored.</p>
        <p>This is how I go to sleep every night,</p>
        <p>the book will slowly play... until daylight.</p>
        <p>I learned so much from online lectures and audio books,</p>
        <p>that these days, I can focus on my good looks.</p>
        <p>Oh, how I miss working out at the gym,</p>
        <p>but I am still working hard to be slim.</p>
        <p>Let us all be of good cheer,</p>
        <p>quarantine will be over soon,</p>
        <p>that is clear.</p>

        <p>It was a super busy day, not a moment for tea.</p>
        <p>And I keep Programming late into the night,</p>
        <p>typing like a Lion with all his might.</p>
        <p>This morn, I woke up and made Peanut Butter and Jelly,</p>
        <p>I&apos;ve been programming all day, I keep going like the telly.</p>
        <p>Now, I am trying to figure out, a datatype for verse,</p>
        <p>my stanza CSS padding and margins are intense.</p>
        <p>I am not trying to be a hero, hey!</p>
        <p>but I am writing this, in a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array">JavaScript Array</a>!</p>
        <p>I don&apos;t know if there is anymore I can say,</p>
        <p>other than that I am OK,</p>
        <p>and that this has been an OK day.</p>
        <p>No wait, I&apos;ll add this:</p>

        <p>Captain&apos;s Log, Eternal, Quarantine, Day Twenty Two.</p>
        <p>Eeeeek! It&apos;s raining, I am trying not to be complaining.<br>
          But the sky is no longer blue, what am I to do?</p>
        <p>Each time I sneeze, the power goes out,<br>
          not to say my sneezes are not petite, or that I am ill!</p>
        <p>No, I am perfectly fine, I don&apos;t need to blow my nose.<br>
          It is the transformer outside that blows!</p>
        <p>Frantically, atomically I hit CTRL+S, CTRL+S, save, save. Saves,<br>
          as the thunderous thunder thunders its electromagnetic waves.</p>
        <p>How am I going to finish, how can I upload,<br>
          when any moment something will explode,<br>
          and there will be nothing where current once flowed.</p>
        <p>While the rain has slowed, my fingers still tapping,<br>
          Save, save, save! rise! against the Gigawatt Wave.</p>
        <p>Seriously, please remember to save your files,<br>
          this can only result in more smiles.</p>
        <p>Also, please remember to backup your files.<br>
          As that&apos;s even better, by miles.</p>

        <p>Captain&apos;s Log: Quarantine.</p>
        <p>Day Twenty One.</p>
        <p>There is birdsong outside, and I can feel the sun.</p>
        <p>I woke up rested, for the first time, in years.</p>
        <p>My mind was hardly ever tired, but all the rest needed time.</p>
        <p>I am ready for gyms to reopen, It will be so much fun.</p>
        <p>I will dance even faster, workout longer.</p>
        <p>My diet is twice as good as it was before,</p>
        <p>including soup, and proper portion control.</p>
        <p>It took twenty one days,</p>
        <p>for my body to begin recovering from my workouts.</p>
        <p>What a great sadness it would be, to wish now,</p>
        <p>that I should have danced, or tried harder.</p>
        <p>Instead, here I am. Bouncy, and perky as heck,</p>
        <p>Ready to go back.</p>
        <p>Use your days wisely,</p>
        <p>let no day slip away.</p>
        <p>Live, make each day count,</p>
        <p>it all adds together, balance your account.</p>
        <p>What makes us great,</p>
        <p>is the sum of all the days in the past.</p>
        <p>What makes us strong,</p>
        <p>is making each day better than the one before.</p>
        <p>Make each day count,</p>
        <p>enlarge your world.</p>

        <p>Captain&apos;s Log: Quarantine. Day Twenty,</p>
        <p>the promised day of rhyme a plenty.</p>
        <p>I am sitting here with my salad,</p>
        <p>expecting to write world&apos;s littlest ballad.</p>
        <p>I waited until the conclusion of day,</p>
        <p>to see with what rhymes that may pay.</p>
        <p>Alas, twenty just about rhymes with plenty,</p>
        <p>it rhymes as good as yeti and orange.</p>
        <p>On the other hand Twenty One,</p>
        <p>rhymes with all under the sun.</p>
        <p>I am sitting here smacking my lips,</p>
        <p>Counting down 90 days to Penumbral Eclipse.</p>
        <p>I made little sausages to add to my salad,</p>
        <p>I added really spicy dressing to spruce up my ballad.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0025-a.jpg" alt="A"></p>
        <p>My Little Fort (note orange tent in the center)</p>
        <p>As I grilled the little things, I remembered that same smell,</p>
        <p>it was back when I lived in the ancient dune wilderness.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0025-x.jpg" alt="X"></p>
        <p>Little Sausage Dinner</p>
        <p>That memory really rings a bell,</p>
        <p>It was at the height of my loneliness.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0025-b.jpg" alt="B"></p>
        <p>My Evening Couch, as I waited for Lake Michigan Sunsets</p>
        <p>Deep woods, ancient dunes,</p>
        <p>and warm and sunny afternoons.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0025-k.jpg" alt="K"></p>
        <p>Deep in Woods</p>
        <p>Not all afternoons were sunny, I once got a heck of a reminder,</p>
        <p>One cold afternoon I remembered that I get scared of thunder.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0025-c.jpg" alt="C"></p>
        <p>And My Evening Wear</p>
        <p>Not, little thunder of course,</p>
        <p>the scary ones, that always strike with great force.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0025-t.jpg" alt="T"></p>
        <p>Dark Evening</p>
        <p>It was almost never scary, certainly never scary for long,</p>
        <p>it would pass, and moon or sun would rise, followed by birdsong.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0025-h.jpg" alt="H"></p>
        <p>People taking photos of my Horses</p>
        <p>I remember by the beach many stood,</p>
        <p>as I built horses out of driftwood,</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0025-i.jpg" alt="I"></p>
        <p>Horse 2.0</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0025-j.jpg" alt="J"></p>
        <p>Horse 3.0</p>
        <p>The height of my loneliness,</p>
        <p>also came with a great deal of silliness,</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0025-l.jpg" alt="L"></p>
        <p>Beach House</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0025-m.jpg" alt="M"></p>
        <p>Beach House</p>
        <p>I waived to the future, and to today,</p>
        <p>Look at me, I am a Cowboy! Say, Hey!</p>

        <p>Captain&apos;s Log: Day Nineteen of Quarantine.</p>
        <p>Tomorrow, day twenty may have rhyme a plenty,</p>
        <p>but it won&apos;t rhyme with quarantine, and that was unforeseen.</p>
        <p>I waited all day to write,</p>
        <p>to see if something interesting may bite.</p>
        <p>I wanted to draw and paint, and dance and prance,</p>
        <p>but ended up discovering a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6_QUhUPrF4">poem about taking chance</a>.</p>
        <p>I ended up programming, music and art,</p>
        <p>I aimed to do something relaxing, but smart.</p>
        <p>Such are meow days, and had been forever and more,</p>
        <p>searching for all things special and all the things I adore.</p>
        <p>Now, I am finishing today&apos;s poem, one foot already in bed,</p>
        <p>Though I already had my salad, I wonder if I should make some bread.</p>
        <p>That&apos;s sounds about right,</p>
        <p>I&apos;ll waddle downstairs and grab a bite.</p>
        <p>Goodnight.</p>
