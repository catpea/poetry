        <p>At the center of our being,<br>
          we each have a collection.</p>
        <p>It makes us unique,<br>
          but we never lose our connection.</p>
        <p>As with all things in life,<br>
          it is too easy to get lost in strife.</p>
        <p>We have to protect what makes us unique,<br>
          if you fail, your future will be bleak.</p>
        <p>With all things we do,<br>
          sometimes the bad guys slip through.</p>
        <p>This is what we need courage for,<br>
          to look them in the eyes, and slam the door.</p>
        <p>The unique collection at our center, is our power.<br>
          It transforms, and evolves, hour after hour.</p>
        <p>We start with just the Ocean, Skies, Mountains, Stars, Earth and Mars,<br>
          maybe Flowers, Gardens, Kittens, Dogs, Horses and Frogs.</p>
        <p>But then it grows, call it soul, or spirit, personality or vitality,<br>
          it becomes... Beauty, Endurance, Authenticity, Nobility, Love and Dignity.</p>
        <p>And it keeps growing, so as long as you Love Yourself,</p>
        <p>It creates Leaders, Protectors, Guides, Teachers, Dreamers,<br>
          Adventurers, Explorers and Discoverers,<br>
          Intellectuals, Humanitarians, Philosophers,<br>
          Scientists, Astronomers,<br>
          Dancers, Athletes, Bodybuilders,<br>
          Chefs, Blacksmiths, and Makers,<br>
          Musicians, Poets, Sculptors, Photographers and Filmmakers,<br>
          Artists and Designers,<br>
          Hackers and Programmers,<br>
          Genius...<br>
          Visionaries...<br>
          Founders....</p>
        <p>You have to protect what makes you unique at all cost,<br>
          if you start letting go, you will become lost.</p>
        <p>And many will come, and many with care and kindness,<br>
          and they will try to change you, in their blindness.</p>
        <p>You cannot grow up, if you start letting go,<br>
          you need an unbroken chain, you need that flow.</p>
        <p>You have to learn to say,<br>
          that it&apos;s either you, the one one who stands and is true,<br>
          or you are through.</p>
        <p>To grow up, into who you need to be,<br>
          is your right, and your dignity.</p>
        <p>To let bullies push you around,<br>
          is to fail, and falter,<br>
          and run aground.</p>
        <p>Decades, decades after they are long gone, do not let go,<br>
          do not take their turns, do not change your view,<br>
          you must aim to become worthy of you.</p>
        <p>Whether you believe in Heroes,<br>
          on that we are only Human.</p>
        <p>It is the same height,<br>
          just a maximum of our might.</p>
        <p>Push, and stand up, and aim up, and rise,<br>
          Open your eyes,<br>
          it is the only way to become wise.</p>
        <p>Fight for who you are,<br>
          because in time,<br>
          that fight is also for who you need to be.</p>
        <p>For who you need to be,<br>
          to be strong and healthy,<br>
          and unbreakable and worthy.</p>
