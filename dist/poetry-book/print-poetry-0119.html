        <p>For those of you who had trouble,
          finding the Northern end of the I-275 Bicycle Tail.</p>
        <p>Hines connects North and South parts,<br>
          but it is really hard to find the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/AimpKxWarbhiX8zbA">North Entry Point</a></p>
        <p>I got on my bicycle today,<br>
          and took some pictures.</p>
        <p>You have to find the M-14 Overpass,<br>
          or an Overpass with a huge dark rail beneath.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0119-ramp-rail.jpg" alt="Ramp Rail"></p>
        <p>That rail is the support beam,<br>
          for the Trail On-ramp.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0119-ramp-hiding.jpg" alt="Ramp Hiding"></p>
        <p>A bit further down the road,<br>
          there is a road that leads up to the On-ramp.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0119-ramp-access.jpg" alt="Ramp Access"></p>
        <p>It is a ramp specially made,<br>
          for the Handsome Adventurous Bicyclist.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0119-ramp-meow.jpg" alt="Ramp Meow"></p>
        <p>It opens like the door to a secret garden,<br>
          very few people bicycle there.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0119-continues.jpg" alt="Continues"></p>
        <p>The trail continues for many more miles,<br>
          all the way up to 14 Mile Road.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0119-forever.jpg" alt="Forever"></p>
        <p>Over at 14 Mile it ends wonderfully unceremoniously,<br>
          it just pops out onto a sidewalk.</p>
        <p>Where motorists jump in their cars slightly,<br>
          as you pop out somewhat dehydrated, a little crazed, and a bit wild.</p>
