        <p>Growing up, getting up, moving up, rising up,<br>
          we each have this abstract sense of a special direction.</p>
        <p>It calls to us when we are down,<br>
          and it calls when we <strong>can</strong> go higher.</p>
        <p>You don&apos;t even need to speak a language,<br>
          just lift you finger and point to the sky.</p>
        <p>It works for everything and every time,<br>
          it encourages us to continue to rise.</p>
        <p>There is always an up,<br>
          and never an end in sight.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Growing up demands that we open our eyes and rise,<br>
          stand our ground and look to the skies.</p>
        <p>So as long as we aim for the tallest of mountains and rise,<br>
          our knowledge will quickly catch up in size.</p>
        <p>Wherever we begin, we <strong>can</strong> rise,<br>
          to grow in wisdom to no end, <strong>is</strong> the ultimate prize.</p>
        <p>May we each discover our path to wisdom and rise,<br>
          cheerfully becoming mighty and wise.</p>

        <p>A Powerful Summer Storm approached with mighty thunder and powerful showers,<br>
          and as always my power went out for for some twenty four hours.</p>
        <p>I love Mother Nature and her Cosmic Powers,<br>
          with this much rain there can only be more blooming flowers.</p>
        <p>But, yah, as soon as the power went out,<br>
          my apartment went completely dark.</p>
        <p>My air conditioning was gone too;<br>
          I tried to turn on the window fan before I realized &quot;I need to think that one through.&quot;</p>
        <p>All my extravagantly blinking computers and phones,<br>
          either shutdown or chirped their sad little low-battery tones.</p>
        <p>I watched the sun go down with a sigh,<br>
          and so the only thing left blinking was the smoke detectors and I.</p>

        <p>We are not Island Universes scattered to no end in some void,<br>
          we are a part of a growing civilization with a past and a future.</p>
        <p>And we might have become confused about the Scope of Our Existence,<br>
          we stand divided by borders and committed to repeating history&apos;s mistakes.</p>
        <p>It is unwise to pretend to be able to handle a great responsibility,<br>
          only desperation, fractures, and exploitation by other desperate pretenders can follow.</p>
        <p>Those who are granted authority are often not wise enough to handle it,<br>
          and in their mediocrity they commit what in larger scope translates to real Crimes Against Humanity.</p>
        <p>There cannot be wisdom without understanding and inheriting from past generations,<br>
          the transfer of knowledge occurs by means of Understanding Books.</p>
        <p>And there cannot be understanding without Authenticity,<br>
          in haste of chasing a career there can only be memorization and misunderstanding.</p>
        <p>We must keep in mind; that what the future generations do not perceive as clear progress,<br>
          will be seen as the continuation of dark ages with authorities on the wrong side of history.</p>
        <p>The World United, is not a fairy-tale, nor should it be a mere dream for us,<br>
          but a Gift of Peace for The Future Generations, so that they may grow in Dignity, Health, and Wisdom.</p>
        <p>We are neither disconnected from the future generations, nor the past generations,<br>
          we are a stepping stone in the development of The Human Kind.</p>
        <p>And we should recognize this Great Honor and Reward,<br>
          and understand that the larger context is found in helping to build a better world for future generations.</p>
        <p>All our decisions, across all levels and authorities,<br>
          Police, Attorneys and Judges, Parents, Teachers and Principals, Mayors, Governors, Prime Misters and Presidents, and everybody else...</p>
        <p>Must be mindful of future generations, of a growing world, of making lasting and meaningful contributions to the entire human kind,<br>
          a World that will eventually become united and free of borders.</p>
        <p>A world with future generations that will look back at us,<br>
          right now, right here, with questions that we must present answers to.</p>
        <p>We are getting stuck in circles,<br>
          because people are forgetting history&apos;s lessons.</p>
        <p>Because we are not thinking on a large enough scale,<br>
          we end up building more prisons rather than ending poverty with meaningful prevention programs.</p>
        <p>Endless cycles of heartless poverty that freeze the best of us,<br>
          poverty that wouldn&apos;t even be a feature of modern society had we in our wisdom recognized it for what it is.</p>
        <p>Poverty denies people food and well being,<br>
          causes stress and great harm to mind and body.</p>
        <p>Love above Law, before we allow the practice of law,<br>
          we must end the cycles of poverty.</p>
        <p>Money must not be used to limit people,<br>
          it is meant to help.</p>
        <p>And how can a culture be to fail to see, how a young person allowed to build a business without the threat of homelessness and starvation,<br>
          will contribute back to the city and everyone&apos;s well being.</p>
        <p>What is so hard about seeing that rather than sending non-violent criminals to prison,<br>
          we can prevent their biggest mistakes by putting an end to their worries of sleeping hungry on the street.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Any time, we fail to keep to reality,<br>
          be it sending a 15 year old lady to prison, or denying science, or tolerating arrests by obscured or unidentified agencies, or abuses of power or discretion.</p>
        <p>We create fractures and distrust,<br>
          blindly defacing and destroying work of many much wiser great beings, who gave their best trusting that we can carry on, in wisdom.</p>
        <p>We must not move against the grain of reality,<br>
          any and all divergence will only create a cascade of fractures that will demand constant attention<br>
          and result in nothing more than systems that merely stand to support themselves and as an affront to justice and future generations.</p>
        <p>Where there was once a solution as clear as helping children to inherit the wisdom of their elders,<br>
          we now see the emergence of a failed and impotent educational system with a mass incarceration backed.</p>
        <p>Wisdom and inheritance of knowledge cannot be replaced by a &quot;fake it until you make it&quot; trickery,<br>
          the work of great beings must not be stained by people who fail to see their vision.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Once again, the world grows a generation at a time,<br>
          the education of the teenagers from 20 years ago is currently influencing the state of the world.</p>
        <p>Likewise, how we treat out children today,<br>
          will have a monumental impact on the world 20 years from now.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Let us honor our children and all the future generations by encouraging them to books,<br>
          by reminding them of the Great Power of Thinking Beings, of Philosophers and Lovers of Wisdom.</p>
        <p>By reminding them that their Pursuit of Excellence,<br>
          can only make the world a better place for us all, and even those that are yet to come.</p>
        <p>Let us remind them that Books (and now Audio Books) serve as a wonderful source of our wisdom,<br>
          especially when read in a sequence that fits them best, and understood at thier own pace.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Let us remind each other that we must reject short thinking and shortest paths,<br>
          that do not help the world grow and keep us divided.</p>
        <p>Let us break out of that selfish endless loop of repeating mistakes of past generations,<br>
          by working towards a better world a more united world where we recognize each other as One Family.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>And let us remember that the great and wise beings of past generations,<br>
          demand that we honor hard won triumphs and do not repeat history&apos;s mistakes.</p>
        <p>The very nature of that demand requires that once we take to wisdom,<br>
          we must stop following orders, and begin thinking, evaluating, and judging for ourselves.</p>
        <p>To honor triumphs and guard against heartbreaking mistakes,<br>
          is the duty we hold to those who came before us,<br>
          and all the future generations that are yet to follow.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>As children we are asked to listen and follow,<br>
          as we grow we must learn to Lead and become Unbreakable.</p>
        <p>It is not just the challenges of life that will test us,<br>
          we must also think and evaluate and reject that which is wrong.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>We are constantly made to listen and expected to follow,<br>
          look behind any protest, or scandal, or angry headline.</p>
        <p>We must judge all the contradictory information for ourselves,<br>
          and make an informed decision as to whether or not majority is correct.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Life will always challenge us,<br>
          and My Goodness - times are always changing.</p>
        <p>Humanity is constantly bettering her self,<br>
          what used to be acceptable - may now, be an affront to justice.</p>
        <p>And while there isn&apos;t enough time to comprehend all the books,<br>
          there is plenty of time to be come a Loving and Wise Compassionate Human Being,</p>
        <p>Let us remember that we are a chain-link between the Hard Work of Past Generations,<br>
          and the United, Free from Poverty, and Peaceful Word of <strong>Future</strong> Generations.</p>
        <p>We are One Growing Family, and that is the correct context for local, state, and federal levels, for all legal and administrative decision making,<br>
          to diverge from this reality is to get stuck in an endless loop of repeating history&apos;s mistakes, the very thing that the past generations are asking us not to do.</p>

        <p>The only guarantee we have is Ourselves,<br>
          the one Element that we are truly in control of.</p>
        <p>The deliberate act of Growing Up,<br>

        <p>Dusk and Twilight, Tears in the Rain, and Aches in Every Muscle,<br>

          when all else has gone dark, the choice always remains.</p>
        <p>And when we can no longer change the World,<br>

        <p>No matter what misery or battles mark our past,<br>
          having chosen to Rise, and Learn, and Rebuild; made us Beautiful.</p>
        <p>No matter what challenges lie ahead,<br>
          The Great Act of Growing Up, is an Inexhaustible Source of Unlimited Wisdom.</p>

        <p>Nope, we may not finish school, get a job, buy a house, and worry about old age;<br>
          My Dear fiends, I forbid you, and you&apos;re not even not allowed anyway.</p>
        <p>I don&apos;t know who came up with thins nonsense,<br>
          and I don&apos;t know why our parents repeat it - though I have some theories.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>You are to figure out what moves you,<br>
          and get on with it.</p>
        <p>What moves you,<br>
          is also what helps you grow.</p>
        <p>What moves you,<br>
          will make you extremely strong and beautiful.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>And it may very well be that it is some kind of a career,<br>
          but there will certainly be something better.</p>
        <p>Becoming a professional,<br>
          and spending the rest of your life as that professional - are very different things.</p>
        <p>In deed.</p>
        <p>And what is more, my Dear Fiends,<br>
          is that you will be making that initial choice under the influence;<br>
          of being too young to actually make decisions of that magnitude.</p>
        <p>You will surely be beautiful and powerful enough to make it,<br>
          but when you enter your early Mighty Middle Age,<br>
          you will be even more Beautiful and even more Capable.</p>
        <p>What seemed like a Delicious Challenge in your youth,<br>
          will no longer challenge you enough.</p>
        <p>I am sorry.</p>
        <p>But something as simple as a fine direction chosen in early life,<br>
          will soon be no longer be enough to do you justice.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Life is living.</p>
        <p>It will never be as simple as quitting gym,<br>
          and saying &quot;I can&apos;t... I have a job now.&quot;.</p>
        <p>Nope.</p>
        <p>Nuh uh.</p>
        <p>Now, you need to quit your job,<br>
          and start catching up, surpass what you once were, and now build on top of that.</p>
        <p>Your undertakings are,<br>
          are not to subtract from you.</p>
        <p>Our lives come with a limit,<br>
          it is a terrible tragedy, and I am very sorry.</p>
        <p>But it also makes it that much more important,<br>
          that we grow, that we flourish, that we bloom.</p>
        <p>That every new day of our life,<br>
          adds to the previous.</p>
        <p>When all our pursuits are connected meaningfully together in authenticity,<br>
          they become an enormous treasure, and a song of ourselves.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Life may look simple from the first step before we start growing up.</p>
        <p>But it becomes clear that it is more important to live an Inspired Existence that Adds Unto Us,<br>
          at the very least, because of how much we grow, and how much more we become the best of ourselves.</p>
        <p>Life is so dear,<br>
          it is not a very good idea to follow what someone else expects of us.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>You are always growing in complexity,<br>
          and the universe around you will unfold as more complex too.</p>
        <p>For example, we don&apos;t get old,<br>
          we grow, we expand, eventually gaining the ability to speak about our experience; and inspire and move crowds.</p>
        <p>Growing old is what a brainless fruit does,<br>
          we are Philosophers, Poets, Artists,<br>
          we are always growing, renewing, living, we don&apos;t lose anything - we gain.</p>

        <p>Good to see you, my Enormous Old Friend,<br>
          how long has it been now?</p>
        <p>You haven&apos;t aged a day,<br>
          and as promised I grew in Wisdom, and Strength, and I maybe a bit Taller.</p>
        <p>I bet they finally fixed that <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@40.7060248,-73.9967572,2a,75y,286.07h,64.46t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sGiVjQ4_lsY3jlLY0PM3KEA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en">achy bench</a> on the Manhattan side,<br>
          I promise to come sit, some day.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>When I came to America,<br></p>
        <p>The Bridge, Lady Liberty, and the Old Twins<br>
          kept me company.</p>
        <p>We&apos;d sit calmly together,<br>
          making excuses and promises.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>The New York County Supreme Court was my only other friend,<br>
          and I still love her dearly, but we don&apos;t speak anymore.</p>
        <p>I wanted to be a Judge,<br>
          a Philosopher King as I used to think of them - but I think better now.</p>
        <p>I think in my old age, I&apos;ll come to <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@40.714548,-74.0024396,3a,75y,102.05h,105.41t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1smigFc8sXfFR7X-Jni_7Ogg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?hl=en">her stairs</a>,<br>
          and I will wear my suit,<br>
          and I will wear those shoes that the lawyers went up and down the stairs in - back in 96.<br></p>
        <p>I will read her words again,<br>
          &quot;THE TRUE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IS THE FIRMEST PILLAR OF GOOD GOVERNMENT&quot;,<br>
          But if she could speak, I&apos;d ask about Fair Starts, Prevention, and Rehabilitation, now.</p>
        <p>We drifted apart.<br></p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>I made a little pilgrimage after the Twins Feel,<br>
          I went to see if all was healing properly, and it was,<br>
          workers were preparing the site for what would become the Freedom Tower.</p>
        <p>The city was unchanged,<br>
          it was still the same people.</p>
        <p>&quot;Home Sweet Home&quot; - I said out of awe and nostalgia<br>
          as we turned to see the New York City Skyline framed in the bus window,<br>
          &quot;Damn Right&quot; the person next to me muttered.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>That broken bench on the Manhattan side,<br>
          was my bench, we connected instantly, I was breathless - it is a long walk.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>The things I&apos;d ponder about back then were supremely simple.</p>
        <p>Like, &quot;When is it going to stop raining&quot;, and,<br>
          &quot;Will they let me back on the Subway in a coat this wet?&quot;</p>
        <p>and I wanted to know more about what Ferris Bueller said;<br>
          &quot;Life moves pretty fast. If you don&#x2019;t stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.&quot;</p>
        <p>But it turned out, I&apos;d never let go of a year without trying to learn something new and lasting,<br>
          years were always too precious for me, I&apos;d claw at Decembers like a cat going after his favorite toy.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Mostly, I would sit there quietly,<br>
          watch the occasional jogger.</p>
        <p>Stare at the cars going left and right beneath me, and boats going up and down East River,<br>
          I remember always having some sweets on me, the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@40.7060248,-73.9967572,2a,75y,286.07h,64.46t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sGiVjQ4_lsY3jlLY0PM3KEA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en">old bench</a> is a great place for a Picnic.</p>

          and they will piece your heart right back together.</p>
        <p>Audio books will make your heart whole,<br>
          and they will add great Wisdom and Strength to your Soul.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>And Let Me Tell You,</p>
