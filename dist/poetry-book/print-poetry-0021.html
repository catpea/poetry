        <p>Captain&apos;s Log: Day Sixteen of Quarantine.</p>
        <p>Keeping it serious like Wolverine.</p>
        <p>I have decided not to rhyme,</p>
        <p>I really haven&apos;t got the time.</p>
        <p>I must leave the thieving Squirrels behind,</p>
        <p>yes, really, I don&apos;t mind.</p>
        <p>Today, is a new day, I am completely serious,</p>
        <p>I am going to ignore everything hilarious.</p>
        <p>I am not even joking, I&apos;ll ignore those furriers,</p>
        <p>I won&apos;t even pay attention to their funny scurries.</p>
        <p>I will sit here quiet,</p>
        <p>tending to my amazing diet...</p>
        <p>A stray thought bubbles to my idle mind,</p>
        <p>Oh, no, I hope people won&apos;t go blind!</p>
        <p>I think I am going to YouTube my workout dance,</p>
        <p>Now, where the heck did I put my underpants?</p>
