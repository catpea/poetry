        <p>No worries, the only real darkness is the Twilight of Hesitation,<br>
          it is dangerous because it makes time go by all too fast.</p>
        <p>So you just have to make a promise to your self,<br>
          that each day will be a tiny-tiny itsy-bitsy better; than then previous.</p>
        <p>Other than that, no cloud could ever stop the sun from rising,<br>
          nothing can endanger your brilliance, there is nothing to fear.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>And brilliance,<br>
          brilliance leads to enlightenment.</p>
        <p>So as long as you protect your light,<br>
          know that wisdom is your right.</p>
        <p>Never stand still and always take to flight,<br>
          yours is enlightenment, the brightest of light.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Never has there been a night,<br>
          that was wasn&apos;t lit by light.</p>
        <p>Never has there been a fight,<br>
          that wasn&apos;t won by Wisdom&apos;s Might.</p>
        <p>Rise, rise in spite of the fright,<br>
          rise to no end in sight.</p>
