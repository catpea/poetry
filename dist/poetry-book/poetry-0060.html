        <p>My friends, as mighty as we are,<br>
          we can only do one thing at a time.</p>
        <p>Once you take care to choose the big things well,<br>
          the one thing before you...</p>
        <p>is what the big thing will depend on,<br>
          do it well.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Small things will sneak up on you,<br>
          and I am so sorry for that.</p>
        <p>It is the job of our Teachers to help us,<br>
          but today there are very few.</p>
        <p>You have to accept the responsibility,<br>
          you must fight for wisdom at all cost.</p>
        <p>In the absence of teachers,<br>
          you must become your teacher, it is your right.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>If you fail to educate yourself,<br>
          people will use you.</p>
        <p>They will use the best of you,<br>
          Your Generosity, Your Kindness, Your Might.</p>
        <p>They will pay you less,<br>
          and trick you to thank them that you still have the job.</p>
        <p>They will replace you with younger people,<br>
          come your Golden Age, to save a dollar.</p>
        <p>Come a tragedy,<br>
          they will use it to make you work harder.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>All of this is hard to see,<br>
          it brings so much relief and pleasure.</p>
        <p>It feels so right to choose,<br>
          but you are so much more than a worker.</p>
        <p>You must ask, if the path that you are on,<br>
          is worthy of the Magnificent Being you are.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>You are meant to become a Great Being,<br>
          you have to climb to see the Big Things.</p>
        <p>Even as a Great Being, my friends,<br>
          always look to the Big Things.</p>
        <p>Do not waste your precious time,<br>
          to achieve that which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozymandias">crumbles</a>.</p>
        <p>Look towards real things,<br>
          things that really last.</p>
