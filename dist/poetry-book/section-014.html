        <p>All those High and Mighty claims of<br>
          &quot;I am stronger&quot;, &quot;I can run longer&quot;, &quot;You can&apos;t do what I do&quot;, are bunk.</p>
        <p>But they also beautifully underline the importance of Endurance,<br>
          nothing is more important for an Athlete than Proper Endurance.</p>
        <p>Without a solid measure endurance,<br>
          we probably can&apos;t push out body into adaptation.</p>
        <p>In a way, will run out of the ability to go forward,<br>
          just before our body notices it needs to make some changes.</p>
        <p>Endurance may just be the very core of any and all Athletic pursuits,<br>
          including Bodybuilding, Gymnastics, and even Dancing.</p>
        <p>It is easiest to see that in Long Distance running,<br>
          in order to finish the race, we have to gradually increase our distance.</p>
        <p>It is very unhealthy to try to run an ultra-marathon,<br>
          without having first worked on our endurance.</p>
        <p>In bodybuilding lifting something 30 times may entertain a muscle,<br>
          but it is unlikely to influence it to develop to be better.</p>
        <p>Slowly gaining endurance to lift, three hundred times, three thousand times, and fifteen thousand times...<br>
          Will reliably encourage your body to adapt.</p>
        <p>Gradually increasing endurance, and eating a healthy and balanced diet,<br>
          will slowly send a signal to your body, that it must adapt.</p>
        <p>Endurance is the secret,<br>
          and <strong>gradually</strong> is the method of increasing it.</p>

        <p>Nonfiction books are way to share wisdom,<br>
          some wisdom is in the form of advice, other you have to discover yourself.</p>
        <p>Life is too precious, and we are far too intelligent not to inherit wisdom from books,<br>
          there is only one direction for us all, and that is towards Wisdom.</p>
        <p>Growing up,<br>
          enlarges our worlds.</p>
        <p>Wisdom, helps us see more roads in our Journeys,<br>
          roads that we would not have noticed without it.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>How can we be sure if we are traveling on the path that does us justice,<br>

        <p>We don&apos;t just inherit knowledge that leads to wisdom,<br>
          we also inherit culture, ways of thinking, and roads towards joy and happiness.</p>

        <p>Humanity celebrates those who rise,<br>
          it celebrates wisdom and the struggle for goodness.</p>

        <p>You know me, I am not one to complain,<br>
          but; every once in a while a little bird flies into my jogging lane.</p>
        <p>She lands, and turns her head to look at me,<br>
          the moment she sees that I see...</p>
        <p>...she starts hopping, moving <strong>much</strong> faster than me,<br>
          at first I thought she was trying to raise me as her baby.</p>
        <p>But now I think she&apos;s only doing this, to mock me,<br>
          she&apos;s just sick of seeing me struggle from her tree.</p>
        <p>For one, when she&apos;s done racing me,<br>
          she stops and just stares angrily.</p>
        <p>Then she always takes off for my face,<br>
          it is really hard to duck when you are trying to focus on your pace.</p>
        <p>I have a theory as to why she flies at me this way,<br>
          though I am afraid to say,</p>
        <p>Umm...</p>
        <p>Some of the flies that catch me when I leave my yard,<br>
          you know, those little ones that are always trying to lick so hard.</p>
        <p>Even after several miles... they kind of keep my pace,<br>
          kind of actually run circles around my face.</p>
        <p>While, I bring most of the flies back,<br>
          the bird probably flies at me like this, to grab a snack.</p>
        <p>Well,</p>
        <p>I am now trying really hard to improve my pace,<br>
          to get all those creatures out of my face.</p>
        <p>I run fast just as soon as I get out of my home.<br>
          maybe if I can outrun the flies the bird will leave me alone.</p>

        <p>Since we can&apos;t see future clearly,<br>
          the risk is simply too great not to take the higher more challenging roads.</p>
        <p>If we are mistaken about the importance of growing up,<br>
          and choose to push, and climb, and become Great Beings, anyway.</p>
        <p>Well, we can hardly say that we have fooled ourselves,<br>
          Becoming a Brilliant and Beautiful Being, is probably pretty hard to regret.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>But if we are mistaken about the importance of growing up,<br>
          and put opinion above fact, fantasy over reality, merely age and never grow.</p>
        <p>If we reject real education for grades, and GPA, and a photo op,<br>
          and a mere feeling of maturity, but also, fear and no motivation to continue.</p>
        <p>If we reach the age of retirement,<br>
          confused, or breakable, and lost.</p>
        <p>Then we will regret this,<br>
          surely.</p>
        <p>And although we won&apos;t know what might have been, we will have a feeling,<br>
          that Growing Up would have brought us clarity, unbreakability, and calm.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>The risk of misunderstanding the importance of Growing Up,<br>
          is too great, let us all aim to become Great Beings, My Friends.</p>
        <p>The Beauty of Beginnings,<br>
          it that they are always simple.</p>
        <p>There are very few unfamiliar things that play a role in rising,<br>
          after all, we only rise to become More Human, All Too Human.</p>
        <p>We are born with this ability,<br>
          it <em>has to be</em> within each and every one of us.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>It starts in childhood, as we venture to explore,<br>
          be it a garden, or some rusty machinery, or the alien worlds beyond the train tracks.</p>
        <p>And like interesting pebbles in a pocket, our observations add,<br>
          and as a whole stand to mean more.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Once our mind begins to flourish a decade later,<br>
          what we found of interest, or the things that created more questions, lead us to books.</p>
        <p>We discover that there were others there walking that path before us,<br>
          and what once was a twinkling star, becomes a Distant Sun, not unlike our Sun.</p>
        <p>And where once darkness was,<br>
          there is now a ray of light.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>And we must stay on this path, My Friends,<br>
          everyone will try to push you, claim to know better.</p>
        <p>Siblings, Parents, Teachers, Friends, your Boss,<br>
          they will have few motives, and little to explain.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>If you resist, or rise again, and find your way forward,<br>
          the Universe will continue adding to your Knowledge.</p>
        <p>You will slowly begin to become;<br>
          less what others need - and more of who you really are.</p>
        <p>Your knowledge will begin overflowing,<br>
          it will create a vast ocean.</p>
        <p>And then the waves will finally come,<br>
          churn, turn, tickle; help you up, and rest and relax, and feel safe.</p>
        <p>And that is the first plateau, the first step towards Your Greatness,<br>
          the finding of calm, and the successful resistance of what others want you to be.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>The waves will carry you,<br>
          but the ocean you swim in is your knowledge, is perfectly familiar, and friendly.</p>
        <p>And just reach out,<br>
          to what you will love next.</p>
        <p>And touch and remember,<br>
          and let the next plateau emerge.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Your plateaus, their order, and height and color, are not just a path to Greatness,<br>
          they are also your Beauty.</p>
        <p>Anybody can know what you know,<br>
          but only you will build your road to Greatness in that particular sequence and style.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>You may start with Mountainous Adventure, add Celestial Cartography,<br>
          followed by a venture into your own Photography Business.</p>
        <p>These are the waves of your own personal private school of life,<br>
          your ever expanding ocean, your Thriving Living Body of Knowledge.</p>
        <p>There is no one single direction here,<br>
          it is all directions all the time.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>So as long as you resist being pushed to places that are alien to you,<br>
          and carry on building Your Universe Within, you can only grow.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>More than what to think,<br>
          it is important to learn how to think.</p>
        <p>More than others pushing you around,<br>
          you must let your own ocean move you.</p>
        <p>No one can enact an external force on you,<br>
          that can ever be greater than the power that is already within you.</p>
        <p>Nothing external, or yet unfamiliar to you,<br>
          can move you as much as that which you Cherish, Admire and Love.</p>
        <p>Grow in the Sequence that Makes You a Force of Nature,<br>
          and at the familiar pace that your ocean expands at.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>To become a Great Being, to Grow All The Way Up,<br>
          is to become Perfectly Unbreakable out of all the Uncompressible treasure within you.</p>
        <p>Do not be sacred, for that which is in your power, becomes your power,<br>
          and that which is not - is not your fault.</p>
        <p>Rise,<br>
          My Friends.</p>

        <p>There cannot be jogging without acting crazy,<br>
          if you&apos;re not snarling and spitting you&apos;re just being lazy.</p>
        <p>Not to mention that its discussing to swallow those little files,<br>
          you&apos;re not supposed to <strong>keep</strong> them, they&apos;re not your prize.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, it makes no difference what race it may be,<br>
          manners go out the window, the moment you bend your knee.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Plus, nobody really runs to win the race,<br>
          we just set the correct pace and run to find our place in Space.</p>
        <p>The physical challenge is found in taking each step,<br>
          and not stopping until the last rep.</p>
        <p>But that&apos;s easy, it is the simplest thing about it all,<br>
          your body just gets used to it, and has a ball.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Jogging is mostly a little reminder that we are to turn our life to Art,<br>
          that we are to overcome our limits, and become super smart.</p>
        <p>The actual achievement is found in finishing what we start,<br>
          and the thousand other things we finish, by <em>subtle analogy</em> to this odd Art.</p>
        <p>In a word, we jog for our future selves,<br>
          so that they may become <strong>proud</strong> of themselves.</p>

          <strong>we</strong> must begin growing up, and inspire the children to growing up as well.</p>
        <p>Nothing will change, nothing can change,<br>
          unless we begin our lives by resuming where great beings left off.</p>
        <p>There is just one road for all to agree,<br>
          the road of Reality, Results, Knowledge, Wisdom, Excellence, and Good Ideas.</p>
        <p>We receive a very good impression of the meaning of Wisdom when we are children,<br>
          we think of Adults as all-knowing, as always correct, and perfect.</p>
        <p>This is our aim now, for in the absence of teachers we must become the teachers,<br>
          we must become the adults we wished we grew up with.</p>
        <p>This is how we make the World better,<br>
          for our generation, and moreso for the new generation, and all those yet to come.</p>
        <p>We can&apos;t hope for change,<br>
          and not grow to meet that demand ourselves.</p>
        <p>The change we need,<br>
          is driven by Permanent Inheritance of Culture of Wisdom for all generations to come.</p>
        <p>A Fine Culture, is self repairing, and it always heals,<br>
          it towers over forces of poverty, pain, bondage, fear, anger, hopelessness, shyness, and loneliness.</p>
        <p>And a fine culture is what we expect of the adults that we meet as children,<br>
          once we become this culture, and the children learn that it is real.</p>
        <p>The children will see it as an actual, realistic aim to grow into,<br>
          and they will enter a culture of beginning their lives, by resuming at the point where we leave off.</p>
        <p>In order for Humanity to Grow,<br>
          a Central Universal Culture of Knowledge, Wisdom, and Excellence, should emerge.</p>
        <p>A Central Meeting Point,<br>
          for all cultures that choose to leave bad ideas behind and converge on Wisdom and Peace.</p>

        <p>Your Earthly Lineage begun some four billions years ago,<br>
          you ancestors weren&apos;t human, they couldn&apos;t even breathe Oxygen.</p>
        <p>We gradually adapted to changing conditions,<br>
          to chemical composition of our Little Lonesome Blue Earth.</p>
        <p>In a mere Hundred Million years, we will be as different from who we are today,<br>
          as a Shrew is different from a Great Ape.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>But, one thing will never change,<br>
          and that is how special life that begun on Earth is.</p>
        <p>How colorful and unique our good ideas,<br>
          how different we must be from what life there may be out in space.</p>
        <p>And how incredibly close we all are,<br>
          we are such a tightly knit family, we share so much.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>And we can think without restrictions,<br>
          we don&apos;t have short memory, we don&apos;t lack imagination.</p>
        <p>Our ideas come from nowhere and everywhere,<br>
          we dream about anything and everything, here and everywhere.</p>
        <p>And we have poetry, and paintings, and doodles,<br>
          we have sculptures that are made out of stone and metal.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>And above all, we are all born a Royalty, and our proper posture,<br>
          is to rise to the challenge of becoming Philosopher Queens, and Philosopher Kings.</p>
        <p>Our consciousness, makes it so that we must rise to no end,<br>
          step after step, book after book, work of art, after a work of art.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Do not be scared,<br>
          Above All, Love Yourself.</p>
        <p>Humanity is in a process of amassing Culture,<br>
          whether we notice it or not, <strong>it is</strong> abandoning bad ideas.</p>
        <p>And, You Are Born A Royalty,<br>
          And Your aim, is to become Philosopher Queens, and Kings.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Say it with me:<br>
          Forbearance, Hardihood, Largesse, Benevolence, and Honour.</p>
        <p>Restraint, Dignity, Nobility, Unbreakability, Fortitude, Courage,<br>
          Love; and Insight; and Foresight; and Understanding; and Authenticity; and Heroism;</p>
        <p>And Celebrate<br>
          Your Beautiful Life.</p>
