        <p>Our minds constantly construct boundaries,<br>
          and constantly try to make us comfortable.</p>
        <p>But in an evolved world this works against us,<br>
          it creates boundaries across which we hope to discharge pain.</p>
        <p>The source of the pain is poverty, poverty of mind and wallet,<br>
          fear, pain, unfairness and inequality, add to the blindness.</p>
        <p>There is no solution on the level where poverty reins,<br>
          it will always be walls turning people against each other.</p>
        <p>We are not ready for the next level,<br>
          in the next level we recognize poverty as a virus.</p>
        <p>We see it as a Natural Disaster,<br>
          we sit back, relax, calm down, print enough money to end it and move on.</p>
        <p>This does not mean everyone is going to be rich,<br>
          it only means, nobody will be stuck in financial poverty.</p>
        <p>Poverty of mind, the other half of poverty is not even up for discussion,<br>
          not until everyone has a safe home.</p>
        <p>All of this seems impossible, to many laughable,<br>
          irrational, infantile, unfair even.</p>
        <p>For those of you who don&apos;t understand how someone could possibly call this unfair,<br>
          some will angrily yell &quot;Why should someone get a free home, when I worked for mine, my entire life?&quot;.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>This is the Nature of the Walls,<br>
          the picture of the great divide.</p>
        <p>A divide between who we are today,<br>
          and who we should be tomorrow.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>A Human Being is so special,<br>
          that they may not exist without their own Home, not just a house.</p>
        <p>So special, that active countermeasures must be put in place,<br>
          to help people move away from bad ideas.</p>
        <p>A Human Being is so special, that they must never grow up in fear,<br>
          that they must never be lied to, never manipulated.</p>
        <p>They must never be pressured, never become stressed or depressed,<br>
          minds are delicate and must be protected.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>We can&apos;t see that, because the walls are invisible,<br>
          we often can&apos;t see that with which we grow up with.</p>
        <p>Emboldened we dare to hold up our opinion,<br>
          as if it was on par with a Great Being&apos;s carefully observed fact, or wisdom.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Crushed, stressed, pressured, tired,<br>
          we temporarily lose our mind.</p>
        <p>The thing that makes Humans Special,<br>
          can be turned off by tiredness and stress.</p>
        <p>And our brains go into Stupid Mode,<br>
          A versus B, A lesser/better B.</p>
        <p>And it seems like we are still operating,<br>
          but that&apos;s just an illusion, that not us, at all.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>I don&apos;t know how long it will take us to see how special we are,<br>
          how many gaps need to be crossed, or how many upgrades our Cultures need.</p>
        <p>I know that divided, the generations will always fight across pointless walls,<br>
          and I know that without unity, the world will not progress.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>The children are watching,<br>
          they are always watching.</p>
        <p>They will emulate what they see,<br>
          they will accept it as reality.</p>
        <p>They will add to the invisible walls,<br>
          and dismiss others to discharge pain, or stress.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>We can&apos;t have a discussion about any of this,<br>
          until stress of poverty is out of the picture.</p>
        <p>It will be one of the Humanity&apos;s greatest achievements,<br>
          to help everyone wake up to a home, with enough food, and a world that cares.</p>
        <p>Until that moment comes,<br>
          we can&apos;t have a conversation with all.</p>
        <p>Whether we are ready to know it, or not,<br>
          the way the world grows... it&apos;s either all of us, on none.</p>
