        <p>Don&apos;t take shortcuts,<br>
          all shortcuts end abruptly.</p>
        <p>You can&apos;t pretend,<br>
          what you pretend, can&apos;t ever become real.</p>
        <p>A life without Authenticity,<br>
          will forever feel like chaos.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>You have no choice, but to Rise,<br>
          to Emerge, in Majestic Authenticity.</p>
        <p>To build and reinforce your Content of Character,<br>
          to pursue Wisdom and Excellence.</p>
        <p>To Be You.<br>
          To Feel Meaning.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Growing Up has always been a Great Challenge.<br>
          it has never been easy.</p>
        <p>Growing Up is the first, and foremost, and most important,<br>
          and should life crumble, you will rebuild.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Don&apos;t worry, you are not wasting time Growing Up,<br>
          it matters not how you step forward, just that you do.</p>
        <p>The result is the same, Content of Character, Strength,<br>
          Joy, Love, Happiness, Adventure, and Foolishness,<br>
          to name a few.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Not only is this the only way to live,<br>
          but it is also the only way for the World to Learn.</p>
        <p>Humans cannot be led outside in,<br>
          they must be taught to lead, inside out.</p>
