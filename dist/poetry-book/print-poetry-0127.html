        <p>When you sense that fear is near,<br>
          begin thinking about all the things you hold dear.</p>
        <p>Think about how far you have already grown,<br>
          how much of what you love used to be scary or unknown.</p>
        <p>And do not let anyone try to control you with fear,<br>
          they are weak and their mind is already broken and unclear.</p><br>
        <p>Above all, know the weakness of fear,<br>
          all the things in your soul are far more real.</p><br>
        <p>But do not just close your eyes and let it pass,<br>
          turn inward to remember your beauty, strength and class.</p>
        <p>Let each time you get scared,<br>
          mark a day where you contemplate.</p>
        <p>Think about all the little wisdoms you love,<br>
          and how much more you learned by standing up when push came to shove.</p>
