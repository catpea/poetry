        <p>Take two steps forward,<br>
          and one step back, Jack.</p>
        <p>Jogging is an art,<br>
          and for art you must be smart.</p>
        <p>For each two days of training,<br>
          on the third you must pretend it&apos;s raining.</p>
        <p>If you you can&apos;t make it rain,<br>
          always worrying about your gain;</p>
        <p>then walking is just fine,<br>
          But, never cross that little line.</p>
        <p>The third day is a day of rest,<br>
          and the fourth your next test.</p>
        <p>Because, you always have to go back,<br>
          and start anew to lay down your track.</p>

        <p>Don&apos;t take shortcuts,<br>
          all shortcuts end abruptly.</p>
        <p>You can&apos;t pretend,<br>
          what you pretend, can&apos;t ever become real.</p>
        <p>A life without Authenticity,<br>
          will forever feel like chaos.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>You have no choice, but to Rise,<br>
          to Emerge, in Majestic Authenticity.</p>
        <p>To build and reinforce your Content of Character,<br>

        <p>Growing Up has always been a Great Challenge.<br>
          it has never been easy.</p>
        <p>Growing Up is the first, and foremost, and most important,<br>
          and should life crumble, you will rebuild.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Don&apos;t worry, you are not wasting time Growing Up,<br>
          it matters not how you step forward, just that you do.</p>
        <p>The result is the same, Content of Character, Strength,<br>
          Joy, Love, Happiness, Adventure, and Foolishness,<br>
          to name a few.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Not only is this the only way to live,<br>
          but it is also the only way for the World to Learn.</p>
        <p>Humans cannot be led outside in,<br>
          they must be taught to lead, inside out.</p>
        <p>The recipe for your own Growing Up,<br>
          is also the recipe for a Wise World.</p>

        <p>Your light must be a true reflection of Yourself,<br>
          so that You may be truly seen and understood.</p>
        <p>Do not hide, emulate, simulate, pretend, or serve;<br>
          that only disrupts Your light and path.</p>
        <p>You are already special enough,<br>
          You are a Child of The Universe.</p>
        <p>You are meant to become a Great Being through your own journey,<br>
          You are meant to bring enlightenment, unseen before.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Please, take good care of Yourself,<br>
          You are responsible for Your delicate mind and body.</p>
        <p>And take care of Your Elder Self,<br>
          so that You may have no regrets come Your Golden Age.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Your Existence, requires that You walk Your own path,<br>
          that You lead Your own way.</p>
        <p>But the path is not a straight line,<br>
          it is more of a flat spiral, you are never far from yourself.</p>
        <p>There is so much of You in Your Elder Self,<br>
          and there is so much of Your Elder self in You already.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Be good to Her, love Yourself,<br>
          be mighty, and authentic.</p>
        <p>Never let Yourself down, always rise,<br>
          and do not slow down.</p>
        <p>Step after step jog mightily forward,<br>
          decorate Your Beautiful Journey with Wisdom and Triumph.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>May Your elder self, perch upon a porch,<br>
          and muse and wonder...</p>
        <p>&quot;What a strange Star Child I was,<br>
          and how impossibly long my Beautiful Life&quot;</p>
        <p>And may You bring Her memories,<br>
          of every year in each decade.</p>
        <p>Of things You noticed for the first time,<br>
          and things You never knew could happen.</p>
        <p>And things, that other people never expected of You,<br>
          like that year, that you wore a bushy tail - because it made you feel beautiful.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Love Your older self,<br>
          make Her smile and wonder.</p>
        <p>Make Her love the Younger You,<br>
          but fill in all the years completely.</p>
        <p>Make sure, that not only is there nothing new to add,<br>
          but also that there is nowhere anything could fit.</p>

        <p>We have an aversion to being trapped,<br>
          because of an innate sense of distance that we must travel.</p>
        <p>The distance begins the moment we gain self-awareness,<br>
          the end, does not matter - only the distance does.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>You are in charge of the direction of your journey,<br>
          if you let it lead you, it will pull you in all directions.</p>
        <p>In letting the life dictate,<br>
          you will become divided.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>In doing the dictating,<br>
          you, will set the aim.</p>
        <p>If you let yourself become a leader,<br>
          you will arrive at a singe destination.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>In one way, or another,<br>
          you will, without a doubt, arrive.</p>
        <p>The Universe, cannot stop what you start,<br>
          the Universe will gently let your existence expand.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>It is tough to be led and expect clarity,<br>
          there will be too much noise from following.</p>
        <p>But in leading, there is no noise,<br>
          the path is pure, as pure as your imagination.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>The steps along your journey,<br>
          extract a price.</p>
        <p>The Universe smiles,<br>
          as you pay your way.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>You start as a child,<br>
          and the first step is very difficult.</p>
        <p>And the second, and fourth grade,<br>
          and sixth semester, and eighth book.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Your singular ripple,<br>
          unlike everything else out in the Universe;</p>
        <p>Has a breathtaking order dictated from within,<br>
          not pushed by the chaos, but dictated by your mind.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Can you imagine how boring chaos becomes,<br>
          and can you see how beautiful your perfect ripple.</p>
        <p>The edge of chaos that surrounds your beauty,<br>
          is pushed out by a kind, of Youniverse.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Let me be clear,<br>
          you are not a river, nor a snowball, or a butterfly&apos;s wing.</p>
        <p>There is enough of those, already,<br>
          nothing worthy of you, needs you to follow.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>It is a Law of The Universe,<br>
          that no Human should follow.</p>
        <p>A river should flows surely to the sea,<br>
          but a Human, is meant to Lead.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>It is a simple but forgotten lesson,<br>
          it is meant to sit next to; Love of Wisdom.</p>
        <p>That no human should serve nor follow,<br>
          non should practice resignation.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>If you feel weak,<br>
          it is because you resigned for too long.</p>
        <p>And you will have to start in the beginning,<br>

        <p>Your superpowers are not rooted in your wishes,<br>
          as only very few wishes come true.</p>
        <p>Universe has already established its rule and order,<br>
          we are latecomers to the Symphony Orchestra.</p>
        <p>Instead, seek your superpowers in what you already own,<br>
          in the things that have already sprung.</p>
        <p>In the incredible adaptability of your body,<br>
          in your raw, unleashed consciousness.</p>
        <p>If you are good to your body, you body will flourish,<br>
          it is a biological system, not that different from a flower.</p>
        <p>If you are good to your mind, it will expand,<br>
          it is a navigational system with landmarks.</p>
        <p>Your mind is especially beautiful,<br>
          it has a large memory capacity.</p>
        <p>You can&apos;t recall letters on a particular page in a book,<br>
          but you can recall the walls in your home, the streets in your city.</p>
        <p>Your mind does not differentiate between navigating a road,<br>
          or a vast galaxy of star constellations.</p>
        <p>Your mind can encode interconnected knowledge,<br>
          so as long as it is marked with pictures and relative locations on a well connected tree.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>It is foolish to think to a particular page,<br>
          and feel ordinary for not being able to recall all the words.</p>
        <p>It is foolish to try to ride a boat,<br>
          on a road.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Do not seek to invent your superpowers,<br>
          instead, recognize the ones you already have - and expand them.</p>

        <p>Your Lifeline - the cumulative choices you made that affected your entire life,<br>
          must be precisely aligned to match who you are, so that you may learn.</p>
        <p>This is not an easy thing,<br>
          but there can be no other.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>We live in a world under constant erosion from Poverty,<br>
          Authenticity is a difficult path.</p>
        <p>Stay safe, love yourself,
          but you must also stand your ground.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>What life is pressing you into,<br>
          and the path that you must be on for your wisdom sake;</p>
        <p>Are likely to be some distance apart,<br>
          this is the tragedy of our modern age.</p>
        <p>The complexity of life, will be pushing you away,<br>
          from the line you need to walk to learn and become wise.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>The path that life is trying to press you into,<br>
          is almost truly random, it comes out of misery and chance.</p>
        <p>The path mere life dictates includes lies and manipulations that you can&apos;t see at first,<br>
          people will use your innocence against you, to make their lives simpler.</p>
        <p>When you follow, you fall into cogs of ravenous emergent machinery,<br>
          and this machinery exists, because, followers gather.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>My Dear Friends, if you must,<br>
          then know that there is but one you serve.</p>
        <p>The Wisest You, The Best You, The Most Brilliant You,<br>
          at the Greatest Age of Your Life, Your Golden Age of Wisdom.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>The path that mere life dictates, is a melody out of tune,<br>
          you become a piano key, and life will keep pushing, non-stop.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>But the path you dictate, is very unusual in deed,<br>
          because each step you take, adds to the previous.</p>
        <p>And with only a few steps,<br>
          you are stepping higher, you are already building, up.</p>
        <p>That is the same &quot;up&quot;, that &quot;Grow Up&quot; uses,<br>
          your own step, followed by you own step, forward and up.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>If you dare to throw caution into the wind,<br>
          it will bring you wisdom - you&apos;ll see.</p>
        <p>But other than that, like a cat,<br>
          walk cautiously onward.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>When things start adding up,<br>
          you will surpass your younger self.</p>
        <p>And now, where you used to think: &quot;And where am I actually going?&quot;,<br>
          you will see a road ahead, by subtle analogy to the road you&apos;ve already traveled.</p>
        <p>Where once you toyed with the question of &quot;Who am I?&quot;,<br>
          you will now, see you.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>You&apos;ll make little mistakes, and that is OK,<br>
          because you will have your path to fall back on.</p>
        <p>And those mistaken tangents, will cradle you,<br>
          they will add, and refine your decision-making.</p>
        <p>When you walk your own path,<br>
          you do not make big mistakes.</p>
        <p>The little ones will teach about the bigger ones,<br>
          by subtle analogy.</p>
        <p>Your own path,<br>
          is a great teacher.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>So what is it like,<br>
          on that path?</p>
        <p>I am very sorry to say, it is lonely,<br>
          but loneliness is correct.</p>
        <p>Not until you find your other half,<br>
          will loneliness let go of you.</p>
        <p>It is there to remind you,<br>
          that you can only make it half-way on your own.</p>
        <p>Your own path,<br>
          is above all; clear.</p>
        <p>There are no excuses,<br>
          nothing to sway you.</p>
        <p>The air is crisp,<br>
          there is no smog.</p>
        <p>Just,<br>
          a clear vision.</p>
        <p>Even without any guarantees in life,<br>
          you will become stronger.</p>
        <p>But, yes - no matter how beautiful you become,<br>
          Universe will do nothing to guarantee you, anything.</p>
        <p>This,<br>
          is the Leap of Faith.</p>
        <p>And the faith,<br>
          is in Your Greater Self.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Walk your own path, because in the first half of your life,<br>
          your own path is the only thing that can add to you.</p>
        <p>Authenticity, is a law of the Universe,<br>
          it follows similar principles.</p>
        <p>Walk your own path,<br>
          and expand.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>The first steps are always clumsy,<br>
          I went to the museums.</p>
        <p>A coffee shop is a bad idea,<br>
          because everyone is there.</p>
        <p>But a museum is different,<br>
          it filters for kindness, somehow.</p>
        <p>I went to the D.I.A<br>
          I was extremely lucky.</p>
        <p>They were showing,
          Auguste Rodin&apos;s work.</p>
        <p>I understood it immediately, the secret of sculpture,<br>
          is to enlarge that part that holds the soul.</p>
        <p>At the end,<br>
          they had The Waltz (possibly a large replica as it had more detail, this was some 13 years ago), that dancing couple by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camille_Claudel">Camille Claudel</a>.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0088-lavalse.jpg" alt="The Waltz"></p>
        <p>I started crying,<br>
          her hand, had so much feeling in that gentle arch, there was so much touch.</p>
        <p>That is life,<br>
          that is the path.</p>
        <p>The path, where you cry out of beauty,<br>
          and not cry out of being lost.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>And you have to create art,<br>
          art is about training yourself for success.</p>
        <p>Learning,
          by subtle analogy.</p>
        <p>That&apos;s why you never finish,<br>
          there is no time for the art it self.</p>
        <p>There is only time,<br>
          for learning life.</p>
        <p>Learning by subtle analogy,<br>
          to the smaller Triumph, and Success.</p>
        <p>Stick to a single subject,<br>
          until you fill it completely.</p>
        <p>Now you can hang it up at the coffee shop,<br>
          but keep moving forward.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Do not Follow, My Friends,<br>
          there is nothing there to be found.</p>
        <p>Nothing you find when you follow,<br>
          will add together to make a whole.</p>
        <p>When it feels like you are surrounded by paths,<br>
          and there is nowhere to go, or you can&apos;t go into enough places.</p>
        <p>That is an illusion,<br>
          all those paths are false.</p>
        <p>Turn around,<br>
          slow down.</p>
        <p>Go back to the last thing that <em>moved</em> you,<br>
          and fearlessly resume at that point.</p>
        <p>The world may shake and shudder,<br>
          and there will be &quot;Why?&quot;, and &quot;How could you?&quot;, and &quot;What is going on?&quot;.</p>
        <p>All those cries,<br>
          are for the person that follows.</p>
        <p>Each asking you to a different path,
          and all those paths are mutually incompatible.</p>
        <p>Do you see,<br>
          life wants you to merely be.</p>
        <p>But you <em>can</em> be more,<br>
          you don&apos;t have to call it Growing Up, Courage, Authenticity or Growing Content of Character.</p>
        <p>Call it, and appointment at D.I.A.<br>
          call it, a meeting at the UofM Museum of Natural History.</p>
        <p>Begin keeping a Moleskine Journal,<br>
          use a pencil,<br>
          only draw what your heart sees,<br>
          and write as little as possible,<br>
          write to your older self,<br>
          explain to her why?</p>
        <p>Find your center,<br>
          find your balance.</p>
        <p>Lean on your Nucleus,<br>
          and push off to take your steps in your own direction.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Calm your hand,<br>
          slow your time.</p>
        <p>There are decades ahead,<br>
          and you have to be seen.</p>
        <p>Show yourself,<br>
          create future.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>What others have, may shine,<br>
          but is not always gold they keep.</p>
        <p>The younger we are,<br>
          the less wisdom we hold;</p>
        <p>The less wisdom,<br>
          the more questions we should answer.</p>
        <p>And questions combined with life,<br>
          make for a busy time in deed.</p>
        <p>So slow down,<br>
          answer your questions - first.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>All life is sacred,<br>
          all Lifelines equally matter.</p>
        <p>But not all will arrive at their Golden Age of Wisdom,<br>
          without regrets.</p>
        <p>So, please,<br>
          ask your older self what her regrets are.</p>
        <p>And the higher you grow, the more you know, and which is more,<br>
          the more in harmony with your older-self, you&apos;ll be.</p>

        <p>Waiting for the sun to inch down,<br>
          before I go out in the town.</p>
        <p>My legs have become like two huge potatoes,<br>
          but that&apos;s life, that&apos;s how it goes.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>There are so many lovely people that notice me out there,<br>
          yesterday a cute couple, lady with fancy hair.</p>
        <p>A couple of days ago, a gent from the gym,<br>
          slowly walking and wondering &quot;Is that him?&quot;</p>
        <p>Oh yeah, that was me! I shaved my mustache,<br>
          and taught my self to dash.</p>
        <p>Sure I run at the speed of a sickly gastropod,<br>
          but after my gym-dancing, don&apos;t even feel odd.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>And before that, the ladies in the Jeep,<br>
          I didn&apos;t wave back, I am sorry, I was in the middle of a huge leap.</p>
        <p>And then the first person to notice me in my sluggish swim,<br>
          might have been the Trainer! from the gym.</p>
        <p>I was really tired in the middle of my early run,<br>
          muttering &quot;I can&apos;t believe I have to run the same distance, before I am done.&quot;</p>
        <p>And then I heard &quot;Hi! Andre!&quot; and I instantly regained my strength,<br>
          I could have run five times that length.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Sure, I am still learning, running tests and trails,<br>
          but my aim is one hour, to do the whole five miles.</p>
        <p>And you know what, just after two weeks,<br>
          I run a lot faster; and I have rosy cheeks!</p>
