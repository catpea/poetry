        <p>We are too good, at working too hard,<br>
          this is why we must stay on guard.</p>
        <p>Your mind is more than just a tool,<br>
          it is a rare and beautiful jewel.</p>
        <p>Many hope that you will never know,<br>
          that your generation is the new new hope, for the world to grow.</p>
        <p>But, if we just close our eyes and let mistakes repeat,<br>
          the world will fade away in silent defeat.</p>
        <p>Go, take to adventure, pack, and get into you car,<br>
          so that you will never forget who you really are.</p>
