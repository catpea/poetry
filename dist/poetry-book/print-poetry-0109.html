        <p>Your Earthly Lineage begun some four billions years ago,<br>
          you ancestors weren&apos;t human, they couldn&apos;t even breathe Oxygen.</p>
        <p>We gradually adapted to changing conditions,<br>
          to chemical composition of our Little Lonesome Blue Earth.</p>
        <p>In a mere Hundred Million years, we will be as different from who we are today,<br>
          as a Shrew is different from a Great Ape.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>But, one thing will never change,<br>
          and that is how special life that begun on Earth is.</p>
        <p>How colorful and unique our good ideas,<br>
          how different we must be from what life there may be out in space.</p>
        <p>And how incredibly close we all are,<br>
          we are such a tightly knit family, we share so much.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>And we can think without restrictions,<br>
          we don&apos;t have short memory, we don&apos;t lack imagination.</p>
        <p>Our ideas come from nowhere and everywhere,<br>
          we dream about anything and everything, here and everywhere.</p>
        <p>And we have poetry, and paintings, and doodles,<br>
          we have sculptures that are made out of stone and metal.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>And above all, we are all born a Royalty, and our proper posture,<br>
          is to rise to the challenge of becoming Philosopher Queens, and Philosopher Kings.</p>
        <p>Our consciousness, makes it so that we must rise to no end,<br>
          step after step, book after book, work of art, after a work of art.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Do not be scared,<br>
          Above All, Love Yourself.</p>
        <p>Humanity is in a process of amassing Culture,<br>
          whether we notice it or not, <strong>it is</strong> abandoning bad ideas.</p>
        <p>And, You Are Born A Royalty,<br>
          And Your aim, is to become Philosopher Queens, and Kings.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Say it with me:<br>
          Forbearance, Hardihood, Largesse, Benevolence, and Honour.</p>
        <p>Restraint, Dignity, Nobility, Unbreakability, Fortitude, Courage,<br>
          Love; and Insight; and Foresight; and Understanding; and Authenticity; and Heroism;</p>
        <p>And Celebrate<br>
          Your Beautiful Life.</p>
