        <p>While Constitutions and Declarations,<br>
          age and get amended, to become other than intended.</p>
        <p>Most beloved poetry is writ in stone,<br>
          loved and celebrated, and hard to forget.</p>
        <p>So, let us write poems to celebrate every era,<br>
          and each new idea worthy of us and the modern times.</p>
        <p>Humanity has always faced great challenges,<br>
          and the greatest challenges moved us the most.</p>
        <p>Today, we must fix Education for all,<br>
          and it <strong>has to</strong> result in creating Wise Great Minds.</p>
        <p>We have to fix World Poverty,<br>
          as it too often destroys minds before they can even put up a fight.</p>
        <p>And we have to create a clearer picture of the world,<br>
          poems that reveal problems before they come into being.</p>
        <p>Above all we have to help Young People,<br>
          help them to understand the world better.</p>
        <p>Help them gain early insight,<br>
          so that they are not easily manipulated.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>At the very least,<br>
          we have to explain;</p>
        <p>How borders divide,<br>
          and how divided, we are made to fight.</p>
        <p>How easy it is to dress ignorance in authority,<br>
          how some principals, or teachers, or parents, never cared, and never will.</p>
        <p>How poverty is not the fault of the children born into it,<br>
          but a mark of broken and immature and selfish politics.</p>
        <p>How talent, and genius, and genes are a stupid myth for poor angry little men,<br>
          how self education is far more meaningful, and how and noble.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>You, my Dear Readers,<br>
          You are <strong>full</strong> of Great Ideas.</p>
        <p>The things you wish you knew when you were younger,<br>
          are more important than you think.</p>
        <p>Those are the ideas that will create<br>
          unforgettable poetry.</p>
        <p>Please, pick up a pencil, pick up a keyboard,<br>
          and rhyme or arrange, impress with words, with inspirational letters.</p>
        <p>The ideas you hold dear,<br>
          make you a philosopher, a poet, and artist.</p>
        <p>The ideas you hold dear make you a teacher,<br>
          Please, help the world learn.</p>
