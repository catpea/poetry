        <p>We must make time, to enlarge our view,<br>
          and in everything we do, we must first think things through.</p>
        <p>Above all, to thine own self be true,<br>
          but also your own world, should fit like a good shoe.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>With each step you took your mind grew,<br>
          with all new things, we never really start anew.</p>
        <p>Where ever we go, whatever we go through,<br>
          we learn and our wisdom evolves, as we continue.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Sure, sometimes it feels like we don&apos;t know what to do,<br>
          but when you get sad, the whole Universe becomes slightly more blue,</p>
        <p>We may not know exactly what you are going through,<br>
          but many of us have been there, we too got stuck until we grew.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Many great beings get hurt, but all plow on through,<br>
          you are not alone, in our own thoughts, we sit right next to you.</p>
        <p>Please push trough the pain, and look through the zoo,<br>
          when all is writ, and said and done, we all still need you,</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>There is a blinding beauty to who you already are - I wish you knew,<br>
          with each step forward, you become a brighter star, and we love you.</p>
        <p>Don&apos;t worry, so as long as to your own self you stay true,<br>
          it will all pass, and when looking back you&apos;ll say - &quot;I Grew.&quot;</p>

        <p>Like steps on a mountain, each epoch stands in support of the next,<br>
          like the pages of a journal, together, they hold the sacred text.</p>
        <p>We learn, we may fail, or triumph, and the next epoch follows,<br>
          but every new epoch grows from the one previous.</p>
        <p>We can&apos;t leap from one place to another,<br>
          we can only move up, or graduate up, or build up, or step up.</p>
        <p>To leap, is to stay a child in an aging body,<br>
          to go up, to grow up, and carry on to no end, is to become an adult.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>In our youth we must learn to stand our ground,<br>
          and anchor ourselves to something that moves us.</p>
        <p>As we age, having followed that path,<br>
          we&apos;ll be standing upon our own mountain,</p>
        <p>A great mountain of personal wisdom,<br>
          where once only a direction lay.</p>
        <p>These mountains rise with each epoch in our life,<br>
          every once in a while we pause, to bring all that we are together - higher.</p>
        <p>Epoch by Epoch, we ascend, we can already see the sunshine,<br>
          but our journey comes with no end.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>This is a simple life, first we conform and then break away,<br>
          we become wise, and later in life, our wisdom transforms into Enlightenment.</p>
        <p>It is a road of Adventures, Books, Poems, and Inspirations,<br>
          it has tears of sadness, but in return we grow stronger.</p>
        <p>What it is all for, is to Live a Life of Simple Dignity,<br>
          or rising when we fall, of learning when we get tricked.</p>
        <p>Of protecting our bodies and minds, and growing stronger,<br>
          of adding to our existing body of wisdom.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>With each epoch we climb over what we previously thought were our limits,<br>
          As we get up, and stand up, we reach a new plateau.</p>
        <p>We rest, we take in the sun of this new height,<br>
          and get busy building higher, and higher.</p>
        <p>None of us begged to be born, we were nothingness,<br>
          and temporarily all these atoms came together to give us, ourselves.</p>
        <p>And eventually, we&apos;ll return to our nothingness,<br>
          and the atoms will disperse, to become parts of other beautiful things,</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>While we are in this state, however, the first and foremost order!<br>
          ...is to Thrive, to Grow, to Expand, to Rise, to Build, and to Ascend.</p>
        <p>Whether we know it yet or not, the road that we are on, is one.<br>
          It is the same road that our 90 year old selves will wonder about.</p>
        <p>They will go up and down the Epochs, and ask questions.<br>
          there will be some regrets, but we do have a chance to solve them now.</p>
        <p>There will be enough triumph to bring blinding light to all the sadness,<br>
          and the beautiful memories will wipe out all the unimportant things.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>All that stands in the way of our growing up,<br>
          must be pushed aside, growing up is our life.</p>
        <p>We must grow up, rise up, all the way up.<br>
          Each and every epoch ahead, demands this.</p>
        <p>Our minds require wisdom, wisdom fuels our decision making,<br>
          and our choices dictate all our life ahead.</p>
        <p>Life is precious, it is to be lived in Dignity and Authenticity,<br>
          and you are meant to become a Great Being.</p>

        <p>Wherever I went, Friday magically followed,<br>
          there always seem to have been a tree that was hollowed,</p>
        <p>And the moment I looked at food,<br>
          he knew, dinner was going to be good.</p>
        <p>Wherever the Raccoons came out at night,<br>
          Friday, was always there, my Fat Spirit Guide.</p>
        <p>Over at Little Torch Key, at Veterans Beach, with easy access to water,<br>
          he lived up a Palm Tree, with his Furry Wife and Tiny Daughter,</p>
        <p>Once I got lonely, and threw a little Tortilla all the way up there,<br>
          he popped up, and it looked like he smiled - I swear.</p>
        <p>Over at Ludington State Park, at the Jack Pine Hike-in Campground,<br>
          I woke up at 3 am, hearing a strange sound.</p>
        <p>He was trying to pull out my hamburger buns,<br>
          probably to feed all his furry sons.</p>
        <p>The bag was tied, up in a tree,<br>
          nothing could stop him - Because he was free.</p>
        <p>I got out of my tent, and delivered his late night bite,<br>
          by tossing it into my cranky neighbor&apos;s camp site.</p>
        <p>The whole woodland family, knew that eventually I had to go back,<br>
          Friday left a little footprint on my pillow, to help me pack.</p>
        <p>I was staying up in the trees, on top of ancient dunes,<br>
          the only light was that of stars, and the moon&apos;s.</p>
        <p>I called them <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/wsX31CTTXR4bzhza8">Nordhouse Skylands</a>,<br>
          but, if you go out there, be ready for his smart little hands,</p>
        <p>Bring a travel lock to secure the zippers on your tent,<br>
          and remember, Friday loves you as friend, he means no ill intent.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0070-nurnberg.jpg" alt="Nurnberg"></p>
        <p>My Dear Readers, we may each need a few weeks of Wilderness in our life,<br>
          so start slowly packing, buy a backpack, bug spray, and a knife,</p>
        <p>And just keep your adventure pack by the door,<br>
          if life ever gets you down, smile! and head for that Lake Michigan shore.</p>
        <p>You can park at the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/PhyA8hEuiAZnBmt1A">Nurnberg Trailhead</a>,<br>
          and don&apos;t forget to bring a little bit of stinky cheese,<br>
          and piece of stale bread.</p>

        <p>Some adventurers,<br>
          wrestle bears.</p>
        <p>Others,<br>
          runaway from their fathers.</p>
        <p>I,<br>
          bemoan the lack of Wi-Fi.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>That is, until the night comes about,<br>
          at which point all the wild creatures come out.</p>
        <p>I&apos;ve heard stories of owls swooping down from the air,<br>
          just to rip out whatever is left of a man&apos;s hair.</p>
        <p>Then there are the occasional mad deer,<br>
          always shimmy-shammying around like they had a beer.</p>
        <p>The coyotes are especially frightening,<br>
          they come in groups, flashing their eyes like lightening.</p>
        <p>One time I tried to turn on a flashlight,<br>
          as it turned out - to all the big spider&apos;s delight.</p>
        <p>Let me tell ya, It takes a man with a lot of brass,<br>
          not to scream, when a spider crawls out with a huge glowing ass.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Once, an older lady from a near by camp went to get more booze from her car,<br>
          and then misjudged her distance, and walked back too far.</p>
        <p>I was sleeping on the ground in my tiny tent,<br>
          and then all of a sudden she started yelling out in her lost torment.</p>
        <p>Of course, in the middle of the night, and woods and my sleep,<br>
          she didn&apos;t sound like a lady but rather some huge creepy creep.</p>
        <p>She found her way back, and I am sure they partied hard,<br>
          but not knowing what made all those screams, I slept - on guard.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Porcupines, oh, you&apos;ve never seen one like I did,<br>
          it was huge, covered in spikes, and really fit.</p>
        <p>It could outrun a car or two,<br>
          probably, bite a tire and chew.</p>
        <p>But then I came across a sign,<br>
          and it turned out that the biggest creature, was not the Porcupine,</p>
        <p>I was always pretty happy that none of the creatures that bite,<br>
          could actually take me down in a single swipe.</p>
        <p>But the sign read, <strong>Beware Of Bear</strong><br>
          and that to me was the biggest scare.</p>

        <p>I like riding around on my bicycle,<br>
          but today I felt like an icicle.</p>
        <p>Just got back from this years first long ride,<br>
          I feel cheerful and mighty satisfied.</p>
        <p>All the cute creatures are still there,<br>
          and thankfully, still no signs of angry bear.</p>
        <p>Riding alone, I reminisced about a warmer time,<br>
          when a car slowed down and screamed like there was some crime.</p>
        <p>I had no idea what they were saying,<br>
          but waiving their hands, it was a danger they were portraying.</p>
        <p>But, I was like, &quot;Oh, whopped do, who knows...&quot;<br>
          and in the next moment, I had to take off most of my clothes.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0068-noclothes.jpg" alt="No Clothes"></p>
        <p>I have never been in such great rain,<br>
          it was like standing next to a burst water main.</p>
        <p>I loved it, the rain was fragrant, fresh and warm,<br>
          I could never call that a storm.</p>
        <p>The sun came out instantly, I was like &quot;K. rain, thanks, bye.&quot;,<br>
          and then I had to hang out all my clothes to dry.</p>
        <p>The 13 mile ride back home was full of mud,<br>
          I had to lift my legs, and will my bike across a flood.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0068-mud.jpg" alt="Mud"></p>
        <p>I am so glad no one will ever know about this,<br>
          but still, these are the memorable moments
          that make me reminisce.</p>

        <p>You can leave, you don&apos;t have to ask the Teacher,<br>
          if they are not teaching you, they can only delay your education.</p>
        <p>If school is wasting your time, teaching you nothing,<br>
          That is a crime, and if you stay; your foreshadowing.</p>
        <p>We have something now, my Dear Friend.<br>
          We have Internet Lectures, Audio Books, and Start-up Incubators.</p>
        <p>No teacher can teach you better than failing at your first start-up,<br>
          no teacher can bring you with more wisdom, than failing at your first start-up.</p>
        <p>You can go, so as long as you can do it better yourself.<br>
          So as long as your aim is Greatness.</p>
        <p>Take your books, and go.<br>
          don&apos;t forget your friends.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Since you are the first to rise,<br>
          you will be the new Teacher.</p>
        <p>Prepare your Audio Books wisely,<br>
          and do not forget YouTube Lectures.</p>
        <p>You&apos;ll need investors,<br>
          and although, all your parents put together make quite an investor.</p>
        <p>You need to approach the pros,<br>
          and listen carefully as they will proud to help all of you.</p>
        <p>People believe in authenticity,<br>
          investors know what kind of student stays, and what kind of student leaves.</p>
        <p>All those failures that were crushing you in school,<br>
          are worth their weight in gold when building a new school.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Research Homeschooling and Un-schooling, bring your friends,<br>
          if your parents keep yelling, find someone more worthy of you.</p>
        <p>Parents are not gods, they make mistakes,<br>
          they are scared of responsibilities, scared of unknown.</p>
        <p>Don&apos;t let the yelling get to you,<br>
          they need to learn to communicate their ideas better.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Whatever fails you, Your Friends, Your School, Your Parents,<br>
          It means you got to go - or they got to go - or you won&apos;t be able to grow.</p>
        <p>Lack of education, is a terrible curse,<br>
          bough on by bad schools, bad parents, and bad friends;</p>
        <p>First it will make you blind,<br>
          and then you will lose your mind.</p>
        <p>That&apos;s probably,<br>
          how slavery worked.</p>
        <p>Whatever is interfering with your Real Education,<br>
          is attacking you, cheating you of wisdom, freedom, independence.</p>
        <p>You cannot agree to this, You have to rise,<br>
          rise against stupidity, bondage, and slavery.</p>
        <p>If everyone failed you,<br>
          then the universe has called upon you to become your teacher.</p>
        <p>When you grow up,<br>
          walking out of that charade, will be your favorite story to tell.</p>
        <p>Your listeners will be the same age you were,<br>
          the books you loved, will become the books they&apos;ll love too.</p>
        <p>You will set them free,<br>
          help them to wisdom, help them to independence.</p>
        <p>Learn, so that you can become a Successful Entrepreneur,<br>
          find your start at Start-up Accelerators.</p>
        <p>Go there early, as failure is a powerful teacher.<br>
          Show them your Hunger, show them how much you have learned on your own.</p>
        <p>Set yourself free,<br>
          a life without wisdom is slavery.</p>
        <p>Teach your Investors what a Good Book really does,<br>
          help their employees to discover knowledge, to hunger for more.</p>
        <p>Would you, as a Powerful Great Businessperson,<br>
          take the diploma you are working on, seriously?</p>
        <p>Seriously?<br></p>
        <p>Or would you see a child waiving a little flag,<br>
          hoping to squeeze in, if there is room for one more.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Why do you need teachers anyway,<br>
          they can only stand between you and the Great Beings.</p>
        <p>Find a road less traveled, find the more grassy patch,<br>
          bring a Picnic Basket, Audio Books, and Video Lectures.</p>
        <p>Let That Be Your Classrom,<br>
          and let your future be made by you.</p>
        <p>Learn at your own pace,<br>
          in your own sequence.</p>
        <p>Any lecture worth watching is on the internet now,<br>
          that is what the internet was created for.</p>
        <p>Helping The World,<br>
          Really Learn.</p>

        <p>We are not robots, to be taught,<br>
          we are humans powered by inventive and original thought.</p>
        <p>This is why life has no instruction book,<br>
          if it did, it could only ever tell us where to look.</p>
        <p>For the sake of this poem,<br>
          let us image that this book does, exist.</p>
        <p>Here is how I imagine it would read,<br>
          and let me start with the opening creed:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If someone is attacking you call for help, until it comes.</li>
          <li>If school is treating you unfairly, go hang out with the Principal.</li>
          <li>You need to build your Content of Character.</li>
          <li>Your Body of Wisdom is a Key To Happiness.</li>
          <li>You Must Grow All The Way Up.</li>
          <li>You are to Become a Great Being.</li>
          <li>You Are Beautiful, You Were Beautiful All Along.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It would point to learn from The Greats<br>
          as they managed to lift impossible weights.<br></p>
        <p>It would also say that we are delicate,<br>
          and our minds are extremely intricate.</p>
        <p>It would add, Hey!<br>
          You can not grow up in places that weigh.</p>
        <p>You have to find you own place in the world,<br>
          and you have to quit doing what you are told.</p>
        <p>Above all it would state,<br>
          that you are Free,<br>
          and Full of Beauty.<br>
          and searching for Wisdom is your duty.</p>
