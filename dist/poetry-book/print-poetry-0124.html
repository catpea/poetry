        <p>On the last day of the old year,<br>
          kids were granted the power to come up with a name for our newly united world...</p>
        <p>It all stared a long time ago, it was about not repeating history&apos;s mistakes,<br>
          a newly found emphasis on not committing the sins of our grand-grand-grand-fathers.</p>
        <p>Young people begun rejecting Jury Duty by recognizing Poverty as a mind eating virus,<br>
          when the Judge asked if anybody couldn&apos;t serve, people would rise and say &quot;Virus of Poverty&quot;.</p>
        <p>It meant that they were unable to take the oath, that they could not be an impartial Juror,<br>
          because they were convinced that Universal Basic Income would prevent The Defendant from committing the crime in the first place.</p>
        <p>The Judges had their hands tied, but they loved to hear it, and it always restored their faith in the world:<br>
          &quot;I stand against, The Disproportionate Mass Incarceration of People Made Ill by The Virus Of Poverty&quot;</p>
        <p>Back in 2021 schools had to go online, and that exposed their weakness for all to see,<br>
          people, and notably their future employers, lost interest in what organized education became.</p>
        <p>There was a shift toward self-organizing education where kids kept portfolios,<br>
          of their own paths through knowledge, and at their own natural pace.</p>
        <p>But it wast until the first paying school, that things became clear for the youngest generation,<br>
          the school replaced imaginary grades, with real money that the children would learn to reason about and use.</p>
        <p>By rejecting the status quo, and not settling on the irrelevant minimums,<br>
          Humanity increased her pace of progress, collective intelligence, and foresight.</p>
        <p>It took less than twenty years, to get climate under control,<br>
          it was the children of the people that grew up by questioning authority and status quo.</p>
        <p>Weapons manufacturing, profit optimization, economic fairy tales, greed, apathy, and hate - all fell,<br>
          as the world united under the new name: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boaty_McBoatface#Naming">Worldie McWorldface</a>.</p>
