        <p>Bicycling some years ago, out thirty miles away,<br>
          along a road, and an ancient highway.</p>
        <p>I found an overpass where I could perch upon,<br>
          and I discovered I wasn&apos;t really alone.</p>
        <p>I figured it was the a huge love story,<br>
          about a boy named Harold and a girl named Wally.</p>
        <p>She was a Book Worm, a Hero, and a Graffiti Artist,<br>
          and Harold loved her because she was the Smartest!</p>
        <p>Wally fell in love with Harold,<br>
          as she knew he was a Poet with a Heart of Gold.</p>
        <p>In 1980 some 40 years ago,<br>
          the two adventurers gave it ago.</p>
        <p>They set off for Center State,<br>
          and that became their Longest Date!</p>
        <p>It all their walking, it never rained,<br>
          and it never too sunny, neither complained.</p>
        <p>They waked holding hands together for a hundred miles,<br>
          their adventure was amazing, nothing but smiles.</p>
        <p>When they finally arrived at Mount Pleasant,<br>
          Harold quietly gave Wally her present.</p>
        <p>It was a little book of foolish rhyme,<br>
          that Harold wrote over a long stretch of time.</p>
        <p>They both just happily turned 57,<br>
          their life together is pure Heaven.</p>
        <p>Both are super smart, extremely young, and very strong,<br>
          their sweet love for each other, is lifelong.</p>
        <p>They still do their Mount Pleasant walk,<br>
          holding hands for days, sleeping-in until nine o&apos;clock.</p>
        <p>Harold makes really, really good Vegan Lettuce Wraps,<br>
          and Wally is a master at reading Maps.</p>
        <p>They&apos;ve been to all kinds of interesting places,<br>
          and they always arrive with beaming and smiling faces.</p>
        <p><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/U6ei19ABd6xffTcr6">Here</a> is where I took the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/kkGAfW13PLsA6H3D8">photo</a> few years ago,<br>
          just in case any of you guys want to go.</p>
