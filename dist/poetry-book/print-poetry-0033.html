        <p>Captain&apos;s Log, Quarantine, Day Twenty Eight,</p>
        <p>It&apos;s evening and it&apos;s late,</p>
        <p>Time for another poetic update,</p>
        <p>I sit here, and yet again, cogitate.</p>
        <p>It actually feels pretty great,</p>
        <p>I look forward to my little poetry date.</p>
        <p>And I always try to really concentrate,</p>
        <p>turn everything off and meditate.</p>
        <p>Let all those rhymes percolate.</p>
        <p>Let all those words decorate.</p>
        <p>Poetry is a universe in self,</p>
        <p>it won&apos;t always let you write what you are trying say.</p>
        <p>I just want to rhyme something funny,</p>
        <p>write about weather or how its sunny.</p>
        <p>But each poem has a mind of its own,</p>
        <p>each one is a kind of a milestone.</p>
        <p>There is a thousand ways to get to the end,</p>
        <p>but it all depends if the message is,</p>
        <p>what you intend.</p>
