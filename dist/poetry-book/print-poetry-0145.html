        <p>We are all very unique,<br>
          and we are irreplaceable.</p>
        <p>But the world is still growing,<br>
          and it may neither fit not truly inspire you.</p>
        <p>So you have to find out what really moves you,<br>
          what makes you stand on unshakable ground.</p>
        <p>Accepting the responsibility for your own education,<br>
          you must become authentic and unbreakable.</p>
        <p>You have to find what inspires you,<br>
          and carry on, on that path.</p>
        <p>Grow and develop and alter your course as fits you best,<br>
          but make sure that each day adds to the previous.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Do not alter course for unimportant reasons,<br>
          do not let strangers sway you.</p>
        <p>Resist action without thought,<br>
          and resist following orders without thinking.</p>
        <p>Resist red faces, and screaming authority,<br>
          and be careful because mistakes may try to sneak up on you.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Wisdom is not optional, it is the first and foremost,<br>
          and it will protect you from making your greatest mistakes.</p>
        <p>To grow up means to become a Great Being,<br>
          in your Heart, Body, Mind, All of Your Pursuits, and Your Entire Life.</p>
        <p>The path of growing up is built by inheriting wisdom,<br>
          from those of past generations, who have made the same effort.</p>
        <p>Please,<br>
          take to all the books loved by Great Beings,<br>
          and begin where they left off.</p>
