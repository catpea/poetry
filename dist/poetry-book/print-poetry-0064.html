        <p>Now is the time,<br>
          it is always the time.</p>
        <p>You are never too old,<br>
          you are never too large.</p>
        <p>But whoever you are,<br>
          You are always too beautiful!</p>
        <p>Jogging is a wise teacher,<br>
          it teaches bodybuilding.</p>
        <p>More importantly, it teaches,<br>
          that our bodies are powerful.</p>
        <p>But, they do not adapt as quickly,<br>
          as our fancies strike us.</p>
        <p>There is one fantastic way to jog,<br>
          measure how long you can run.</p>
        <p>And how long you need to rest,<br>
          to run that long again.</p>
        <p>Make the jogging number (1 minute)<br>
          and the rest number (2 minutes)<br>
          your friends for the Spring.</p>
        <p>Rest 5 times, jog four,<br>
          don&apos;t be too hard on yourself.</p>
        <p>Jogging is difficult,<br>
          because you should dance first.</p>
        <p>Dancing and walking,<br>
          are lovely at making you a Jogger.</p>
        <p>But if you are in a hurry,<br>
          as many joggers are,<br>
          a bit of Rest &amp; Jog Tango will do.</p>
        <p>So, rest, jog, rest jog, rest jog,<br>
          rest jog, and rest.</p>
        <p>Don&apos;t push yourself too hard,<br>
          but you have to run each day.</p>
        <p>Some days, you can just walk - so as long,<br>
          as it is three times longer than your jog.</p>
        <p>Above all, be good to yourself,<br>
          because, you are beautiful to me.</p>
        <p>And do not forget that you can put,<br>
          blueberry jam into a huge salad,<br>
          to make a new kind of fruit for health nuts.</p>
        <p>I know you can do it,<br>
          I believe in you, I really do.</p>
