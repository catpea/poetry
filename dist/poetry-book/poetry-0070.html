        <p>Wherever I went, Friday magically followed,<br>
          there always seem to have been a tree that was hollowed,</p>
        <p>And the moment I looked at food,<br>
          he knew, dinner was going to be good.</p>
        <p>Wherever the Raccoons came out at night,<br>
          Friday, was always there, my Fat Spirit Guide.</p>
        <p>Over at Little Torch Key, at Veterans Beach, with easy access to water,<br>
          he lived up a Palm Tree, with his Furry Wife and Tiny Daughter,</p>
        <p>Once I got lonely, and threw a little Tortilla all the way up there,<br>
          he popped up, and it looked like he smiled - I swear.</p>
        <p>Over at Ludington State Park, at the Jack Pine Hike-in Campground,<br>
          I woke up at 3 am, hearing a strange sound.</p>
        <p>He was trying to pull out my hamburger buns,<br>
          probably to feed all his furry sons.</p>
        <p>The bag was tied, up in a tree,<br>
          nothing could stop him - Because he was free.</p>
        <p>I got out of my tent, and delivered his late night bite,<br>
          by tossing it into my cranky neighbor&apos;s camp site.</p>
        <p>The whole woodland family, knew that eventually I had to go back,<br>
          Friday left a little footprint on my pillow, to help me pack.</p>
        <p>I was staying up in the trees, on top of ancient dunes,<br>
          the only light was that of stars, and the moon&apos;s.</p>
        <p>I called them <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/wsX31CTTXR4bzhza8">Nordhouse Skylands</a>,<br>
          but, if you go out there, be ready for his smart little hands,</p>
        <p>Bring a travel lock to secure the zippers on your tent,<br>
          and remember, Friday loves you as friend, he means no ill intent.</p>

        <p>My Dear Readers, we may each need a few weeks of Wilderness in our life,<br>
          so start slowly packing, buy a backpack, bug spray, and a knife,</p>
        <p>And just keep your adventure pack by the door,<br>
          if life ever gets you down, smile! and head for that Lake Michigan shore.</p>
        <p>You can park at the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/PhyA8hEuiAZnBmt1A">Nurnberg Trailhead</a>,<br>
          and don&apos;t forget to bring a little bit of stinky cheese,<br>
          and piece of stale bread.</p>
