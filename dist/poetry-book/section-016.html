        <p>Of all the filthy creatures from The Baltic Sea to Lake Michigan,<br>
          there is but one I miss and always rejoice to see again.</p>
        <p>Never, have I met a creature more Awful and Cheerful than the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring-billed_gull">Ring-billed Gull</a>,<br>
          and not a single moment we spent together was any dull.</p>
        <p>The most awful gang, lives over by the Ludington State Park,<br>
          they show up in the morning, and do not leave until dark.</p>
        <p>They are the hungriest, and the filthiest, and the most lovable bunch,<br>
          they live to entertain themselves and steal people&apos;s lunch.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>If there is one thing that needs to be said,<br>
          it is that they want to <strong>steal</strong> your food and <strong>really hate</strong> being fed.</p>
        <p>Once, I have seen them gang up on a fool holding up a chunk of bread,<br>
          they all swooped down squeaking, and I worried they&apos;d peck him dead.</p>
        <p>Though in the end he was probably fine,<br>
          as I saw him later in the day studying the &quot;DO NOT FEED SEAGULS&quot; sign.</p>
        <p>But as long as you let them steal your food,<br>
          they will keep you company, and all will be good.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>I also like those rare Seasoned Parking-lot Pirates that show up in Spring,<br>
          they can fly to any sea or ocean, but they pick a parking-lot; and that&apos;s their thing.</p>
        <p>They always seem like they up to something no good,<br>
          probably looking to deliver one of their sick gifts on someones hood.</p>
        <p>But, I always feel sad when they fly away for warmer climes,<br>
          they always remind me of strange wilderness adventures and good times.</p>

        <p>One late afternoon I hopped on my bicycle to ride the trail,<br>
          and returned with an interesting tale.</p>
        <p>For right where 275 and Michigan meet,<br>
          I found a <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/En5tWm4Z93mmwtZ28">little bicycle path that&apos;s really neat</a>.</p><br>
        <p>It is a huge park that branches out to two more little parks,<br>
          though they are behind peoples houses and pack a lot of dog barks.</p>
        <p>All combined together they make a sweet little quest,<br>
          but make sure to bring plenty of water and rest.</p><br>
        <p>The main path has little river bridges and lots of really neat sights,<br>
          but be really careful about ticks and mosquitoes bites.</p>
        <p>And that northern stretch under the power line, is a sight to see,<br>
          it is just a barren bumpy grassland without a single tree.</p><br>
        <p>If you keep going north on Haggerty you&apos;ll reach Ford,<br>
          and then you can bicycle back to 275 and get back on board.</p>
        <p>But I think the woodland trail is the best because there is a lot of shade,<br>
          I imagine that&apos;s why it was made.</p>

        <p>When you sense that fear is near,<br>
          begin thinking about all the things you hold dear.</p>
        <p>Think about how far you have already grown,<br>
          how much of what you love used to be scary or unknown.</p>
        <p>And do not let anyone try to control you with fear,<br>
          they are weak and their mind is already broken and unclear.</p><br>
        <p>Above all, know the weakness of fear,<br>
          all the things in your soul are far more real.</p><br>
        <p>But do not just close your eyes and let it pass,<br>
          turn inward to remember your beauty, strength and class.</p>
        <p>Let each time you get scared,<br>
          mark a day where you contemplate.</p>
        <p>Think about all the little wisdoms you love,<br>
          and how much more you learned by standing up when push came to shove.</p>

        <p>My Friends, it is very important not to think in terms of Others running the world,<br>
          whoever holds the power now, will be too old in a handful or years.</p>
        <p>The world is yours, but it is nowhere near ready,<br>
          it needs great ideas, a lot of work, and it comes with many challenges.</p>
        <p>The world you have been born into is not a static masterpiece,<br>
          but rather, it is constantly hoping for you to help it grow.</p>
        <p>You are the Hope and the Dream of past generations,<br>
          it is your responsibility to grow all the way up and continue and improve the work of Great Beings.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>We Grow,<br>
          by reaching out for Knowledge and Wisdom.</p>
        <p>This also means that when we are young, we are yet to gain the necessary Knowledge and Wisdom,<br>
          The content of character required for the correct decision making that will do justice to our elder selves.</p>
        <p>This means we need to take time to prepare ourselves for Life,<br>
          we have to make careful observations, and carefully capture all the worthy wisdom.</p>
        <p>We have to recognize that when lacking life experience,<br>
          we are other than we should be.</p>
        <p>There is a solution practiced by all the world&apos;s greatest minds,<br>
          it is the unrelenting pursuit of knowledge and wisdom.</p>
        <p>For thousands of years it has been proven method,<br>
          to help us become who we need to be to do our elder selves justice.</p>
        <p>We have no choice but to expand our minds with Knowledge,<br>
          and enlarge our worlds with Love of Wisdom.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>The World Grows,<br>
          by means of informed decision-making.</p>
        <p>Mislead or Uninformed decision-making is a Human Problem,<br>
          and all Human Problems, have Human Solutions.</p>
        <p>We have connected all the nations with internet,<br>
          we have created the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>.</p>
        <p>We have witnessed the creation of European Union,<br>
          countries that speak different languages.</p>
        <p>All the world accepted standardized schooling,<br>
          as a standard that we all follow.</p>
        <p>We have come a long way,<br>
          towards Wisdom and Peace.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Time has come to make better use of these amazing advancements,<br>
          and to hasten our pace of development as One Human Family.</p>
        <p>We face common problems that require an Informed and United World,<br>
          we have made many mistakes in the past 100 years, and we have learned much.</p>
        <p>We can no longer see ourselves as invisible parts of our little neighborhoods,<br>
          we must now rise to the challenges of becoming a Citizen of The World.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>We must grow beyond the need for our own Knowledge and Wisdom,<br>
          onward to making Meaningful and Lasting Contributions towards helping the world become more mature.</p>
        <p>We can no longer serve, as we are not heartless and soulless cogs in a blind machine,<br>
          we must now rise to question, judge, evaluate, challenge and fearlessly stand for wisdom.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>In all of Human History we never lost sight of Family, Peace, Wisdom, and Love,<br>
          not for a day, not for a moment.</p>
        <p>Every day of human history pushed to become better than the previous,<br>
          and any fractures that occurred have had the global community come together in hopes of repairs.</p>
        <p>Let us hasten our pace with an aim that none suffer for any reason,<br>
          be it hate, punishment, arrogance or ignorance.</p>
        <p>Where we cannot fix something, let us use the power of time,<br>
          and either prevent new fractures before they begin,<br>
          of establish benefits for those born after a certain year in the future.</p>
        <p>Let us never leave a chain-link unlined,<br>
          there is not to be a courtroom without a meaningful force of prevention and rehabilitation on each side.</p>
        <p>There is not to be a war,<br>
          where it could have been prevented with education, knowledge and wisdom.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Let us make sure that all generations from now on, know with certainty and understanding,<br>
          that their first step in life - and the true rite of passage - is the acquisition of wisdom,<br>
          and capacity of decision-making worthy of their elder selves.</p>
        <p>Above all, we must remind the children with Knowledge and Science,<br>
          that they are a Child of The Universe first.</p>
        <p>And with History,<br>
          that to them belongs the future.</p>
        <p>That they are to reject the status quo,<br>
          because what was well enough for the previous generation,<br>
          now needs improvement to do the current one justice.</p>

        <p>Great Adventures need not take you far,<br>
          and ultimately, wherever you go there you are.</p>
        <p>But still, there <strong>is</strong> something special about new places,<br>
          we see more deeply, and get in good graces.</p>
        <p>I think the kind of adventure, that <strong>really</strong> is the best,<br>
          will make you start keeping a little journal to document your quest.</p>
        <p>When there is time to think about all the things and little bits,<br>
          even the slightest curiosity will bring about new wits.</p>
        <p>So fill all the journal pages, and leave it for later,<br>
          because you never know when a little journal may become something greater.</p>
        <p>It could come as a surprise that this little adventure you took,<br>
          turned you into a Famous Writer and became your first Adventure Book!</p>

        <p>On the last day of the old year,<br>
          kids were granted the power to come up with a name for our newly united world...</p>
        <p>It all stared a long time ago, it was about not repeating history&apos;s mistakes,<br>
          a newly found emphasis on not committing the sins of our grand-grand-grand-fathers.</p>
        <p>Young people begun rejecting Jury Duty by recognizing Poverty as a mind eating virus,<br>
          when the Judge asked if anybody couldn&apos;t serve, people would rise and say &quot;Virus of Poverty&quot;.</p>
        <p>It meant that they were unable to take the oath, that they could not be an impartial Juror,<br>
          because they were convinced that Universal Basic Income would prevent The Defendant from committing the crime in the first place.</p>
        <p>The Judges had their hands tied, but they loved to hear it, and it always restored their faith in the world:<br>
          &quot;I stand against, The Disproportionate Mass Incarceration of People Made Ill by The Virus Of Poverty&quot;</p>
        <p>Back in 2021 schools had to go online, and that exposed their weakness for all to see,<br>
          people, and notably their future employers, lost interest in what organized education became.</p>
        <p>There was a shift toward self-organizing education where kids kept portfolios,<br>
          of their own paths through knowledge, and at their own natural pace.</p>
        <p>But it wast until the first paying school, that things became clear for the youngest generation,<br>
          the school replaced imaginary grades, with real money that the children would learn to reason about and use.</p>
        <p>By rejecting the status quo, and not settling on the irrelevant minimums,<br>
          Humanity increased her pace of progress, collective intelligence, and foresight.</p>
        <p>It took less than twenty years, to get climate under control,<br>
          it was the children of the people that grew up by questioning authority and status quo.</p>
        <p>Weapons manufacturing, profit optimization, economic fairy tales, greed, apathy, and hate - all fell,<br>
          as the world united under the new name: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boaty_McBoatface#Naming">Worldie McWorldface</a>.</p>

          we find comfort in recognizing where something starts, and where it ends.</p>
        <p>Knowing the beginning and seeing the ending helps us feel in control,<br>
          it helps us see the journey&apos;s end, or the height of a challenge.</p>
        <p>But all of that goes away when we begin rising,<br>
          eventually we only consider the forward motion it self.</p>
        <p>We ignore the beginning, we abandon the ends, we ignore the steps,<br>
          and we stop measuring the distance and paying attention to the effort.</p>
        <p>In advancing forward we learn to recognize that all things must connect,<br>
          we can only find peace in a mesh-work of common concerns and dreams upheld by all.</p>
        <p>The roads we must travel have no limits, and it never takes long to catch up,<br>
          nobody falls behind for too long unless they practice resignation.</p>
        <p>We need not travel far to begin seeing that the word is still very young,<br>
          that passage of wisdom between generations is a very fragile process.</p>
        <p>Many, who are not yet mature enough for the position they have gained, may feign authority,<br>
          we have to be careful who we listen to and be mindful of the paths they have traveled.</p>
        <p>We are the sum of all our rising, all our triumph, effort, and intent across all our ages,<br>
          how we rose, and the choices we made, and the wisdom we grew with, all adds to the sum.</p>
        <p>That sum doesn&apos;t just outline our personality and who we are in the now,<br>
          it is the structure of our wisdom and the body of our knowledge, directed towards who we will become in the future.</p>
        <p>A choice we make in the now, will paint a moment in our past, but also influence what is yet to come,<br>
          and all the choices added together create who we are in the future that we will eventually enter.</p>
        <p>We must take great care of our choices, we must take care to love ourselves,<br>
          to find the calm and peace from which we can make healthy decisions that will help us grow.</p>
        <p>Not everyone will start in a colorful city with good schools and amazing friends,<br>
          some will struggle to rise out of extremes that will never make sense.</p>
        <p>But we must still set ourselves on that unlimited path,<br>
          and get used to the idea of no beginnings, and no ends, just that all too human forward motion.</p>
        <p>The direction is always the same, move towards wisdom,<br>
          that is the meeting point of all human beings no matter their circumstance or culture.</p>
        <p>We begin as children, we mature into adults, and then we must go on to become Great Beings,<br>
          all Greatness is rooted in Love of Wisdom, and the root of wisdom is found in boldly facing the challenges of life.</p>
