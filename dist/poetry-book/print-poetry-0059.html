        <p>We must Always wisely choose Maximum over Minimum,<br>
          because the minimums will attack our mind and body.</p>
        <p>When hoping to live life to the fullest,<br>
          we have to choose the big things very carefully.</p>
        <p>Health, is an example of a big thing,<br>
          everything we do, must stand in support of it.</p>
        <p>Time, is a big thing,<br>
          everything we do, must count.</p>
        <p>We must frequently ask,<br>
          &quot;Is this event harming or helping me?&quot;</p>
        <p>We must frequently ask,<br>
          &quot;Will this matter in six months, or next year?&quot;</p>
        <p>We must ask,<br>
          &quot;What are the regrets of my older self?&quot;</p>
        <p>Because only you can judge yourself,<br>
          you must grow in wisdom, and age gracefully.</p>
        <p>Do not miss the point of life -<br>
          You are meant to become a Great Being.</p>
        <p>You are to search and find the Light of Your Life,<br>
          and discover a way contribute to Wisdom.</p>
