        <p>Where do we come from, and why are we here,<br>
          are just silly questions.</p>
        <p>While even silly questions lead to good things,<br>
          they&apos;re not the primary questions we need to answer - like what makes us unique, and what do we love, and where are going to go, and what great mountains must we face.</p>
        <p>We are here because there was no one to count the failed attempts,<br>
          because the universe was running out of other paths.</p>
        <p>There was no plan,<br>
          there was just a progression forward.</p>
        <p>Universally speaking, there is probably plenty of life out there,<br>
          but what the Universe will never have, cannot build, is another You.</p>
        <p>If someone tried to take your place,
          it could never work, ever, at all.</p>
        <p>In All This Complexity,<br>
          You Are One And Only.</p>
        <p>There will never be another you,<br>
          ever.</p>
        <p>It is because at a certain point, the Universe stops, and your ideas take over,<br>
          you become the creator, you become a Youniverse within a Universe.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>You are plenty special, but if you only move forward,<br>
          you will not gain the capacity to fully share who you are.</p>
        <p>The universe will know, that you are Majestic, and Adventurous,<br>
          and sometimes, Mischievous. But we need more of you!</p>
        <p>We need Your Sculptures!<br>
          We need Your Poetry!<br>
          We Need Your Works,</p>
        <p>So that we may learn,<br>
          and maybe continue your work.</p>
        <p>We Have Questions,</p>
        <p>And you are the only one with your answers,<br>
          so grow up already, build up, create and share your wisdom.</p>
        <p>The Wisdom you will gain from your Pursuits of Excellence,<br>
          will be unlike anything else the Universe has ever seen before.</p>
        <p>You will speak in your own pictures, with your personal touch,<br>
          and the words you love, and above all the Paths You Took.</p>
        <p>With Your Help and Works,</p>
        <p>Humanity will become Wiser,<br>
          and more beautiful.</p>
        <p>Help Us See.</p>
