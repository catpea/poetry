        <p>Somehow, Wednesday turned out to be the tiniest day.<br>
          I was quiet all day, slowly programming away.</p>
        <p>I&apos;ve been thinking about my bicycle, birds, and rain,<br>
          but mostly working on my new website domain.</p>
        <p>My bicycle trails have been calling me all week,<br>
          I prepared my bicycle and am I ready, so to speak.</p>
        <p>There was much rain today,<br>
          it will take a few more days, before I pedal away.</p>
        <p>It is not always about the adventure,<br>
          I love how all the spring trees smell.</p>
        <p>How the birds sing in the morning,<br>
          how the air is crisp and new.</p>
        <p>I never set a plan as to how far I will ride,<br>
          I just get on the bicycle and enjoy the outside.</p>
        <p>Every once in a while I perch upon an overpass,<br>
          scribble code, or just watch the cars sometimes.</p>
        <p>There are many memorable places along the way,<br>
          they are all very tiny and hidden away.</p>
        <p>Old graffiti, sculptures and parks, abandoned railway,<br>
          I could talk about them all day.</p>
