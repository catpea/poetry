        <p>Captain&apos;s Log Supplemental, Quarantine, Day Forty.</p>
        <p>We are born to run our fingers through infinity,<br>
          be it Wright Brothers or Yuri Gagarin, Galileo Galilei.</p>
        <p>It is our right to touch the greatest of heights,<br>
          and it is our privilege to cheer for each other in triumph.</p>
        <p>We have no flaws, no ugliness, no weakness, and no limit,<br>
          be it Tenzing and Hillary, or Viktor Emil Frankl.</p>
        <p>Nothing can stop us,<br>
          there are no bars thick enough,<br>
          there are no bars strong enough,</p>
        <p>&quot;We are the Captains of our Souls,<br>
          And The Masters of Out Fate&quot;</p>
        <p>However, there is a culture that we must never let go of,</p>
        <p>The culture of, Love of Wisdom,<br>
          The culture of, Inheritance of Knowledge.</p>
        <p>If we are tricked to reject Wisdom,<br>
          and if there is no teacher or parent,<br>
          or friend left to remind us,<br>
          then all will be lost.</p>
        <p>Your work will not set you free,<br>
          it is a lie as old as slavery.</p>
        <p>Your teachers can only remind,<br>
          but they cannot reach into your mind.</p>
        <p>Fight for your right to knowledge,<br>
          there is no university,<br>
          there is no college,<br>
          you have to use your heart to learn,<br>
          only you can do that.</p>
        <p>Without Inheritance of Wisdom,<br>
          you will become cursed to start at zero.</p>
        <p>As magnificent as your battle will be,<br>
          you will only reach a path, that was walked countless times before.</p>
        <p>You must start,<br>
          where the greatest minds <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Science_communicators">left off</a>.</p>
