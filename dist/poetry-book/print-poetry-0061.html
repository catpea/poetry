        <p>If you don&apos;t care about yourself,<br>
          People will get scared of you.</p>
        <p>Because, if you get hurt,<br>
          you will hurt them too.</p>
        <p>You have to watch yourself,<br>
          be compassionate to yourself.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Ask...</p>
        <p>Is working too many hours a day,<br>
          helping or harming me?</p>
        <p>Are Office Walls,<br>
          helping or harming me?</p>
        <p>Does loneliness help you?<br>
          Or does it harm you?</p>
        <p>Same for getting scared,<br>
          Does hiding really help you?</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Overwork and Office is unhealthy,<br>
          take those skills, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoqgAy3h4OM">build</a>.</p>
        <p>Take it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68jy3_ABvRo">outside</a>,<br>
          let Nature nurture you.</p>
        <p>In her silence,<br>
          she will help you remember who you are.</p>
        <p>You must learn to treat your body with compassion,</p>
        <p>You must learn to take Great Care of our mind.</p>
        <p>And please,<br>
          make every day count.</p>
        <p>We are so beautiful,<br>
          such powerful dreamers.</p>
        <p>Above All,
          Love Yourself.</p>
