        <p>Captain&apos;s Log: Quarantine. Day Twenty,</p>
        <p>the promised day of rhyme a plenty.</p>
        <p>I am sitting here with my salad,</p>
        <p>expecting to write world&apos;s littlest ballad.</p>
        <p>I waited until the conclusion of day,</p>
        <p>to see with what rhymes that may pay.</p>
        <p>Alas, twenty just about rhymes with plenty,</p>
        <p>it rhymes as good as yeti and orange.</p>
        <p>On the other hand Twenty One,</p>
        <p>rhymes with all under the sun.</p>
        <p>I am sitting here smacking my lips,</p>
        <p>Counting down 90 days to Penumbral Eclipse.</p>
        <p>I made little sausages to add to my salad,</p>
        <p>I added really spicy dressing to spruce up my ballad.</p>

        <p>My Little Fort (note orange tent in the center)</p>
        <p>As I grilled the little things, I remembered that same smell,</p>
        <p>it was back when I lived in the ancient dune wilderness.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0025-x.jpg" alt="X"></p>
        <p>Little Sausage Dinner</p>
        <p>That memory really rings a bell,</p>
        <p>It was at the height of my loneliness.</p>

        <p>My Evening Couch, as I waited for Lake Michigan Sunsets</p>
        <p>Deep woods, ancient dunes,</p>
        <p>and warm and sunny afternoons.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0025-k.jpg" alt="K"></p>
        <p>Deep in Woods</p>
        <p>Not all afternoons were sunny, I once got a heck of a reminder,</p>
        <p>One cold afternoon I remembered that I get scared of thunder.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0025-c.jpg" alt="C"></p>
        <p>And My Evening Wear</p>
        <p>Not, little thunder of course,</p>
        <p>the scary ones, that always strike with great force.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0025-t.jpg" alt="T"></p>
        <p>Dark Evening</p>
        <p>It was almost never scary, certainly never scary for long,</p>
        <p>it would pass, and moon or sun would rise, followed by birdsong.</p>

        <p>People taking photos of my Horses</p>
        <p>I remember by the beach many stood,</p>
        <p>as I built horses out of driftwood,</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0025-i.jpg" alt="I"></p>
        <p>Horse 2.0</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0025-j.jpg" alt="J"></p>
        <p>Horse 3.0</p>
        <p>The height of my loneliness,</p>
        <p>also came with a great deal of silliness,</p>

        <p>Beach House</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0025-m.jpg" alt="M"></p>
        <p>Beach House</p>
        <p>I waived to the future, and to today,</p>
        <p>Look at me, I am a Cowboy! Say, Hey!</p>

        <p>Howdy!</p>
