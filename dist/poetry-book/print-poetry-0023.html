        <p>Captain&apos;s Log: Day Eighteen of Quarantine.</p>
        <p>Researching, learning, computers being mean.</p>
        <p>It must be Friday, the eve of Eighteen,</p>
        <p>I peeked outside and I think the trees are turning green.</p>
        <p>But the squirrels, again, they act so weird,</p>
        <p>smart little kitties worried that everyone disappeared.</p>
        <p>Speaking of weird, programming is such a fun game,</p>
        <p>I am convinced it is unhealthy, but I think that&apos;s a shame.</p>
        <p>My computer programs kept me company since I was nine,</p>
        <p>I was so little, and already learning the command line.</p>
        <p>Alas, the time doth fly,</p>
        <p>as we grow older we must take to the sky.</p>
        <p>We have to learn beyond what is at our fingertips,</p>
        <p>and set aims for all those leaderships.</p>
        <p>We should pamper our talents, can&apos;t leave them behind,</p>
        <p>as we grow older they&apos;ll play a very important role in our peace of mind.</p>
        <p>My readers, we are each charged with becoming Teachers,</p>
        <p>share our knowledge, become Reason&apos;s own preachers.</p>
        <p>The Future is only as bright as Her Humanity,</p>
        <p>we are Her dignity, Her keepers of sanity.</p>
        <p>So, search for <a href="http://catpea.com/warrior">video tutorials</a>,</p>
        <p>maybe open a book,</p>
        <p>and take a look.</p>
