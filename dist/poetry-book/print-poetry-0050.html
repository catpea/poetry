        <p>As I woke up this morn,<br>
          I knew my recreational programming schedule will be torn.</p>
        <p>I put on my slippers, and I shuffled down stairs,<br>
          and begun slowly sorting through all my kitchen wares.</p>
        <p>For today, is my Spring Cleaning day,<br>
          and I will have little time to play.</p>
        <p>I wished and washed, and sloshed and swished,<br>
          in the end all my cleaning sponges looked squished.</p>
        <p>To complete my mission, I had to update my fire alarms,<br>
          so I grabbed my ladder, and put tools under my arms.</p>
        <p>My bendy scissors, and my rusty screwdriver<br>
          that looks like I stole it from a scuba diver.</p>
        <p>And climbed, my three little steps,<br>
          all the while flexing my triceps.</p>
        <p>When I finally made it to the top,<br>
          the little screw wouldn&apos;t fit, so I got down and poked it with my mop.</p>
        <p>I said, &quot;This a job for &apos;mah power-tools,<br>
          I need my drill, this ain&apos;t no job for fools.&quot;</p>
        <p>I cannot describe to You with what amazing grace,<br>
          I made that hole, and fireproofed my place.</p>
        <p>As I was making my way down,<br>
          I almost felt like I earned a crown.</p>
        <p>But, when I reached the bottom, I found a screw,<br>
          I must have dropped it... it was brand new.</p>
        <p>But! In the end I made it all work,<br>
          and muttered, &quot;Guess, I am not such a dork.&quot;</p>
        <p>Now, when I look up and tilt my head,<br>
          I can see it... slowly blinking red.</p>
