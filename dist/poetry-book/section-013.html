        <p>Every one in a while I bicycle to the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/J7BhcUqsPx1wNJEBA">south end</a>,<br>
          and check if they did any work, and how it went.</p>
        <p>I always find it old, and full, of bumps thorns and grass,<br>
          no matter how hard I bicycle, there is never a way to pass.</p>
        <p>I work up this morning, and said &quot;It is time for another check!&quot;,<br>
          I got my gear together, and squirted sunblock all around on my neck.</p>
        <p>And as soon as got too far to go back,<br>
          my bicycle, creaked, and shuddered, and squeaked - and I was like &quot;What the heck?&quot;</p>
        <p>The noise came from the bottom where the pedals are,<br>
          and only the left pedal made noise thus far.</p>
        <p>And the noise would not cease,<br>
          I had the tools but no grease.</p>
        <p>So I said to my self in a deep tone &quot;It is time for Field Repair!,<br>
          and although I have no grease, I will not despair.&quot;&quot;</p>
        <p>First, I checked the pockets of my new red pants, the short ones that I like,<br>
          but there was nothing there that could fix my bike.</p>
        <p>So I looked to my day pack, and the solution sat right next to my bicycle lock,<br>
          I squeaked! &quot;I do have grease, it is in my sun block!&quot;</p>
        <p>So I squired some on the pedals and the connecting rod,<br>
          and though I admit the solution was a bit odd...</p>
        <p>I was back on the road, riding smoothly and quietly like a pro,<br>
          after all, I had places to go.</p>
        <p>I made it to the southern edge, it was 15 miles away,<br>
          they still didn&apos;t fix anything, bumps and shrubs were blocking the way.</p>
        <p>I took a photo to share with you,<br>
          just in case you were thinking about going or pushing through.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0108-end.jpg" alt="Path"></p>
        <p>The <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/oRaowTwL1cdz5G549">actual ancient end of the trail</a> is not that far away,<br>
          about 2.6 miles south, but you are better off walking the rest of the way.</p>
        <p>Even better than following the ancient end, is to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/j93A21irtxaaRzd96">go to the park</a>,<br>
          and head for lake Erie, but make sure to leave early, so that you don&apos;t bicycle back after dark.</p>
        <p>The trick to make it to the lake is to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/yDvAJg3dUWX2atPY9">turn right before</a> the Nature Center,<br>
          and head through Flat Rock, to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Uq1DXX5HRwXxYtcW7">Maple Beach</a>, you don&apos;t have to pay to enter.</p>
        <p>I think of it as the real end to the trail,<br>
          reaching it always make for a good tale.</p>

        <p>Life shouldn&apos;t be about beating your best,<br>
          just as important as rising, is your day of rest.</p>
        <p>No matter how important your athletic quest,<br>
          or how upon your arrival you are going to be blessed.</p>
        <p>Everyone, needs to get some rest,<br>
          days will only get longer when you are stressed.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>If you must,<br>
          imagine you are a Bird of Fantastic Plumage, and your bed is a nest.</p>
        <p>Come morning, fling up your messy crest,<br>
          and puff up your chest.</p>
        <p>And tweet, about how you are not getting dressed,<br>
          because you are too stressed, and you are having your rest.</p>
        <p>And explain to those confused, that you are not speaking in jest,<br>
          make it clear that this is not, a test.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Today is <em>your</em> day of rest,<br>
          at best, you will be having a nice cup of tea, should you feel pressed.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Allow strength to return to you, so that you are at your best,<br>
          tomorrow, or in few days, you&apos;ll resume your quest.</p>
        <p>Once you are not feeling so stressed,<br>
          you&apos;ll show the world that You are the Best.</p>

        <p>My Friends,</p>
        <p>Your youth holds a great power,<br>
          a power that you can hold on to throughout your entire existence.</p>
        <p>It is the power of creating a life that you will love,<br>
          a life that will help you see with great clarity.</p>
        <p>A Life of Wisdom.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>But you must be careful,
          as the world may not yet be ready to help you.</p>
        <p>Not everyone will know about growing up,<br>
          and people will say: &quot;How was I supposed to know?&quot;</p>
        <p>And they are not going to be the bad guys,<br>
          and you will be inclined to listen to their advice.</p>
        <p>And the path will be paved with good intentions,<br>
          it maybe the correct path, but it won&apos;t be the right one.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Please, focus on building your own self,<br>
          your strength, your wisdom, your power.</p>
        <p>Focus on building the best you,<br>
          the you that you are meant to be, that the world needs.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Because if you listen to everybody else,<br>
          you will not grow up, and they will blame you for not being able to help them.</p>
        <p>You are not going to be able to explain to them,<br>
          that you are weak because of them,<br>
          because you tried to help them too early.</p>
        <p>And if you could, all they could say will be:<br>
          &quot;How was I supposed to know?&quot;</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Please, you have no choice,<br>
          but to learn to control your own future.</p>
        <p>You can try to use your imagination,<br>
          to get in touch with your Elder Self;</p>
        <p>And ask &quot;What are your regrets?&quot;,<br>
          &quot;Where did it go wrong?&quot;</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Please, carefully evaluate your choices,<br>
          wisely build your Mind and Body.</p>
        <p>Pay attention to all the choices you are making,<br>
          as they dictate the Beautiful Life Ahead of You.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>The teachers are not ready, we are not in the Era of Wisdom yet,<br>
          people are struggling to understand life.</p>
        <p>Many make choices that all too early box them in,<br>
          and not all their advice will apply to you.</p>
        <p>Not all the things that you think box people in,<br>
          actually constrain them, there are many contexts to all the paths.</p>
        <p>All lives are beautiful, and there are enough forks in the road,<br>
          for people to navigate back to where they want to be.</p>
        <p>But, when a mistake occurs, it will weigh you down for a time,<br>
          if you are careful, you can avoid the worst of it.</p>
        <p>And whatever does happen, regardless of how hard you tried to avoid it,<br>
          will not crush you, because you will know you did your best.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Please, be careful in life, be beautiful, and strong,<br>
          learn, and think, and evaluate, and judge, and grow in wisdom.</p>
        <p>Following everyone&apos;s advice, will create a lot of noise,<br>
          listening to everything from everywhere will never align with you.</p>
        <p>You must lean to pace yourself,<br>
          and to carefully and wisely follow what interests you.</p>
        <p>Your mind is constantly asking questions,<br>
          your future depends on having a good intuition, rooted in reality, and in wisdom.</p>
        <p>There is nothing you can be force-taught school,<br>
          you will not retain things that are out of sequence.</p>
        <p>Reaching out for Knowledge and Wisdom in your own sequence, and at your own pace,<br>
          is the only way to learn, and build steps, and build on top of those steps.</p>
        <p>No one can decide what lesson you are ready for next,<br>
          that is something that comes from the complexity of your own mind.</p>
        <p>Those people who are doing well in school without cramming and memorization,<br>
          have previously arrived at those subjects in their own sequence.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>The same applies to your job, your career,<br>
          your career needs to emerge from the path you were growing up with.</p>
        <p>It needs to be an an extension of your pursuits,<br>
          it must benefit you, and help you grow.</p>
        <p>Just like you must actually learn, instead of just getting grades,<br>
          your work must add to you, and not, rob you of your years.</p>
        <p>Do you understand the value of a Single Year of Your Precious Life?<br>
          no one can put a price on that, not even you, there are not enough atoms in the Universe.</p>
        <p>That is why Harmony with Education, and Work is so important,<br>
          each year must be lived on the path that makes you grow.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>I am so sorry, that people will tell you to cram for tests,<br>
          and get a job, and get on with life.</p>
        <p>I am so sorry, My Friends,<br>
          but that is the worst, you can do.</p>
        <p>That&apos;s why you can&apos;t listen to anyone,<br>
          that&apos;s why you have to look into yourself.</p>
        <p>Carefully evaluate all decisions,<br>
          whilst carefully evaluating consequences, and being mindful of your future.</p>
        <p>You are not alone, look to Memoirs, look to Biographies,<br>
          listen to Audiobooks, Explore, and Create.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>And you must take care of your body,<br>
          the best you can, at first.</p>
        <p>And with each year,<br>
          you will gain more, and add a bit more as you grow in Health and Fortitude.</p>
        <p>Your Elder Self needs to be Flexible, and Healthy,<br>
          you may never grunt and complain, that&apos;s something you have to be mindful of now.</p>
        <p>It is not just about making choices for your Future,<br>
          but also for your body too.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Do you see how going along with cramming for tests,<br>
          can put you in a field where your job makes life more stressful,<br>
          which will prevent you from taking good care of your body?</p>
        <p>Imagine the consequences of walking a path that is not truly your own,<br>
          and what will your Elder Self feel when you two finally become, One?</p>
        <p>Be gentle with yourself,<br>
          this is Your Life, Your Beautiful-Beautiful Life.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Put down the incomprehensible Text Book, the standardized tests,<br>
          and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/130.Best_Audiobooks_Ever">find</a> an Audiobook that you will love and actually learn from.</p>
        <p>Stop trying to find a job or get hired, and become the kind of a person;<br>
          that companies can only hope to hire.</p>
        <p>Start living healthy, years before you start your training,<br>
          do not force your body into endurance, gradually teach it to adapt.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Chose Audio-books that really help your wisdom grow,<br>
          embrace your hobbies, and expand your adventures.</p>
        <p>If you can&apos;t find a career path that will add onto you,<br>
          then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4JtyLKDjXk">start your own company</a>,
          or become a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRLzkbtKPGM">co-founder</a>.</p>
        <p>Take care of your body, be mindful of you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index">Body Mass Index</a>,<br>
          but also aim to become a Healthy Athlete, Heath will never take away from you.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>In all we do, in choices, or intuitions,<br>
          we re driven by the wisdom we have thus far acquired.</p>
        <p>A decision that made sense in your youth,<br>
          may reverse, as you gain wisdom from Books and Experiences.</p>
        <p>The richer our Pursuit of Wisdom,<br>
          the more in-tune our decision-making.</p>
        <p>Wisdom surrounds Education, Carrier and Health,<br>
          it influences your Private Decision-making, and thus Your Future.</p>
        <p>In most contexts Wisdom is the most important thing,<br>
          what can be more important than the thing that influences your private decision making?</p>
        <p>And be mindful that your decision making is in turn,<br>
          the very thing that influences all the future ahead of you?</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>The beginning of your Knowledge and Wisdom is found in the things you love as a child,<br>
          in a way those things are questions, and playing with them brings answers.</p>
        <p>But you have to stay with it,<br>
          protect the natural progression of the chain of your curiosities.</p>
        <p>You have to understand the the Destructive Power of:<br>
          &quot;cram, get a job, and get on with your life&quot;.</p>
        <p>We don&apos;t live in a world that can support your Pursuit of Wisdom,<br>
          for most, the world will give minimums, for many nothing.</p>
        <p>When we try to create external machinery,<br>
          it will often perform the minimum.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>The power for the world to change,<br>
          is within each of its Citizens.</p>
        <p>It is found in decision making,<br>
          perpetually strengthened by Unrelenting Pursuit of wisdom.</p>
        <p>We create this world together,<br>
          and it can only grow, when we grow.</p>

        <p>Authenticity would be Wonderful on its own,<br>
          it helps with trust, admiration, knowing, feeling.</p>
        <p>But, actually, it is far more than that,<br>
          it reflects Fundamental Principles of The Universe.</p>
        <p>There is a very big difference, between crossing a real bridge,<br>
          and a fake one.</p>
        <p>Or, reading a book for real, and pretending to read.<br>
          Or, studying a Field of Science and, and cramming for a test.<br>
          Or, doing something for a grade, and doing something for your mind.<br>
          Or, doing something for real, and pretend to do something.<br>
          Or, being your complete self, and being what others approve of.<br></p>
        <p>The one thing in common here, is one is a fantasy that ends,<br>
          and the other, just is ... and grows, and alters the course of life ahead.</p>
        <p>It is a testament to our connection with the Universe,<br>
          that an Authentic Human Being will grow Healthy and Strong, and Keep Expanding.</p>
        <p>The best example of this is getting an education that looks great on paper,<br>
          but does nothing for interacting with the real word.</p>
        <p>A similar example has to do with a great job that pays well, that goes great,<br>
          but halts a person&apos;s development, and robs them of their youth, dreams, and hopes,<br>
          robs them of the highest version of themselves.</p>
        <p>Time, cannot be warped, or faked,<br>
          it ticks away, our bodies grow, day by day, year by year, decade by decade.</p>
        <p>The long-vision of becoming of ourselves, will reveal that the first and foremost,<br>
          and most dominant and meaningful thing, is our acquisition of wisdom.</p>
        <p>Acquisition of Wisdom is deeply connected to Authenticity,<br>
          Courage, Dignity, Nobility, Pursuit of Knowledge, Rising, Growing Up.</p>
        <p>Time helps our bodies progress forward,<br>
          but it is Wisdom that helps our Minds.</p>
        <p>Authenticity, gives us this incredible power to start something today,<br>
          that will make us Wiser, Healthier, Happier, Filled with More Insight.</p>
        <p>And not merely tomorrow, but for all our time to come,<br>
          as in Authenticity, each day adds to the previous.</p>

        <p>My Friends, Build Your Mind,<br>
          Build Your Body.</p>
        <p>Do not ignore your well being,<br>
          you require Blue Skies, Seas, Mountains, Oceans, Lakes, and Forests.</p>
        <p>Do not ignore your Body,<br>
          it needs care and exercise, and proper diet.</p>
        <p>Do not merely hope to get a job,<br>
          make companies hope they can hire you.</p>
        <p>Do not ignore the Content of Your Character,<br>
          spend many great adventures in pursuit of wisdom and insight.</p>
        <p>Do not ignore Your Beautiful Heart,<br>
          keep rising, keep searching, keep shining.</p>
        <p>Build Your Life, like a Sculptor Builds a Sculpture.<br>
          Ensure Strength, Beauty, Authenticity, Dignity, Nobility, and Restraint.</p>
        <p>And when you run out of strength, and it will happen often,<br>
          laugh as you pick yourself up,<br>
          and your laughter will connect with the laughter of all the other Great Beings who rose before you.</p>
        <p>Your life, is to become a Work of Art,<br>
          day by day you must add to it, make it more beautiful.</p>
        <p>Our civilizations, cultures, and the world, may not be ready to embrace your growing up,<br>
          many will stand in your way, some even with advice that sounds good.</p>
        <p>Never follow,<br>
          Always lead.</p>
        <p>Know that all the steps you take toward wisdom and Enlightenment count,<br>
          and you will never regret this journey - as Rising Up, is a Law of the Universe.</p>
        <p>All the Great Beings who have risen before you,<br>
          had only one regret: &quot;I should have risen faster.&quot;</p>
        <p>So get up,<br>
          and Go!</p>

        <p>We are too good, at working too hard,<br>
          this is why we must stay on guard.</p>
        <p>Your mind is more than just a tool,<br>
          it is a rare and beautiful jewel.</p>
        <p>Many hope that you will never know,<br>
          that your generation is the new new hope, for the world to grow.</p>
        <p>But, if we just close our eyes and let mistakes repeat,<br>
          the world will fade away in silent defeat.</p>
        <p>Go, take to adventure, pack, and get into you car,<br>
          so that you will never forget who you really are.</p>

        <p>To slowly turn your life, into Art,<br>
          small, is the best way to start.</p>
        <p>Small means but tiny discomfort,<br>
          at first, make your adventures very short.</p>
        <p>You don&apos;t have to go out, all the way,<br>
          let the sky, mountains, and sea invite you out to play.</p>
        <p>And the call rarely ever comes from something big,<br>
          it will be more like a fragrant breeze, or muddy shoes, or the snap of a twig.</p>
        <p>Before you know it, you&apos;ll be packing up for Nordhouse Dunes,<br>
          hoping to be the first to greet all the Fancy Raccoons.</p>
