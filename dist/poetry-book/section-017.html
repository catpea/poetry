        <p>Of course,<br>
          let us ask what their regrets are...</p>
        <p>We are after all the future generation,<br>
          to those that came before us.</p>
        <p>Therefore we have insight,<br>
          and certainly have regrets.</p>
        <p>We regret;<br>
          wars, poverty, hate and stupidity.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>We want World Peace,<br>
          because a single Human Life is more Sacred than all the gods put together,<br>
          because borders are stupid and war is hell,<br>
          because ongoing weapons manufacturing is evil.</p>
        <p>We want the End of Poverty,<br>
          because money should only be used to help a person and not make them worse,<br>
          because no one should be denied mental, dental or medical care,<br>
          because not a single Human Being should ever go hungry or thirsty.</p>
        <p>We want the Age of Wisdom,<br>
          because people must learn how to think before being told what to think,<br>
          because the Modern Human being must first catch up with Knowledge in Beloved Books,<br>
          because we must put an end to making mistakes that can otherwise be avoided.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>The World will not grow if Human Beings are prevented from Meaningful Education.<br></p>
        <p>The World will not grow if People are too scared, or too hungry, or too tired to learn.<br></p>
        <p>The World will not grow, if You, and I, and Everybody Else fails to Honor the Future Generations.<br></p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>As many evil forces as there are,<br>
          they will give up the moment they see that their lies can&apos;t move crowds anymore.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Moving against reality,<br>
          commits the followers to the forgotten side of history.</p>
        <p>Standing up for Truth and Authenticity,<br>
          fills us with Light of Wisdom, and Love of Humanity.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>You never know,<br>
          the first day,<br>
          when you become ready,</p>
        <p>to reinforce, or add a new article,<br>
          to a document that will define Humanity for all Generations.</p>
        <p>We can&apos;t be sure if this document exist yet,<br>
          perhaps you will begin writing it,</p>
        <p>perhaps your article will be the opening article,<br>
          and yours, the first signature.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>There are to many borders, My Friends,<br>
          and too often money is being used for harm, where it was invented for good.</p>
        <p>Our World, with Our Love and Our Blessing,<br>
          must take another Deep and Long Breath,<br>
          and Exhale in Blooming Changes all around.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Practice, take out your journal, and scribble to no end,<br>
          many high and mighty laws printed over and over on paper will not hold up forever.</p>
        <p>Humanity never moved toward some Economic Paradise,<br>
          it has always moved towards Goodness and Love.</p>
        <p>It has moved slowly, slowed down by poverty of so many,<br>
          slowed down by borders,<br>
          and people not yet ready to learn how to think before they are told what to think.</p>
        <p>But it has moved with unlimited strength,<br>
          sanding down to dust all that stood in the path of Good Ideas, and Goodness, and Love.</p>
        <p>Do not accept wrongs, on paper, or law, or the red faces of those moving against the grain of reality,<br>
          do not assume that the wrongs that stand today, will not be erased tomorrow.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Proudly, nobly, respectfully, deep in thought,<br>
          take time off, and reach out to world&apos;s best selling non fiction.</p>
        <p>My Friends,<br>
          May you laugh, may you celebrate, may you admire,<br>
          and learn from; and forgive mistakes leaving them to the past.</p>

        <p>I dreamt I was tumbling through time,<br>
          and I had no control over which fragments I see.</p>
        <p>There was a mother writing a letter to a famous movie star,<br>
          she was asking him to stop making movies, because her boy didn&apos;t comeback from war.</p>
        <p>And it worked,<br>
          and she wrote many letters.</p>
        <p>There was a lot of shocked artists and actors,<br>
          they had no idea how they shaped young impressionable minds.</p>
        <p>Boys wanted to go to real war,<br>
          to be like the imaginary heroes they saw on TV.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>And then I struggled in my dream, because my bullies were clearly ill, they were not all there,<br>
          but World&apos;s Systems of Justice do not differentiate between the ill and the healthy.</p>
        <p>And so a person made permanently ill in their mind by poverty,<br>
          is seen equal to a man of knowledge, insight, intelligence.</p>
        <p>But the ill have little freedom of choice,<br>
          they need therapy, and safety, and good homes, and hope, and dreams.</p>
        <p>To punish someone who couldn&apos;t grow up, didn&apos;t know to learn,<br>
          for something that they weren&apos;t sure they were doing,<br>
          and then to send them to a hopeless place without a hope of healing,<br>
          without any hope of rehabilitation... is wrong.</p>
        <p>If they can&apos;t walk among us, if they are permanently ill,<br>
          then build special schools for them, schools that bring hope.</p>
        <p>We mustn&apos;t punish them more than life already had,<br>
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2tOp7OxyQ8">our humanity depends on everyone&#x2019;s humanity</a>.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>And I saw Mr. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6IKu2wgm5I">Pirsig</a> on his motorcycle with his boy,<br>
          the wind in his face representing the cutting edge of reality.</p>
        <p>He was worried that his Metaphysics is not real philosophy,<br>
          it was not going to be taken seriously.</p>
        <p>The answers they discovered on road they traveled and experiences they shared,<br>
          created the Body of Knowledge that provided them with the forward momentum they needed to move ahead.</p>
        <p>I dreamt that Pirsig was just talking bout Authenticity, Nobility and Dignity,<br>
          and Knowledge and Wisdom, and Wise Intuition.</p>
        <p>He is unafraid to show us how vulnerable Philosophers are,<br>
          that all it takes is ideas worth sharing, once or twice.</p>
        <p>Anybody can be a philosopher,<br>
          we will each be heard.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>All these strange fragments added together - to remind us that the World is Not Static,<br>
          that it grows, moves, changes, and cares not to stop for things writ on paper.</p>
        <p>Advancements in Psychology... the trailer to the movie about Philip Zimbardo work - alone,<br>
          should invalidate laws and behaviors previously thought acceptable.</p>
        <p>Humanity must grow, our cultures must drive us all forward,<br>
          we must never assume that the world we are born into is a masterpiece.</p>
        <p>And we must never let ourselves think,<br>
          that others are in charge - it is our world, it belongs to us all.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>To make informed decisions,<br>
          we require knowledge, wisdom, foresight, insight, a sense of belonging.</p>
        <p>Without knowledge, we will not be able to see right from wrong,<br>
          nor will any of our decisions do our elder selves justice.</p>
        <p>Access to well grounded knowledge is not difficult,<br>
          internet lectures - alone - may even suffice, but best selling non fiction audio books solve it completely.<br></p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Humanity must not fall behind on growing up,<br>
          the longer the delay the greater the injustice.</p>
        <p>Read and Listen to you books, my Friends,<br>
          inherit the lifetimes of knowledge within.</p>
        <p>We can&apos;t send people to prison without any hope of rehabilitation,<br>
          for uninformed decisions that came on a whim.</p>
        <p>And we can&apos;t allow mere Practice of Law without Functional Rehabilitation,<br>
          and above all Meaningful Education and Universal Basic Income that truly lifts people out of Poverty.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>We Are The People,
          we outgrew borders long ago, we are One Family on a Lonely Blue Earth.<br></p>
        <p>We must learn to catch up with what is worthy of knowing,<br>
          we can use Science, or Love, or both, or the Leading Edge of Instinct powered by our Humanity.</p>
        <p>But we must continue building this world,<br>
          each generation must make improvements and never stop.</p>
        <p>Those who stand in power today,<br>
          are to soon gracefully surrender to the better wisdom of the new generation.</p>
        <p>To preside is to wisely wait whilst the new generation becomes worthy of the position,<br>
          and to quietly step down, and put whatever wisdom was discovered to the books of history.</p>
        <p>To preside, means not, to continue repeating mistakes because they are on the books,<br>
          and therefore one will not be punished.</p>
        <p>There are only two sides to history, and only fools think it is the winning and the losing one,<br>
          the two sides as seen by future generations is the Wrong One, and The Noble One.</p>
        <p>Let us all rise to the challenges of wisdom,<br>
          and making lasting and meaningful contributions to the Human Family.</p>
        <p>Let us not be lost to the wrong side,<br>
          let us not be passed over by the books of history,<br>
          let us help wisdom propagate.</p>
        <p>Let us stand up to every corner and every challenge,<br>
          and let us speak out against the wrong, the mistakes, the incomplete, the unfinished.</p>
        <p>Let us not accept half measures, or good enough, or status quo,<br>
          or the lowest common denominator minimums that get commited to law books.</p>
        <p>Let us remember who we are,<br>
          and how Noble The Human Being.</p>
        <p>Let us stand upright,<br>
          in Authenticity, Dignity, Wisdom and Compassion.</p>

        <p>While Constitutions and Declarations,<br>
          age and get amended, to become other than intended.</p>
        <p>Most beloved poetry is writ in stone,<br>
          loved and celebrated, and hard to forget.</p>
        <p>So, let us write poems to celebrate every era,<br>
          and each new idea worthy of us and the modern times.</p>
        <p>Humanity has always faced great challenges,<br>
          and the greatest challenges moved us the most.</p>
        <p>Today, we must fix Education for all,<br>
          and it <strong>has to</strong> result in creating Wise Great Minds.</p>
        <p>We have to fix World Poverty,<br>
          as it too often destroys minds before they can even put up a fight.</p>
        <p>And we have to create a clearer picture of the world,<br>
          poems that reveal problems before they come into being.</p>
        <p>Above all we have to help Young People,<br>
          help them to understand the world better.</p>
        <p>Help them gain early insight,<br>
          so that they are not easily manipulated.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>At the very least,<br>
          we have to explain;</p>
        <p>How borders divide,<br>
          and how divided, we are made to fight.</p>
        <p>How easy it is to dress ignorance in authority,<br>
          how some principals, or teachers, or parents, never cared, and never will.</p>
        <p>How poverty is not the fault of the children born into it,<br>
          but a mark of broken and immature and selfish politics.</p>
        <p>How talent, and genius, and genes are a stupid myth for poor angry little men,<br>
          how self education is far more meaningful, and how and noble.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>You, my Dear Readers,<br>
          You are <strong>full</strong> of Great Ideas.</p>
        <p>The things you wish you knew when you were younger,<br>
          are more important than you think.</p>
        <p>Those are the ideas that will create<br>
          unforgettable poetry.</p>
        <p>Please, pick up a pencil, pick up a keyboard,<br>
          and rhyme or arrange, impress with words, with inspirational letters.</p>
        <p>The ideas you hold dear,<br>
          make you a philosopher, a poet, and artist.</p>
        <p>The ideas you hold dear make you a teacher,<br>
          Please, help the world learn.</p>

        <p>Hey! whew,<br>
          it&apos;s only eight,</p>
        <p>and here I was worried,<br>
          that I am going to be late.</p>
        <p>Today is Friday,<br>
          and on every Friday I must look,</p>
        <p>for new ideas,<br>
          to add to my fancy <a href="https://westland-valhalla.github.io/warrior/">Warrior Book</a></p>
        <p>It is a book,<br>
          made out of videos,</p>
        <p>and some ideas,<br>
          don&apos;t have enough of those.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Last week,<br>
          I searched for &quot;Ladies Fast Draw&quot;,</p>
        <p>but it only returned three videos,<br>
          last time I saw.</p>
        <p>I also tried Women Sharp Shooting,<br>
          and Compound Bow,</p>
        <p>but something didn&apos;t fit,<br>
          the chapter just didn&apos;t flow.</p>
        <p>I am searching for<br>
          inspirational things,</p>
        <p>ideas that bring friends together,<br>
          and give them wings.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>I wrote that book to show all;<br>
          that we all start slow,</p>
        <p>but we can all become mighty,<br>
          so as long as we give it a go.</p>
        <p>All too frequently we assume,<br>
          that we have to have talent.</p>
        <p>and all the steps we take,<br>
          must be naturally gallant.</p>
        <p>But the truth is,<br>
          that we must fail to get there,</p>
        <p>effortlessly succeeding at anything,<br>
          is as boring as rare.</p>
        <p>No need to hurry,<br>
          we can learn really slow,</p>
        <p>the most important thing,<br>
          is that we grow.</p>

        <p>I always try hard to learn something new,<br>
          so that my elder self can mumble &quot;I grew.&quot;</p>
        <p>I try to listen to a non-fiction book or two,<br>
          to update my general world view.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>And I do computer programming and research too,<br>
          I have lots of bookmarks in my queue.</p>
        <p>I am trying to write programs as if I had a crew,<br>
          so I stick to simple systems where I can think things through.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Learning Life, and Programming somehow fits me like a shoe,<br>
          I&apos;ll have to make a list of the books and papers I read through.</p>
        <p>I never have to try to look for something new,<br>
          there are too many beautiful things to get bored, or blue.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>I like learning about things that are most Human and true,<br>
          trying to figure our what our elder selves wished they knew.</p>
        <p>Someday, I would like to write a book to help young people get a better world view,<br>
          something short and beautiful that they can quickly finish, slam shut, and say &quot;Who knew?&quot;</p>

        <p>Summer and Winter, Spring, and Autumn are my favorite seasons,<br>
          but today, Winter came to mind; for many reasons.</p>
        <p>For one, it is Summer, a Hot Summer, Heatwave in full swing,<br>
          and I can&apos;t believe what great relief; a little snowfall would bring.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0131-walk.jpg" alt="Walk"></p>
        <p>And I found a winter photo of an expedition to a near by store,<br>
          I look thrice my size, I can&apos;t even imagine how many layers I wore.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0131-icycle.jpg" alt="Icycle"></p>
        <p>Then I remembered when back in 2014 the Polar Vortex was all the talk,<br>
          I was so excited to dress up and go on a long walk!</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0131-icycle-smile.jpg" alt="Smile"></p>
        <p>But, my favorite memory is riding my bicycle and hitting a patch of ice,<br>
          I fell sideways upside-down, and did a little looptie-loop, twice.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0131-fall.jpg" alt="Fall"></p>
        <p>I landed perfectly flat with a winter splat kicking up the downy flake,<br>
          and I lay there a bit muttering, &quot;What a story this will make&quot;.</p>
        <p><img src="image/poetry-0131-the-end.jpg" alt="The End"></p>
        <p>I love Blinding Summers, and Rainy Autumns, and Spring when all the flowers grow,<br>
          but I am a huge fan of Winter and all that bright white snow.</p>

        <p>Without learning we cannot grow up,<br>
          and without teaching the world cannot progress.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>It does not matter where you start your journey,<br>
          be it top of the world, or the very bottom, or somewhere in the middle.</p>
        <p>Wherever you start, you must immediately begin moving forward,<br>
          step after step, find what moves you, use it to grow up.</p>
        <p>Grow to create a solid thought, or dream, or aim, or understanding,<br>
          and get on top of it, and start building the next thing.</p>
        <p>The road to catching up with everyone else is very short,<br>
          once you are there, like everyone else, you take off in your own unique direction.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>We must let go of beginnings and ends,<br>
          and questions of lengths of road we must travel.</p>
        <p>We must let go of things that we can&apos;t finish in time to enjoy life,<br>
          empires ought be build by generations of visionaries, not a single inspired being.</p>
        <p>We must put majority of our existence towards a happy meaningful life,<br>
          not struggle, or war, or fear, but simple meaningful beautiful happiness.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>We must not forget about the importance of Meaningful and Enlightening Education,<br>
          the world is not able to give all a safe home but we can learn to build one.</p>
        <p>And once we learn, and find peace in life,<br>
          we should consider becoming teachers.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>By teaching people, by giving them the right tools, by helping them see how to accomplish great deeds,<br>
          we also grant them the path, to get where they will bloom at their healthiest, and thus Find Hope.</p>
        <p>Inadequate education is one of the greatest barriers to a healthy existence,<br>
          but it is also the <strong>weakest</strong> barrier, as it is removed with simple audio-books.</p>
        <p>We should encourage people to search for best selling non fiction,<br>
          and inherit both Lessons, and the Culture of Successful Great Beings.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>All the problems we face are Human Problems, and thus the solution is in Our Hands,<br>
          as humans we know that the source of our Powers is in our Minds.</p>
        <p>That is where must begin our Lives,<br>
          by making our minds Strong, Noble, Authentic, Unbreakable; Dignified.</p>
        <p>Let the self correcting nature of inheritance of knowledge from all our Beloved Great Beings,<br>
          be the start of our battle against all the problems that plague our Civilization and Cultures.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>Without wisdom all serious problems bear negative consequences,<br>
          consequences that help to multiply problems until there seemingly seems to be no solution in sight.</p>
        <p>But that is an illusion,<br>
          instead of building more prisons to contain minds sickened by poverty, let us teach meaningful wisdom and knowledge.</p>
        <p>We must learn to prevent minds from fracturing, and from getting lost, and from not growing up,<br>
          we must build a better world for all.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p>To build a better world we must fearlessly challenge ourselves to success,<br>
          to wisdom, to knowledge, to noble pursuits of excellence.</p>
        <p>And then boldly teach,<br>
          all the lessons that moved us.</p>
