harmony we learn, and thrive.\n\nAway from it, we'll be interrupted,\nand feel lost in the void.\n\nIt is a simple choice,\nbut out minds are not ready to make it.\n\nOften we forget.\n\nWe forget about our little gardens,\nand all the little walks.\n\nWe forget how amazing it felt,\nto stand on the wing of a plane.\n\nWe forget the taste of popcorn at the Zoo,\nor even how enormous Zoo felt.\n\nWe forget pebbles at the river,\nand mischievous squires at the park.\n\nThat little dog with a bark,\nthat scaredy kitten always hiding in the dark.\n\nOur collection of unused keys,\nand the box of bottle caps we collected with ease.\n\nWe forgot our Lego and the old bike,\nwith that seat that we used to really like.\n\nWe don't remember the Palaces and Castles,\nthat we used to love, and those swords, that fit us like a glove.\n\nEverybody else came around,\nacting like they know the ground.\n\nBut, this was our gift from the Universe,\nan affinity for flowering gardens, and little passage ways, and all those flying planes.\n\nIt was a key to unlock our mind,\nto understand the zoo, and our size in the universe, connect with pebbles at the beach.\n\nIt is a pathway that fits us best,\nto love little creatures, and collect some shineys, and build with blocks, and ride far and wide.\n\nIt was to remind us,\nto find our place among Great Beings, and study and pursue excellence, in all we do.\n\nThen they sent us to First Grade,\nand the weird kid peed into the Duplo, they didn't even have Lego.\n\nThen the teacher graded you down for counting pebles in your pocket,\nand did it so many times, you lost track.\n\nThere was a whisper about the pebbles,\nit was Mr. Sagan - \"You are made of Star Stuff.\"\n\nAnd then the kids whispered...\nto push you in the mud.\n\nPush their laughter aside,\nyou'll need to Learn, and learn really hard.\n\nCause right now, you're in the mud,\nand you need to hang on.\n\nIt will get worse,\nbut all you have to do is rise.\n\nEach time,\nyou'll rise higher.\n\n(When in trouble, call the Police it is OK for kids to call the Police, they'll love helping you, don't be scared.)\n\nThird Grade,\nFifth Grade.\n\nLow grade,\nUhh, but there can't be higher.\n\nBecause by this time, you're getting bad grades,\nbecause the teacher thinks you're copying from somewhere.\n\nThe bullies know,\nyou did it on your own.\n\nSaw you pacing for days,\nwith your first program.\n\nKeep going forward,\ndon't let go - you're doing great, stay away from the hate.\n\nBy the time you're out of Eight Grade,\nby rejecting crazy, and nonsense, and stupid, and lazy, you graduate above all others.\n\nBecause you didn't follow,\nbecause you chose to study on your own, at your own pace.\n\nBecause worthless grades meant nothing,\nyou felt no stress.\n\nBecause, you didn't follow\nnothing could hurt you.\n\nAnd your world is yours,\ntruly-truly yours.\n\nWe unravel, when we forget who we are,\nthe moment we hide, or pretend, or follow.\n\nAnd, gosh darn it,\nit happens when we are still kids.\n\nWe are completely unprepared,\nand none will help.\n\nSo you! have to keep it together,\nyou can't let anyone hurt your mind.\n\nIn High School, the pretenders make a sudden appearance,\nnever held a book in their hand.\n\nThe back of Hamlet,\nall the quotes have more IQ.\n\nLet the little Caesars,\nkeep the wind from the hall away.\n\nYou need to pace your reading at the library,\nteach yourself focus.\n\nDon't EVER! finish the books,\njust get to the part that is valuable to you, and skip the rest.\n\nStart working on your start-up early,\nit is a study in failure.\n\nYou need to create a series of CONTROLLED FAILURES,\nthis is very important.\n\nLearn [content management][1],\nand figure out [billing][2]\n\nThat's your surface platform,\nand think about nature of business.\n\nNever try to build things directly,\nfacilitate the building of direct things for others.\n\nHelp them setup,\nso that you are not burdened, and keep going.\n\nLook at the structure of start-up accelerators, or even banks,\nthey take a percent, and never create what will weigh them down.\n\nEventually, you can build your own Tesla,\nbut at first, you start with services.\n\nLook at the gym,\nmonthly subscription, is most stable.\n\nThe lessons, are all around you.\n\nYou don't need college,\nbut taking college classes is very relaxing.\n\nMake sure you get a 4.0 at each class,\nbe ready to repeat it.\n\nAnd enjoy,\nthe lectures.\n\nCollege is just a toy,\nit looks bad on your Portfolio, so hide it.\n\nIt is a very weak teaching experience,\nand people know that there there is minimal learning involved.\n\nJumping from high school to start-ups is more impressive,\nand shows that you chose knowledge over nonsense.\n\nIt shows that you chose to learn on your own,\nto take care of your own mind,\nrather than to pretend to learn for grades.\n\nAuthenticity is very important in life,\nit is hard to connect with people that role play.\n\nBonding with people that are just acting,\nis only functional for as long as they are acting.\n\nBut it is never good,\neventually they'll have a crisis, similar to a mid-life crisis.\n\nStay Authentic,\nkeep to to those who are Authentic.\n\nBe safe.\n\nWhen it feels like everyone else is having an amazing life,\nand you are stuck.\n\nUmm... that not true\n\nBut it is also not healthy to think this way about yourself,\nyou are not beneath the party goers, they don't have what you have in your mind.\n\nBut, that's far enough,\ntime to get some rest.\n\nThis is where it gets interesting,\nyou have primed your mind for Business.\n\nThat is a fine first step,\nnow you need to get ready for the real graduation.\n\nYou need to section hike the equivalent of the Appalachian Trail,\nand measure your jogging a hundred miles at a time.\n\nSection jogging, the Western States 100.\n\nMind and Body, for the rest of your life.\n\nYou must take good care of both.\n\nAt mile fifty, halfway through a run,\nas you piece together your blurry thoughts of your next business.\n\nTake some time to understand what it is that College Grads have,\nthose are very brittle relationships, and inflexible careers.\n\nWe all feel the promise, but we can't fake it,\nit would be the opposite, and certainly not worthy of you, my Friends.\n\nYou can only find your meaning in Authenticity,\nshortcuts will only take you back to the beginning.\n\nTo live among the Extraordinary,\nyou must become Extraordinary yourself.\n\nThe gateway to Meaning of Life,\nis in that tiny moment when you think to your self:\n\n\"I am not going to jog tonight, I need rest.\"\n\nRight there in that dot,\nis the keyhole,\nto the key that you are,\nto the gateway that you need to open.\n\nLife is not a simulation,\nthere are no days off,\nlife is quite a challenge,\nand demands that each moment builds on the authenticity of the previous.\n\nOpen the dot, how can you yearn for Authenticity and Companionship,\nand cancel, and fall short, and not enough, and rest some more.\n\nThe gateway between Ordinary and Extraordinary,\nis in accepting that we haven't got a choice to make.\n\nBut shoes... to put on,\nyour Mind and Body must grow in harmony.\n\nYou must not let go of the Harmony,\nof your Magnificent Existence.\n\nEach small success, by subtle analogy,\npushes you forward, to your next step.\n\nEventually your tightly controlled business failures,\nwill fail, they will, fail to fail.\n\nYour mind too,\nit won't perceive the easy choice as an option.\n\nAll- will proceed,\nin harmony.\n\nLabored breathing,\nby the Pine Trees at Western States,\n\nAnother great step in Automation of your business,\nand more investors.\n\nAnd you're no longer stopping at

influences,\nare trying to figure out where they went wrong - good luck!\n\nCollege, is still a very romantic idea,\nbut it is best left to imagination.\n\nYour dreams are so much more now,\nonly what you create can live up to them.\n\nYou are a Leader,\nfull of might an joy.\n\nAnd now you know,\nshortcuts only lead people to their beginnings.\n\nAnd the one road, the only road,\nwas the one of Authenticity, and Achievement.\n\nWhere we learned for real, not for grades,\nwhere what we learned added up to create wisdom, and not a stupid GPA.\n\nYou'll be OK, so as long as you Learn onward and

You don't need a charging bear to learn.\nYou can use clay, or canvas, or music.\n\nThere is no finer way to push loneliness away,\nthan to sculpt the meaning of touch.\n\nAnd there is no better way to learn courage,\nthan to paint a chain of works that inspire to motion.\n\nAnd music need not make someone cry to be powerful,\nmake the beat move your own feet, as you run your first ultra.\n\nConsider how simple a Desktop in your Operating System is,\nand yet, how perfectly impossible it is, to drag the icon out of the computer.\n\nIt is right there, you can wiggle it,\nand yet it is trapped in a prison, of invisible walls.\n\nAnd consider, how different you are, from all the people you have met,\nhow you don't even smile at the things that make them laugh.\n\nHow not a single person out of the Eight Billion,\ncould possibly take your place.\n\nHow often it feels that all the people around you are sleepy,\nhow some seem different, because they could not do, what they do, if they were not wide awake.\n\nTo integrate with wisdom, you cannot read the same books others read,\nyour mind represents a perfectly unique constellation of stars.\n\nTo integrate with wisdom,\nnot only do you have to indirectly wiggle around by subtle analogy to other things.\n\nBut you have to fish out just the perfect morsels that fit you,\nin just the perfect sequence, out of a unique collection of mutually reinforcing works of Philosophy.\n\nYou start in the beginning, with Survey Courses, as these outline the most brilliant ideas first,\nthere you can recognize thoughts that fit you, that you already had in your constellation.\n\nOrganized Education, poisons your confidence in education, because everything they teach,\nis in an inhuman, synthetic, and impersonal sequence.\n\nMoreover, the easily forgotten and fragile clusters of incomplete information,\naim to build on one another, they guarantee you won't understand, and will only overwhelm you in the end.\n\nThe celebrating of a Diploma, is a sacred ritual, that has been erased, and replaced,\nwith a more sugarcoated \"I am finally out\".\n\nThis is a perfect recipe for bondage, blindness, weakness,\nand worse.\n\nWe must not allow a fake sugar pop triumph,\nto replace the Real Triumph or Knowledge and Wisdom.\n\nIt can only get worse,\na day will come when the Libraries will close.\n\nSchool and Library, above all, were meant to be a symbol,\nan extension to your own self education.\n\nYour Education,\nthe pathway to Peace, Safety, Security, Self Control, Harmony, Enlightenment.\n\nWhat has occurred to cause the fog, is a drop of packets of information,\nwe are too complex, the world is too complex, parenting is too complex, teaching is too complex.\n\nIt can get worse, if we continue celebrating false graduations, and fake education,\nif we keep forgetting that our family, has Eight Billion members and each must grow up for real.\n\nThe solution is to remind ourselves, that growing up is not about feeling like an adult,\nbut rather Transcending our Limits, and Pushing Through gaps, towards Wisdom.\n\nWe face problems that can only be solved by Intellectual or Cultural Unity.\n\nThe Problem of War, is solved by Education, Wisdom, and Unity.\n\nThe Problem of Education, is solved by Helping Everyone to a Fair Start.\n\nThe Problem of Crime, can be Solved by Mental Heath Care, and Prevention.\n\nThe Problem of Poverty and Slavery, is Solved by Universal Income.\n\nAll these problems are our problems, and the solutions are ours as well.\n\nBut they rest across a Gap, a gap that Humanity must cross.\n\nAnd the next step,\nis your step.\n\nNothing worth your precious time, can be faked, or made up, or make believe,\nit all has to be Authentic, Powerful, Guttural, Raw.\n\nIt will hurt in the Muscle and Bone,\nbut eventually you'll forget to pay attention to what is unimportant.\n\nYou are not to be taught that you are dime a dozen,\nand that they just can't find a job for you, because you don't fit or conform.\n\nPeople believe this nonsense,\nbecause they don't have anything to draw from by subtle analogy.\n\nThat is why we must challenge ourselves to Great Deeds,\nto acquire the experiences necessary to tell Wisdom from Waste.\n\nWhen you hear someone putting you down, pushing you around, belittling you,\nyou are to leave, because that someone has fractured and broke, and are now ill.\n\nIt is the oldest and sickest trick,\nto convince someone they don't matter.\n\nThey do it for personal gain, money or laziness,\nto people who do not have a library of Grand Experiences from which they can draw wisdom, by Subtle Analogy.\n\nGet Up.\n\nFind your temple of solitude, The Two Beautiful Trees, The Bridge Over Hudson River,\nThe Highway Overpass, The Starry Beach where the Stars Come Out at Night and mingle with Starfish.\n\nAnd know, that you are a Child of The Universe, first,\nThat!

      "text": "My Friends,\n\nYour youth holds a great power,\na power that you can hold on to throughout your entire existence.\n\nIt is the power of creating a life that you will love,\na life that will help you see with great clarity.\n\nA Life of Wisdom.\n\nBut you must be careful,\nas the world may not yet be ready to help you.\n\nNot everyone will know about growing up,\nand people will say: \"How was I supposed to know?\"\n\nAnd they are not going to be the bad guys,\nand you will be inclined to listen to their advice.\n\nAnd the path will be paved with good intentions,\nit maybe the correct path, but it won't be the right one.\n\nPlease, focus on building your own self,\nyour strength, your wisdom, your power.\n\nFocus on building the best you,\nthe you that you are meant to be, that the world needs.\n\nBecause if you listen to everybody else,\nyou will not grow up, and they will blame you for not being able to help them.\n\nYou are not going to be able to explain to them,\nthat you are weak because of them,\nbecause you tried to help them too early.\n\nAnd if you could, all they could say will be:\n\"How was I supposed to know?\"\n\nPlease, you have no choice,\nbut to learn to control your own future.\n\nYou can try to use your imagination,\nto get in touch with your Elder Self;\n\nAnd ask \"What are your regrets?\",\n\"Where did it go wrong?\"\n\nPlease, carefully evaluate your choices,\nwisely build your Mind and Body.\n\nPay attention to all the choices you are making,\nas they dictate the Beautiful Life Ahead of You.\n\nThe teachers are not ready, we are not in the Era of Wisdom yet,\npeople are struggling to understand life.\n\nMany make choices that all too early box them in,\nand not all their advice will apply to you.\n\nNot all the things that you think box people in,\nactually constrain them, there are many contexts to all the paths.\n\nAll lives are beautiful, and there are enough forks in the road,\nfor people to navigate back to where they want to be.\n\nBut, when a mistake occurs, it will weigh you down for a time,\nif you are careful, you can avoid the worst of it.\n\nAnd whatever does happen, regardless of how hard you tried to avoid it,\nwill not crush you, because you will know you did your best.\n\nPlease, be careful in life, be beautiful, and strong,\nlearn, and think, and evaluate, and judge, and grow in wisdom.\n\nFollowing everyone's advice, will create a lot of noise,\nlistening to everything from everywhere will never align with you.\n\nYou must lean to pace yourself,\nand to carefully and wisely follow what interests you.\n\nYour mind is constantly asking questions,\nyour future depends on having a good intuition, rooted in reality, and in wisdom.\n\nThere is nothing you can be force-taught school,\nyou will not retain things that are out of sequence.\n\nReaching out for Knowledge and Wisdom in your own sequence, and at your own pace,\nis the only way to learn, and build steps, and build on top of those steps.\n\nNo one can decide what lesson you are ready for next,\nthat is something that comes from the complexity of your own mind.\n\nThose people who are doing well in school without cramming and memorization,\nhave previously arrived at those subjects in their own sequence.\n\nThe same applies to your job, your career,\nyour career needs to emerge from the path you were growing up with.\n\nIt needs to be an an extension of your pursuits,\nit must benefit you, and help you grow.\n\nJust like you must actually learn, instead of just getting grades,\nyour work must add to you, and not, rob you of your years.\n\nDo you understand the value of a Single Year of Your Precious Life?\nno one can put a price on that, not even you, there are not enough atoms in the Universe.\n\nThat is why Harmony with Education, and Work is so important,\neach year must be lived on the path that makes you grow.\n\nI am so sorry, that people will tell you to cram for tests,\nand get a job, and get on with life.\n\nI am so sorry, My Friends,\nbut that is the worst, you can do.\n\nThat's why you can't listen to anyone,\nthat's why you have to look into yourself.\n\nCarefully evaluate all decisions,\nwhilst carefully evaluating consequences, and being mindful of your future.\n\nYou are not alone, look to Memoirs, look to Biographies,\nlisten to Audiobooks, Explore, and Create.\n\nAnd you must take care of your body,\nthe best you can, at first.\n\nAnd with each year,\nyou will gain more, and add a bit more as you grow in Health and Fortitude.\n\nYour Elder Self needs to be Flexible, and Healthy,\nyou may never grunt and complain, that's something you have to be mindful of now.\n\nIt is not just about making choices for your Future,\nbut also for your body too.\n\nDo you see how going along with cramming for tests,\ncan put you in a field where your job makes life more stressful,\nwhich will prevent you from taking good care of your body?\n\nImagine the consequences of walking a path that is not truly your own,\nand what will your Elder Self feel when you two finally become, One?\n\nBe gentle with yourself,\nthis is Your Life, Your Beautiful-Beautiful Life.\n\nPut down the incomprehensible Text Book, the standardized tests,\nand find an Audiobook that you will love and actually learn from.\n\nStop trying to find a job or get hired, and become the kind of a person;\nthat companies can only hope to hire.\n\nStart living healthy, years before you start your training,\ndo not force your body into endurance, gradually teach it to adapt.\n\nChose Audio-books that really help your wisdom grow,\nembrace your hobbies, and expand your adventures.\n\nIf you can't find a career path that will add onto you,\nthen start your own company,\nor become a co-founder.\n\nTake care of your body, be mindful of you Body Mass Index,\nbut also aim to become a Healthy Athlete, Heath will never take away from you.\n\nIn all we do, in choices, or intuitions,\nwe re driven by the wisdom we have thus far acquired.\n\nA decision that made sense in your youth,\nmay reverse, as you gain wisdom from Books and Experiences.\n\nThe richer our Pursuit of Wisdom,\nthe more in-tune our decision-making.\n\nWisdom surrounds Education, Carrier and Health,\nit influences your Private Decision-making, and thus Your Future.\n\nIn most contexts Wisdom is the most important thing,\nwhat can be more important than the thing that influences your private decision making?\n\nAnd be mindful that your decision making is in turn,\nthe very thing that influences all the future ahead of you?\n\nThe beginning of your Knowledge and Wisdom is found in the things you love as a child,\nin a way those things are questions, and playing with them brings answers.\n\nBut you have to stay with it,\nprotect the natural progression of the chain of your curiosities.\n\nYou have to understand the the Destructive Power of:\n\"cram, get a job, and get on with your life\".\n\nWe don't live in a world that can support your Pursuit of Wisdom,\nfor most, the world will give minimums, for many nothing.\n\nWhen we try to create external machinery,\nit will often perform the minimum.\n\nThe power for the world to change,\nis within each of its Citizens.\n\nIt is found in decision making,\nperpetually strengthened by Unrelenting Pursuit of wisdom.\n\nWe create this world together,\nand it can only grow, when we grow.\n\n\n[find]: https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/130.Best_Audiobooks_Ever\n[start your own

alone - may even suffice, but best selling non fiction audio books solve it completely.\n\nHumanity must not fall behind on growing up,\nthe longer the delay the greater the injustice.\n\nRead and Listen to you books, my Friends,\ninherit the lifetimes of knowledge within.\n\nWe can't send people to prison without any hope of rehabilitation,\nfor uninformed decisions that came on a whim.\n\nAnd we can't allow mere Practice of Law without Functional Rehabilitation,\nand above all Meaningful Education and Universal Basic Income that truly lifts people out of Poverty.\n\nWe Are The People,\nwe outgrew borders long ago, we are One Family on a Lonely Blue Earth.\n\nWe must learn to catch up with what is worthy of knowing,\nwe can use Science, or Love, or both, or the Leading Edge of Instinct powered by our Humanity.\n\nBut we must continue building this world,\neach generation must make improvements and never stop.\n\nThose who stand in power today,\nare to soon gracefully surrender to the better wisdom of the new generation.\n\nTo preside is to wisely wait whilst the new generation becomes worthy of the position,\nand to quietly step down, and put whatever wisdom was discovered to the books of history.\n\nTo preside, means not, to continue repeating mistakes because they are on the books,\nand therefore one will not be punished.\n\nThere are only two sides to history, and only fools think it is the winning and the losing one,\nthe two sides as seen by future generations is the Wrong One, and The Noble One.\n\nLet us all rise to the challenges of wisdom,\nand making lasting and meaningful contributions to the Human Family.\n\nLet us not be lost to the wrong side,\nlet us not be passed over by the books of history,\nlet us help wisdom propagate.\n\nLet us stand up to every corner and every challenge,\nand let us speak out against the wrong, the mistakes, the incomplete, the unfinished.\n\nLet us not accept half measures, or good enough, or status quo,\nor the lowest common denominator minimums that get commited to law books.\n\nLet us remember who we are,\nand how Noble The Human Being.\n\nLet us stand upright,\nin Authenticity, Dignity, Wisdom and Compassion.\n\n\n[our humanity depends on everyone’s humanity]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2tOp7OxyQ8\n[Pirsig]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6IKu2wgm5I",

      "text": "We are not Island Universes scattered to no end in some void,\nwe are a part of a growing civilization with a past and a future.\n\nAnd we might have become confused about the Scope of Our Existence,\nwe stand divided by borders and committed to repeating history's mistakes.\n\nIt is unwise to pretend to be able to handle a great responsibility,\nonly desperation, fractures, and exploitation by other desperate pretenders can follow.\n\nThose who are granted authority are often not wise enough to handle it,\nand in their mediocrity they commit what in larger scope translates to real Crimes Against Humanity.\n\nThere cannot be wisdom without understanding and inheriting from past generations,\nthe transfer of knowledge occurs by means of Understanding Books.\n\nAnd there cannot be understanding without Authenticity,\nin haste of chasing a career there can only be memorization and misunderstanding.\n\nWe must keep in mind; that what the future generations do not perceive as clear progress,\nwill be seen as the continuation of dark ages with authorities on the wrong side of history.\n\nThe World United, is not a fairy-tale, nor should it be a mere dream for us,\nbut a Gift of Peace for The Future Generations, so that they may grow in Dignity, Health, and Wisdom.\n\nWe are neither disconnected from the future generations, nor the past generations,\nwe are a stepping stone in the development of The Human Kind.\n\nAnd we should recognize this Great Honor and Reward,\nand understand that the larger context is found in helping to build a better world for future generations.\n\nAll our decisions, across all levels and authorities,\nPolice, Attorneys and Judges, Parents, Teachers and Principals, Mayors, Governors, Prime Misters and Presidents, and everybody else...\n\nMust be mindful of future generations, of a growing world, of making lasting and meaningful contributions to the entire human kind,\na World that will eventually become united and free of borders.\n\nA world with future generations that will look back at us,\nright now, right here, with questions that we must present answers to.\n\nWe are getting stuck in circles,\nbecause people are forgetting history's lessons.\n\nBecause we are not thinking on a large enough scale,\nwe end up building more prisons rather than ending poverty with meaningful prevention programs.\n\nEndless cycles of heartless poverty that freeze the best of us,\npoverty that wouldn't even be a feature of modern society had we in our wisdom recognized it for what it is.\n\nPoverty denies people food and well being,\ncauses stress and great harm to mind and body.\n\nLove above Law, before we allow the practice of law,\nwe must end the cycles of poverty.\n\nMoney must not be used to limit people,\nit is meant to help.\n\nAnd how can a culture be to fail to see, how a young person allowed to build a business without the threat of homelessness and starvation,\nwill contribute back to the city and everyone's well being.\n\nWhat is so hard about seeing that rather than sending non-violent criminals to prison,\nwe can prevent their biggest mistakes by putting an end to their worries of sleeping hungry on the street.\n\nAny time, we fail to keep to reality,\nbe it sending a 15 year old lady to prison, or denying science, or tolerating arrests by obscured or unidentified agencies, or abuses of power or discretion.\n\nWe create fractures and distrust,\nblindly defacing and destroying work of many much wiser great beings, who gave their best trusting that we can carry on, in wisdom.\n\nWe must not move against the grain of reality,\nany and all divergence will only create a cascade of fractures that will demand constant attention\nand result in nothing more than systems that merely stand to support themselves and as an affront to justice and future generations.\n\nWhere there was once a solution as clear as helping children to inherit the wisdom of their elders,\nwe now see the emergence of a failed and impotent educational system with a mass incarceration backed.\n\nWisdom and inheritance of knowledge cannot be replaced by a \"fake it until you make it\" trickery,\nthe work of great beings must not be stained by people who fail to see their vision.\n\nOnce again, the world grows a generation at a time,\nthe education of the teenagers from 20 years ago is currently influencing the state of the world.\n\nLikewise, how we treat out children today,\nwill have a monumental impact on the world 20 years from now.\n\nLet us honor our children and all the future generations by encouraging them to books,\nby reminding them of the Great Power of Thinking Beings, of Philosophers and Lovers of Wisdom.\n\nBy reminding them that their Pursuit of Excellence,\ncan only make the world a better place for us all, and even those that are yet to come.\n\nLet us remind them that Books (and now Audio Books) serve as a wonderful source of our wisdom,\nespecially when read in a sequence that fits them best, and understood at thier own pace.\n\nLet us remind each other that we must reject short thinking and shortest paths,\nthat do not help the world grow and keep us divided.\n\nLet us break out of that selfish endless loop of repeating mistakes of past generations,\nby working towards a better world a more united world where we recognize each other as One Family.\n\nAnd let us remember that the great and wise beings of past generations,\ndemand that we honor hard won triumphs and do not repeat history's mistakes.\n\nThe very nature of that demand requires that once we take to wisdom,\nwe must stop following orders, and begin thinking, evaluating, and judging for ourselves.\n\nTo honor triumphs and guard against heartbreaking mistakes,\nis the duty we hold to those who came before us,\nand all the future generations that are yet to follow.\n\nAs children we are asked to listen and follow,\nas we grow we must learn to Lead and become Unbreakable.\n\nIt is not just the challenges of life that will test us,\nwe must also think and evaluate and reject that which is wrong.\n\nWe are constantly made to listen and expected to follow,\nlook behind any protest, or scandal, or angry headline.\n\nWe must judge all the contradictory information for ourselves,\nand make an informed decision as to whether or not majority is correct.\n\nLife will always challenge us,\nand My Goodness - times are always changing.\n\nHumanity is constantly bettering her self,\nwhat used to be acceptable - may now, be an affront to justice.\n\nAnd while there isn't enough time to comprehend all the books,\nthere is plenty of time to be come a Loving and Wise Compassionate Human Being,\n\nLet us remember that we are a chain-link between the Hard Work of Past Generations,\nand the United, Free from Poverty, and Peaceful Word of Future Generations.\n\nWe are One Growing Family, and that is the correct context for

Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning,\nbullies came after me when I was a chubby child.\n\nOne year sometime when I was 13 maybe,\nthe little me made the older me make a promise.\n\nI was to return to that damn classrom in my imagination,\nand sit right next to my younger self, and keep him company so that he is not scared anymore.\n\nI kept that promise,\nbut from time to time I also visit Dr. Frankl, I sit by his bed to keep him company too.\n\nThere is a very powerful description of Great Beings in his book,\nit is something that we should each remember.\n\n\"We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others,\ngiving away their last piece of bread.\n\nThey may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing:\nthe last of the human freedoms -- to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.\"\n\nThe book I have read the most times is \"A Short History of Nearly Everything\" by Bill Bryson,\nit is a book that begins with an honest journey to find out more about the world.\n\nIt is very helpful to realize that we don't know all the things we should know,\nand not be ashamed of that, just simply look for some Audio Books on the subject.\n\nI write this in 2020 in the middle of the Pandemic,\nand there is a lot of misled people, people who got taken in by false information.\n\nIn my memory Carl Sagan in his \"The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark\"\nmentions something similar on the subject of Aliens and UFOs.\n\nHe says that there is more beauty and interesting things in the actual Science,\nthan fantasizing stories of visiting aliens and flying saucers.\n\nWhen I was a teenager I was a huge fan of shows like the X-Files,\nand I remember walking into a mighty New York Public Library to crack the case, once and fall all,\n\nNut instead falling in love with Mokele-mbembe, I recognized the creature from my first Science book \"Wszechświat życie człowiek\" published in 1955,\nit was a Brontosaurus, and I instantly fell in love with the idea there there might be a few left in Rhodesia.\n\nFor the world to carry on becoming more and more United,\nwe have to become Great Lovers of Knowledge and take to Books and Audio Books.\n\nThe treasures withing are unlike anything we have heard of in school,\nthe books that we end up loving and carrying with us for the rest of our lives, make us better.\n\nAnd there is never an end to learning for real,\nevery few weeks a new book comes out that you didn't even know you were waiting for.\n\nIt becomes a source of Wisdom, or just sheer joy as the case is with Randall Munroe's\nWhat If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions.\n\nMy Dear Friends, I wish you the discovery of new poems, new quotes,\nnew books and video lectures, authors you will love for live and then some.\n\nAnd don't worry, the world is coming together, the borders are fading, and there is noting that can stop that,\nHumanity is in the process of Unifying to become One Loving Family.\n\nWe can hasten this process by learning, acquiring more knowledge,\npreventing history's mistakes from repeating themselves.\n\nThe path to the future is found In Knowledge and Wisdom,\nand aiming for Greatness of Soul, Heart, and Mind.\n\n\n[Mokele-mbembe]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mokele-mbembe",

we may turn around and begin moving in the opposite one.\n\nThe more we know, the better we navigate,\na powerful intermediate solution to this problem is Non-Fiction Audio Books,\nMemoirs and Biographies about Growing Up and Learning.\n\nThe Problem of Content of Culture, more specifically Cultural Indoctrination.\n\nIs in observations of the surrounding world,\nand hopes of living a meaningful existence in harmony with it.\n\nIf we are taught a falsehood about the world,\nwe will make decisions, of our own free will, that will be wrong.\n\nA good example of that is the propaganda of warring tribes or nations,\nteaching their children that the other is evil.\n\nIt is very difficult to catch ourselves as being under control of a cultural falsehood,\nwe tend to accept the culture we are born into, as a source of absolute truth.\n\nLet me give you an example,\nthat your mind will actively work to reject, paragraph by paragraph.\n\nWhen we went to school we were convinced it would teach us knowledge,\neven though nearly every month there was more and more evidence to the contrary.\n\nNo matter what,\nwe still believed.\n\nWe saw unfair grading, bullies and violence, hate, racism and indifference,\nwe saw that everyone was cheating by cramming, and that teachers loved it.\n\nWe saw many kids get into drugs and alcohol,\nsome of us even foresaw that some of the staff were predators looking for prey.\n\nWe accepted grades,\nand we accepted it as a measure of our intelligence.\n\nWe accepted grades, knowing about cheating by cramming, and knowing about unfair grading,\nwe still though of ourselves as B or C, or D level humans.\n\nIn the end we saw, that everything we gained, we gained by working on our own,\nand finally noticed that a diploma didn't even guarantee a well-paying job.\n\nLate on in life many of us noticed that many schools are not a source of knowledge,\nbut a source of regret, a force of erosion.\n\nMany of us became so confused, that we immediately assumed we were wrong,\nand never said a single bad thing about schools.\n\nThe tragedy of organized education,\nis a good example of the Overwhelming Power of Cultural Indoctrination.\n\nNow let us take a look at Authenticity and Pursuits of Excellence with a bit more detail, as those two combine to help with both\nThe Problem of Knowing Enough and The Problem of Cultural Indoctrination.\n\nAuthenticity.\n\nAccept authenticity the way you accepted Dignity, and Goodness, and Class.\nthat's how you become more sensitive to inconsistencies that are surrounding you.\n\nNext time you ask yourself, am I classy, and I a good person, am I a dignified person,\nalso ask; am I an authentic person that lives an authentic existence.\n\nDignity, and Goodness, and Class, are things we strengthen in our Soul and Heart as we grow,\nnow add Authenticity to help you see a little bit better.\n\nOften times when our intent is noble, but results end up wrong,\nit means that we were purposefully misled.\n\nWith Authenticity in our Heart,\nwe get an extra moment to ourselves.\n\nIn context of education, if a teacher is forcing you to cram for tests so you get good grades,\nyou are more likely to walk out and talk to the Dean, or Principal.\n\nNo longer will you feel compelled to cram,\nbecause it will feel inauthentic.\n\nAfter all, faking test results by means of cramming, or temporary memorization,\nis not what you intended when signing up for school, it is something you were pressured into.\n\nAuthenticity presents many more challenges in life than just going along with everyone else,\nbecause one of the strong points of moving along with the surrounding culture, is that it is easier to move with the flow and play by the rules.\n\nHowever, the price we pay for ease,\nis that we don't really learn anything, we just pretend to learn.\n\nPursuits of Excellence are by definition difficult, and challenging, however they result in Real Knowledge, a Real Functional Education.\nYou start with Audio Books, Video Lectures, Survey Courses and learn with whatever means are at your disposal.\n\nThis is more challenging, than cramming for tests,\nbut this is not difficult because you are working with material you love, with knowledge that touches and moves you.\n\nThe reward for Standing in Relentless Pursuit of Excellence and Authentic Achievement,\nis the Complete Knowledge of the subject you Love.\n\nIf that takes you to a Science, Medical, Technology or Engineering School,\nor a Startup Accelerator, or your own company from zero.\n\nThen you are faced with a much smaller challenge, there is no more cramming, or pretending,\nas you are now filled with Athletic Knowledge from across thousands of books.\n\nKnowledge that you connected in a sequence that served you best,\nand at a pace that helped you retain most.\n\nAuthenticity and Pursuits of Excellence,\nput us on a path to becoming Wiser Beings.\n\nThey will help you see in a world obscured by indoctrination,\nor one that lacks real education.\n\n\n[tragedy of organized education]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCbdS4hSa0s\n[Startup Accelerator]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=What+is+a+Startup+Accelerator",

poor kids to learn.\n\nBut we did it,\nwe did it, it worked.\n\nIt will always work,\nwe learn to write, to read, numbers.\n\nAnd multiplication, here is when teachers make the mistake of memorization,\nwhere they look down on the ability to create a multiplication table,\na delayed addition lookup table.\n\nHere, a new kind of memorization begins,\nthe kind that destroy our climate, our health, our very humanity.\n\nThe moment, the teacher, says, MEMORIZE,\nthey are now working on getting paid.\n\nThis is where school breaks down,\nwhere it all falls apart.\n\nIn the worst way, now, a lookup table, is a shameful cheat-sheet, it becomes a D+ or a 2+ and it stains,\nand it shows up in College papers, all the papers, all the worthless papers.\n\nAnd this would be fine, except it stains our minds as well,\nbecause deep down we believe even in the worst teachers.\n\nAnd that belief, in that memorization grade charade,\ndigs into us, and books start feeling optional, and math useless.\n\nChildren grow up without faith in Education and Knowledge,\nthey don't believe in the Power of Wisdom, and Noble Teachers and Guardians.\n\nThey are still geniuses, powerfully smart, but the betterment of Humanity,\nis not the aim, the aim is to prove that they can do whatever it is.\n\nAnd we lose a child, a student, and gain something else.\n\nThe teachers, sold the world,\nfor a small paycheck.\n\nWe can fix this.\n\nFirst of all, your grades were nonsense,\nall the things you couldn't memorize well enough were not a judgment of your intelligence,\nit was a judgment of how well you perform circus tricks, how deep your faith in teachers.\n\nYou were a Genius,\nwe all are, there is no anomaly that grans us magical brains,\nit is a function of NOT MEMORIZING, and looking at how the formulas were invented.\n\nYou master match by studying its history,\nnot by memorizing formulas.\n\nImagine what would happen to Newton,\nif he only memorized formulas.\n\nImagine reading a foreign storybook that way,\njust memorizing pronunciation of word after word without learning the language first.\n\nThe language for Mathematics is not numbers,\nit is love of Universe, of Complexity, search for answers,\ngaining insight into the working of the universe, by subtle analogy to the simplified mechanics behind mathematics.\n\nIt is a lovely, but primitive language that can be brought to life with computers,\nprogramming, game development, even design.\n\nPast a certain point, people didn't know how to teach,\nso they used memorization, out of desperation.\n\nMemorization temporarily acts like learning, knowing,\nthe effects wear off in days, where knowledge is the foundation of the heights we reach.\n\nGrades are fake,\nyou go tricked,\nsold for a paycheck.\n\nMost of the sciences are learned by studying their history,\nthere is no memorization, there is no memorization, there is no memorization.\n\nJust beautiful little notes, journals, lookup tables,\nincluding the multiplication table, but also all the tables you invent.\n\nWe are all geniuses,\nsome take the easy road, and lie, and trick, and manipulate, and pretend, and try to fake it until they make it.\n\nOthers,\ntry to make money, keep bringing a paycheck home, keep lying, get the funding, lower the test standards, process the kids so that all get paid.\n\nWe are vulnerable this way,\nwe tend to believe people in authority.\n\nEven the ones that reject it,\nalso reject the idea that they are smart.\n\nA mind that rejects memorization in favor of integrity, or authenticity,\nshows beauty, shows a love of life.\n\nGenius is just the beginning,\npast the Sweet Elementary that I know we all love, we only have books.\n\nThere is a lot of Audio Books, a Lot of Mighty Lectures,\nbut you have to reach out for that.\n\nTo do that,\nyou can't just hear me saying it;\n\nYou have to believe that You were a Genius All Along,\nit was just some desperate pretenders along the way trying to put food on their table that tricked you.\n\nI know how to help you regain Faith in Education,\nI want you to begin at Concord, Massachusetts, Walden Pond.\n\nI want you, I command you to go see Henry,\ngo now it matters not that it is not Spring.\n\nYou will go back to greet him many times,\ngo see Henry, at the Walden Pond.\n\nTake a rock, from where you are at right now,\nand add it to the pile that's already there.\n\nThoreau, in return will help you slow down,\nand calm down, he will help you come to a speed that's necessary for audio books.\n\nYou are going to go to England soon,\nyou are headed for Westminster Abbey.\n\nYou are going to visit Sir Isaac.\nhe will help you understand that Knowledge comes from within.\n\nTake a long time to listen,\nunderstand that you are more than a genius,\nyou are a creator.\n\nWith the Insight granted by Sir Isaac Newton,\nand the Peace and Calm bestowed upon you by Henry David Thoreau.\n\nYou will find your beginning anew,\nyou will return to the point where you got tricked into thinking that you are not a genius.\n\nAnd finally,\nlet your journey begin at Springer Mountain in Georgia, or Mount Katahdin in Maine,\nthe others need help, they need to accept the responsibility for their own self education as well.\n\nPlease, take many years to section hike the Appalachian Trail,\nhere Mother Nature and The Kindness of Strangers, and Trail Magic will be your teacher.\n\nListen, Read, and Write.\n\nWrite to get to know yourself, write to figure out the best way to learn,\nwrite to inspire a generation after a generation to make it to their rightful place, as Genius and Creator.\n\nTogether We Can Fix It All.\n\n\n[here Mother Nature and The Kindness of

      "text": "It started Christmas 2020, the world was already in trouble;\nthe conjecture in a sentence was this:\n\n\"What can be corrupted will be corrupted, and there are no fully operational public institutions anywhere\",\nit is too easy for bad people to, not just subvert, but erase lifetimes of hard work and dedication.\n\nIt is commonly known as corruption, but that didn't matter to them,\nbecause they were not attempting to fix things, they had an idea how to replace everything.\n\nAnd by everything,\nthey meant institutions all around the world.\n\nThey were going to begin in the beginning, Henry Ford once said,\n\"If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.\",\n\nThe idea was that if they went to the Courts, Police or Schools,\nthey would have wanted the wrong things, that would only invite more problems.\n\nInitially nobody knew how immune to corruption the thing was going to be,\nbut there was a way to find out.\n\nThe thing was a game, it was meant to be a simulation of a city,\nit was a simple program that used simple web design principles to simulate a city.\n\nThe non playable characters, were little bots that would interact with the player,\nthe bots were crafted to simulate officials, and they interacted with web pages the way a user would.\n\nSo part of the reason why the programming was so simple,\nis that bots needed a simple way to pretend to be humans.\n\nWhen everything went online players would sign up to take over for the bots,\nand some of the initial testing was about corrupting the institutions of the city.\n\nThe thinking was that, if it was not possible for players to corrupt an institution,\nthen the program could replace all the management software of a real city.\n\nTo their surprise there was a number of cities that were willing to participate in the trials,\nit took them a better part of a decade to get everything going, but the initial trials worked.\n\nThey knew that they became famous,\nwhen the UN wouldn't stop calling.\n\nIt worked because they kept insisting on simplicity,\nthey kept using bots, and corruption simulation teams for decades.\n\nThe program was adopted by almost all the cities of the world,\nabout 10,000 running copies.\n\nWhat was fascinating about this,\nis that it was still played as a game.\n\nThere was a Virtual Cyberpunk City,\nthat everyone went to for internet news.\n\nThe program relies on plain HTTP, REST, and HTML\nand to make it operate well on $30 Android Tablets it uses little client-side scripting.\n\nIt is a Virtual City at heart,\nbut when players start mapping out real homes, and roads, and the citizens join in,\nit inflates to become a virtual representation of a real city.\n\nPeople can vote in elections, and there is no real threat of corruption here,\nbecause their voting history is under their profile.\n\nElections, that was one of the things that got a huge upgrade in many of the cities around the world,\nsome cities just vote on ideas that need to get done, they don't vote on representatives anymore.\n\nThe program as a whole,\neliminated the need for representatives.\n\nPeople vote on issues that need immediate attention,\nand those are the first issues that get solved.\n\nTwo amazing things emerged from within the program,\nschools begun working for the students by providing them with Audio Books, Lectures, and Chat (that's what the teachers are called),\nand the trail of programs that students select over the course of their teenage years actually becomes their resume.\n\nSchools started working,\nit was Rebirth and Enlightenment of both the citizens and the cities.\n\nThe second,\npeople could work on tasks logged by the users of the program.\n\nSome tasks like taking care of public gardens could result in users getting monthly tips from their community,\npeople loved being able to give the lady down the street $8/mo. for making sure all the flower beds were taken care of,\nthe lady next door was often bringing in $3,200 per month for something that she would do anyway, people loved her.\n\nOther tasks like road work, could get a bounty, bounties basically ensured that all the road work was done,\nany competent company could claim a task and grab the bounty for a pothole.\n\nPeople would setup an tiny Limited Liability Company and stock up on compatible materials, and wait for roadwork tasks,\nthere were no more delays to get things done, and these bounties could grow fast.\n\nAll this was tested in the games before cities adopted the program,\nso everyone knew what they were getting, and the stuff just worked.\n\nThere was an interesting phenomenon where automated programs would actually stay in place of people,\none of the most well know instances dealt with the prison population, in a small Swiss city.\n\nThe entire process was often ran by bots,\ncity was able to vote on presets, this eliminated the need for many local Judges.\n\nIn this particular instance all the folks who got into fights,\nwere automatically given community service, duration of which would increase with each repeated offense under the same category,\nthe community service program was actually a well paying program, the users didn't want people to go to jail,\nthey wanted the troublemakers to get a job.\n\nWords like felon and criminal were not used, people in the community had access to their entire education,\nthey could see into hearts and souls of these users, the books, pursuits, and curiosities of their teenage years were right there.\n\nPsychologists were able to build up a new spectrum disorder, that emerged from stress, loss, fear, isolation.\n\nThe Swiss town actually ended up closing most of it's prisons.\n\nIn America, a similar system of automated programs resulted in a lot of convictions being overturned.\n\nThis was a prison management system where the inmates were able to present their case in a way that the citizens would understand from a more humane perspective,\nagain the entire past of that person was right there, tragedies and loss, and stress would be followed by more misfortune, deteriorating mental condition, desperate self medication\nto get back to a thinking state, and what was once called a Felon or Criminal, once again became a Human, a Brother, a Son, a Daughter, a Mother.\n\nPrison population dropped.\n\nNobody called this program a game,\nit was always meant to change the world.\n\nThe cities were always connected together to form a larger Global Metropolis,\noriginally it helped people with jobs, as users could tell where they could find tasks that fit them best,\n\nBut now, decades after the initial release;\nthe program begun uniting the world.\n\nWar, for one became unthinkable,\nas people could see how the well being of even one city affected all the others.\n\nThere was no such thing as not having a job,\nthe cities always needed help with countless tasks.\n\nCorruption had nowhere to hide, the crooked politicians had nowhere to hide,\nnational borders made little economic sense, and Climate Change stopped being an issue by 2030.\n\nNot that they cared for rewards, but The Women behind the program,\nthe original programmers, received Purple Hearts and multiple Nobel Peace Prizes.\n\nWhat they did love was the fact that the United Nations

WikiWiki,\nhas absolutely solved the problem of starting in the beginning.\n\nWith just a few lines of code he opened the gateway to content creation,\nin the most simplest way possible.\n\nThey already knew how to solve the problem of two users editing the same file at the same time,\nthe inspiration for that came from CouchDB.\n\nIn short, a unit of disk information in the first Cosmopolis was not a file,\nit was a directory, with randomly named files prefixed with a version number.\n\nFor example, detroit/15-aabbd.txt, detroit/15-xyxx.txt\n\nThe brilliant thing about this is that when two people save version 15 at the same time,\nthe random name of the file decides which version 15 is used, via a simple alphanumeric sort.\n\nIf there are 32 people editing the same file, and they

had its first article,\ncosmopolis now held the first city: http://localhost:3000/view/night_city\n\nThis was both exiting and terrifying, this program was meant to bring peace to the world.\nand they only had a blank page for an imaginary city.\n\nAdding user support had to come in next,\njust like every city had a page, so did every user.\n\nThus, Night City would receive its first two citizens,\nAlice and Bob.\n\nOut in the server room the admin was already preparing for corruption simulations,\nand she named the malicious politician Mallory.\n\nAlice and Bob represented computer programs,\nthey were chatbots.\n\nHowever, the bots are separate programs that use Cosmopolis like a user would,\nthey would log in, check messages, scan for phrases they recognize and then perform some task within Cosmopolis.\n\nThe bots weren't really inspired by anything other than old MUD programs but there was a beautiful line of code,\nthat one of the leads always looked at, line 26 in a sample script of github's hubot.\n\nThe bots were special,\nthey greatly simplified simulations and reasoning about this virtual test city.\n\nAs a whole they already created a very simple,\nbut living simulation.\n\nFor example one internal bot would be responsible for generating weather in Night City,\nthe bot actually got its information from Detroit's own weather service.\n\nAnd our virtual Alice had a setting in her profile,\nthat would alert her when it was raining, she would then equip an umbrella before leaving for work.\n\nBots gave Cosmopolis that early life,\nthat made working on the system fun.\n\nBut by far the most special thing about bots,\nwas that they could be replaced by a real human,\nby a person that would turn off the bot and log in into their account.\n\nIn the next release of the program,\nthe girls focused on enhancing this feature.\n\nA bot could be instructed to ship groceries from Amazon,\nbut when a real person took over for an account,\nthey could go to a local store and buy and deliver the groceries for a small payment.\n\nEven in the early tests, it was becoming more an more obvious,\nthat a powerful automated framework that could help people make money could be built.\n\nAs with every program the girls were worried about its adoption,\nbut it was universally agreed that people would join to make money,\nand in the end large cities would go online within weeks,\nbecause it helped people put food on the table by trading small services.\n\nCosmopolis 2.0 was what got the attention of United Nations,\nbut that is a story for another time.\n\nPersonal Note,\n\nBecoming a programmer is not that hard, and when you have a dream like our story of Cosmopolis here,\nit becomes a fun hobby that you just aimlessly poke at when there is some time in a day.\n\nThere is a tradition of creating Programming Cook-books, they are books tailored for a specific language,\nthat contain short recipes, and it is really fun to flip through it, and see what this programming thing is about.\n\nI recommend learning JavaScript, which is currently called ES2020, to actually execute a program you will need an interpreter.\n\nYour browser has one built in, as JavaScript is the language of the web, look up how to open the web console in your browser of choice.\n\nThe industry standard for server-side JavaScript applications like

      "text": "At first they laughed, then they called them a cult,\nthen accused them of corruption, and when it was all over,\nmost called them The Founding Mothers.\n\nWe didn't live under a threat of Nuclear War,\nthe models predicted the war as 100% certain.\n\nThis is what happens, when one generation passes onto the next,\nMutually Assured Destruction.\n\nIt didn't take computer models,\nit didn't require an imagination,\nwar only needs time, guns and borders.\n\nFor uneducated humans, war is a certainty,\nwar is where we all come from.\n\nThe models predicted that it would take decades,\nnearly a century to reach a stable disarmament.\n\nOne of the greatest problems that Humanity faces is born of group cohesion,\nwhen we lived in tribes automatic self-indoctrination ensured tribe stability.\n\nWhen the world connected,\naccepting the cultures and beliefs of the local group we were born into, divided us from the rest creating a border.\n\nThe threat of nuclear war grew, and it was not disarmament,\nbut leaving all the bad ideas behind, that would make all the difference.\n\nAbandoning invisible indoctrination and leaving imperceptibly-bad ideas behind,\ncan only occur on generation by generation level.\n\nThe generations with cultures holding bad ideas needed to retire out of old age,\nand a more realistic, more educated, wiser and humane culture, was to take over.\n\nNo abrupt changes could be made without conflict,\nout of love for all Life and Humanity this was the first project to require over a hundred years of work.\n\nAnd so sweetly, one of the girls said, that this would require the work of a League,\nThe League of Extraordinary Ladies, another one jokingly proclaimed in a grumbly tone.\n\nAnd the Universe,\ndid smile.\n\nThe models revealed that Political Borders and Nationalism in a Nation armed with Nuclear Weapons,\nwould result in a high probability of a Nuclear War, as each generation is indoctrinated into the worst ideas of the previous.\n\nThe most terrifying model prediction was that as more and more got lost in translation between consecutive generations,\nthe probability of nuclear war approached 100%.\n\nAnd as all Heroines do, The League of Extraordinary Ladies,\nset off on a multi-generational promise, to save the world.\n\nThe weakness, of the ease with which we accept the culture we are born into as true and perfect,\nwas going to be addressed by a novel educational program creatively named the Global Progressive Advancement (GPA).\n\nVolunteers would create free, open, unbranded, library of audio books out of works in public domain,\nand the website would stitch these works together into Audio Lectures with the aid of speakers, poets and teachers.\n\nCelebrities, well known authors, and even movie stars would contribute their time, voice and patience,\nto create what became the greatest work of art, that by far exceeded even the most romantic descriptions of the Library of Alexandria.\n\nA number of authors donated their works to the school,\nstudents participating in the free self-paced open-curriculum school had access to Carl Sagan, Bill Bryson, Neil deGrasse Tyson, and pretty much all the others.\n\nBy 2050, it was the only school taken seriously,\nbecause it was the only school that resulted in students showing great results.\n\nThe school brought the world together in Knowledge and Wisdom,\nand as predicted in less than a 150 years from the initial inception, the borders fell.\n\nA new, and more informed, nuclear disarmament program was born,\nthat decades after resulted in cessation of weapons manufacturing of all kind throughout Europe and Asia.\n\nThese seemingly fantastic, impossible goals of world peace,\nwere achieved by helping Humanity converge on wisdom by means of books made more accessible by narrators.\n\nProviding superior education to the children of a nation,\nwhilst letting their parents live out culture they were born into,\nis a form of Infinite Kindness, it is a form of Love.\n\nRather than the children inheriting just the culture of their parents and the nation they were born to,\nby participating in the Global Progressive Advancement program, they also inherited the best ideas and wisdom from Humanity's most beloved books.\n\nWorld Peace was reached by taking advantage of our susceptibility to cultural indoctrination,\nto blindly and without a question accepting ideas of the world we are born into,\nthis was not a trick, but much needed medicine and vaccine that prevented mutually assured destruction.\n\nWe simply added Knowledge and Wisdom,\nto the culture and spirit of times, to all the nations.\n\nThe first and foremost force of the educational program was not knowledge,\nit was Reality, something that corruption and decay is incapable of using for its advantage.\n\nThe reality of the human condition is that we all yearn for wisdom,\nand meaning, and love, and kinship and belonging.\n\nIt mattered not if it was two boys that Father Gregory Boyle was raising,\nor two nations that hated each other in starvation for wisdom.\n\nOnce they had access to wisdom,\nreality helped to unravel their misunderstandings and helped them grow.\n\nThe League of Extraordinary Ladies didn't stop at Nuclear Disarmament,\ntheir granddaughters ended poverty.\n\nThey did so by, now the age old tradition of using weakness to fight weakness,\nthey ended poverty by means of poverty.\n\nIt was a micro management, and micro payment transaction platform,\ndistributed on smart tablets that helped communities of the world trade services.\n\nThe adoption of the platform was hastened by the fact that no money was made from these transactions by the hosting company,\nif someone needed a car ride, or grocery delivery, housework, or a tutor to help their kids with math, there was always someone ten minutes away that would help.\n\nOne of the untended features of this program was local pantry,\na feature originally intended for trading foodstuffs, that later became a place to feed the hungry.\n\nThe trading platform also helped to place the homeless in unused hotels and apartments,\nin such a way that they had easy access to care takers, teachers, therapists and a chance at a better future.\n\nIt is hard to say what prevented Humanity as a whole from coming together like these friends did,\nbut it is easy to see that it was internet that helped communities collaborate and communicate better.\n\nWe needed programs to help us talk to each other,\nand cut out the middle men.\n\nWe needed programs that helped cities become more independent,\nand stop relying on the state and nation that by contrast meant little.\n\nAnd we needed to begin thinking in decades,\nin centuries.\n\nBecause our problems, do not end with us,\nand what we leave behind is easily misunderstood.\n\nWhat was originally created as a deterrent, come future, in chaos, in poverty, in haste,\ngiven all that is lost in translation, will eventually become the tool that it really is.\n\n\n[Father Gregory Boyle]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipR0kWt1Fkc",

Today, the only reason why the old ways are still in place,\nis because low quality schools are continuing to try to stay in business - this is evil.\n\nToday, with the help of computers, smart phones and tablets,\ninteractive/open curricula, online lectures, Audio Books, and internet,\nit is possible to approach each student individually,\nI am sure there are online schools that are trying to do just that.\n\nThere is no excuse for why anybody should have less than an A, or a 4.0 GPA,\nthat is what being in school is about, learning, and when you have learned, you get an A.\n\nEven now, I can't see everything that has gone wrong,\nschools have become a bit less unforgiving, I am sure.\n\nBut even so, the fact remains,\ntoday schools can't teach.\n\nThey are wicked good,\nat tricking students into thinking that they are not smart enough for good grades.\n\nAt the end of the day,\nyou will still need an education.\n\nYour only safe bet,\nis becoming self taught,\nindependent study.\n\nAnd please, don't let anybody call you a Genius,\nhelp others, help them find knowledge too.\n\nFinally,\nI describe this tragedy to the best of my abilities,\non a tired mind, some things have slipped, others are out of shape, please forgive me.\n\nBut, I do know one thing for certain,\nthis is not a standing tragedy that will remain forever.\n\nThis is a call for heroism,\nfor courage, and courage calls to courage everywhere.\n\nThis is how Life asks for help,\nyou are now being challenged to stand up to mediocrity, to lies.\n\nBecome a Great Being,\nFix Schools.\n\nPersonal note,\n\nHere is a short list of my favorite science popularizes.\n\nBill Bryson\nRichard Dawkins\nSam Harris\nPZ Myers\nLawrence Krauss\nLord Martin Rees\nJill Tarter\nSeth Shostak\nAlex Filippenko\nSean Carroll\nJared Diamond\nHoward Zinn\n\n\n[Panama Papers]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_Papers\n[you will still need an education]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGoZZvfEd6A",
