Florida Keys, US Highway One.</p><p>If you live in Florida, then you are headed for Michigan&apos;s Upper Peninsula.<br>\n  If you live West, your destination is all the way East.</p><p>It is not the destination, it is the Journey, my Friend.<br>\n  Take your time, watch the cage crumble and fade as you go.</p><p>Only the important things, will stay.<br>\n  And you&apos;ll get to see yourself again.</p><p>And you&apos;ll get to be free again,<br>\n  you will resume where you left of.</p><p>A life of bondage,<br>\n  is not worthy of you.</p><p>Life is not meant to be a cage, or cruel, or frighten you.<br>\n  You knew this as a child, and you let that slip away, not even noticing when it went.</p><p>It is your Right to resist being pushed into places that you don&apos;t want to be in.<br>\n  It is your Right to reject conditions that you never agreed to, that you were pushed into.</p><p>How else can the Universe be worthy of us, how else can our lives be beautiful.<br>\n  Heaven and Paradise are real, but they are now, right now. Now.</p><p>How can people love you, when your own love for yourself is slipping away.<br>\n  You have to. You have to accept the responsibility for your Health, and Dignity.</p><p>You don&apos;t have to make it all the way, the first time,<br>\n  and you don&apos;t have to leave your phone behind.</p><p>You can call this therapy, or a vision quest, you can call it a road trip.<br>\n  You are not allowed to live in a cage, of whatever constitution, that will make you ill.</p><p>It comes to you naturally to take care of your body,<br>\n  but your mind also requires care.</p><p>When you reach your Freedom, you&apos;ll know what to do next,<br>\n  it can be another trip, East, or West.</p><p>If you feel trapped, the Universe is darker for it.<br>\n  Take a week. Or two. Forty days is best. call it your Quarantine.</p><p>Unless you clear you mind, and focus on what is important,<br>\n  on you and those worthy of your care, you will lose it.</p><p>You will forget the beautiful person you truly are,<br>\n  you will fall from heaven, and forget about paradise.</p><p>And life will turn into a black and white TV show.<br>\n  You must take good care of your mind.</p><p>If there is no one else that cares about you,<br>\n  then look at this poem.</p><p>I care.<br>\n  Hi!</p><p>I am, speaking for you!<br>\n  grab the keys, or bicycle, or comfy shoes, and go.</p><p>Go, and never again, let go.</p><p>Your health is important.<br>\n  Your well being is important.</p><p>A Human Being is Meant to Learn,<br>\n  A Human Being is Meant to Rise.</p><p>You are meant to filled with Wisdom,<br>\n  with Joy and Love of Life.</p><p>You are meant to Laugh,<br>\n  Truly Fully Laugh.</p><p>Listen to me, there is more.<br>\n  You Are Meant To Become A Great Being.</p>"

us.</p><p>We&apos;ll also find a force of opposition,<br>\n  it will keep our minds tired.</p><p>It will be unclear why life seems strange,<br>\n  why everything takes so much more to see.</p><p>Why we seem to lack confidence,<br>\n  or how everyone else has so much of it.</p><br><p>But, the most troubling thing, my Dear Friends,<br>\n  is in how easy it is to diverge.</p><p>There is a place for Leaps of Faith in life,<br>\n  they are quite sacred, and as beautiful.</p><p>But, to fill in a stranger&apos;s blanks,<br>\n  or trust that the others know what they are doing.</p><p>To listen to good advice that considers you naught,<br>\n  or give something up of your self, and not know why.</p><p>To go to a place because everyone went there,<br>\n  to bow because all others bowed.</p><p>That is not sacred, sacrilegious maybe,<br>\n  you must never follow, you must always lead.</p><br><p>Even more troubling is how it all collapses,<br>\n  not with a bang, but a stupid sick whimper:</p><p>&quot;How were they supposed to know&quot;,<br>\n  &quot;How was I supposed to know?&quot;</p><p>All the blame for what others did,<br>\n  to Your Sacred Self, somehow falls back right on you.</p><p>And then it turns out,<br>\n  your lesson is all over cheap paperbacks.</p><p>Everyone has been trough this,<br>\n  and none were the wiser.</p><p>All those confident faces and smiles, were faked,<br>\n  and the more convincing they try to be, the less they are in pain.</p><br><p>When someone is putting you at risk,<br>\n  take a split second to imagine them saying:</p><p>&quot;How was I supposed to know?&quot;, and stand your ground.<br>\n  You are not to follow, you are to lead.</p><p>Let them have have their stupid games, and drinks, temporary

the world the shapes.</p><p>How can your other half recognize you,<br>\n  when you are traveling on some other path.</p><br><p>What you many not do, is to start at the bottom,<br>\n  all those cheap novels, they describe starting at the zero.</p><p>Start where all the heroes left off,<br>\n  read a handful of novels, and move on to their Memoirs.</p><p>Your life depends on knowing what it is and where to start,<br>\n  and what to avoid.</p><p>It will get lonely, yes.<br>\n  You&apos;ll be lonely because you don&apos;t drink, and don&apos;t do stupid things.</p><p>You&apos;ll be lonely, but, You&apos;ll be You,<br>\n  you will shine your own light, and. you. will. be. seen.</p><br><p>Get up, step up,<br>\n  create and speak with art, and you&apos;ll talk with the world.</p><p>Grab pencils, trace with an Office Projector,<br>\n  and bring your Tortillon along.</p><p>At the gym, dance,<br>\n  your way is the only way.</p><p>You may get lonely,<br>\n  but for long.</p><br><p>Try to help people learn, what you have learned,<br>\n  become an assistant, a tutor, and a substitute teacher.</p><p>Keep track of your Peace Corps application,<br>\n  just keep adding to it, keep re-sending it.</p><p>They probably don&apos;t read it until version 50, anyway.<br>\n  It gives you time to revise and refine the ideas.</p><p>To begin walking your own path,<br>\n  is to enter, The

find an Audiobook about it.</p><p>Stay sharp, stay fit,<br>\n  endurance training goes well with Audiobooks, and Love of Wisdom.</p><p>Others must have no influence on you,<br>\n  this is not their

still very young,<br>\nbarely know of the world.\n\nAnd already the question of harmony comes,<br>\nand in harmony we learn, and thrive.\n\nAway from it, we'll be interrupted,<br>\nand feel lost in the void.\n\nIt is a simple choice,<br>\nbut out minds are not ready to make it.\n\nOften we forget.\n\nWe forget about our little gardens,<br>\nand all the little walks.\n\nWe forget how amazing it felt,<br>\nto stand on the wing of a plane.\n\nWe forget the taste of popcorn at the Zoo,<br>\nor even how enormous Zoo felt.\n\nWe forget pebbles at the river,<br>\nand mischievous squires at the park.\n\n<br>\n\nThat little dog with a bark,<br>\nthat scaredy kitten always hiding in the dark.\n\nOur collection of unused keys,<br>\nand the box of bottle caps we collected with ease.\n\nWe forgot our Lego and the old bike,<br>\nwith that seat that we used to really like.\n\nWe don't remember the Palaces and Castles,<br>\nthat we used to love, and those swords, that fit us like a glove.\n\n<br>\n\nEverybody else came around,<br>\nacting like they know the ground.\n\nBut, this was our gift from the Universe,<br>\nan affinity for flowering gardens, and little passage ways, and all those flying planes.\n\nIt was a key to unlock our mind,<br>\nto understand the zoo, and our size in the universe, connect with pebbles at the beach.\n\nIt is a pathway that fits us best,<br>\nto love little creatures, and collect some shineys, and build with blocks, and ride far and wide.\n\nIt was to remind us,<br>\nto find our place among Great Beings, and study and pursue excellence, in all we do.\n\n<br>\n\nThen they sent us to First Grade,<br>\nand the weird kid peed into the Duplo, they didn't even have Lego.\n\nThen the teacher graded you down for counting pebles in your pocket,<br>\nand did it so many times, you lost track.\n\n<br>\n\nThere was a whisper about the pebbles,<br>\nit was Mr. Sagan - \"You are made of Star Stuff.\"\n\nAnd then the kids whispered...<br>\nto push you in the mud.\n\n<br>\n\nPush their laughter aside,<br>\nyou'll need to Learn, and learn really hard.\n\nCause right now, you're in the mud,<br>\nand you need to hang on.\n\nIt will get worse,<br>\nbut all you have to do is rise.\n\nEach time,<br>\nyou'll rise higher.\n\n(When in trouble, call the Police it is OK for kids to call the Police, they'll love helping you, don't be scared.)\n\n<br>\n\nThird Grade,<br>\nFifth Grade.\n\nLow grade,<br>\nUhh, but there can't be higher.\n\nBecause by this time, you're getting bad grades,<br>\nbecause the teacher thinks you're copying from somewhere.\n\nThe bullies know,<br>\nyou did it on your own.\n\nSaw you pacing for days,<br>\nwith your first program.\n\nKeep going forward,<br>\ndon't let go - you're doing great, stay away from the hate.\n\n<br>\n\nBy the time you're out of Eight Grade,<br>\nby rejecting crazy, and nonsense, and stupid, and lazy, you graduate above all others.\n\nBecause you didn't follow,<br>\nbecause you chose to study on your own, at your own pace.\n\nBecause worthless grades meant nothing,<br>\nyou felt no stress.\n\nBecause, you didn't follow<br>\nnothing could hurt you.\n\nAnd your world is yours,<br>\ntruly-truly yours.\n\n<br>\n\nWe unravel, when we forget who we are,<br>\nthe moment we hide, or pretend, or follow.\n\nAnd, gosh darn it,<br>\nit happens when we are still kids.\n\nWe are completely unprepared,<br>\nand none will help.\n\n<br>\n\nSo you! have to keep it together,<br>\nyou can't let anyone hurt your mind.\n\nIn High School, the pretenders make a sudden appearance,<br>\nnever held a book in their hand.\n\nThe back of Hamlet,<br>\nall the quotes have more IQ.\n\nLet the little Caesars,<br>\nkeep the wind from the hall away.\n\nYou need to pace your reading at the library,<br>\nteach yourself focus.\n\nDon't EVER! finish the books,<br>\njust get to the part that is valuable to you, and skip the rest.\n\n<br>\n\nStart working on your start-up early,<br>\nit is a study in failure.\n\nYou need to create a series of CONTROLLED FAILURES,<br>\nthis is very important.\n\nLearn [content management][1],<br>\nand figure out [billing][2]\n\nThat's your surface platform,<br>\nand think about nature of business.\n\nNever try to build things directly,<br>\nfacilitate the building of direct things for others.\n\nHelp them setup,<br>\nso that you are not burdened, and keep going.\n\nLook at the structure of start-up accelerators, or even banks,<br>\nthey take a percent, and never create what will weigh them down.\n\nEventually, you can build your own Tesla,<br>\nbut at first, you start with services.\n\nLook at the gym,<br>\nmonthly subscription, is most stable.\n\nThe lessons, are all around you.\n\n<br>\n\nYou don't need college,<br>\nbut taking college classes is very relaxing.\n\nMake sure you get a 4.0 at each class,<br>\nbe ready to repeat it.\n\nAnd enjoy,<br>\nthe lectures.\n\nCollege is just a toy,<br>\nit looks bad on your Portfolio, so hide it.\n\nIt is a very weak teaching experience,<br>\nand people know that there there is minimal learning involved.\n\nJumping from high school to start-ups is more impressive,<br>\nand shows that you chose knowledge over nonsense.\n\nIt shows that you chose to learn on your own,<br>\nto take care of your own mind,<br>\nrather than to pretend to learn for grades.\n\nAuthenticity is very important in life,<br>\nit is hard to connect with people that role play.\n\n<br>\n\nBonding with people that are just acting,<br>\nis only functional for as long as they are acting.\n\nBut it is never good,<br>\neventually they'll have a crisis, similar to a mid-life crisis.\n\nStay Authentic,<br>\nkeep to to those who are Authentic.\n\nBe safe.\n\n<br>\n\nWhen it feels like everyone else is having an amazing life,<br>\nand you are stuck.\n\nUmm... that not true\n\nBut it is also not healthy to think this way about yourself,<br>\nyou are not beneath the party goers, they don't have what you have in your mind.\n\n<br>\n\nBut, that's far enough,<br>\ntime to get some rest.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is where it gets interesting,<br>\nyou have primed your mind for Business.\n\nThat is a fine first step,<br>\nnow you need to get ready for the real graduation.\n\nYou need to section hike the equivalent of the Appalachian Trail,<br>\nand measure your jogging a hundred miles at a time.\n\nSection jogging, the Western States 100.\n\nMind and Body, for the rest of your life.\n\nYou must take good care of both.\n\n<br>\n\nAt mile fifty, halfway through a run,<br>\nas you piece together your blurry thoughts of your next business.\n\nTake some time to understand what it is that College Grads have,<br>\nthose are very brittle relationships, and inflexible careers.\n\nWe all feel the promise, but we can't fake it,<br>\nit would be the opposite, and certainly not worthy of you, my Friends.\n\nYou can only find your meaning in Authenticity,<br>\nshortcuts will only take you back to the beginning.\n\nTo live among the Extraordinary,<br>\nyou must become Extraordinary yourself.\n\n<br>\n\nThe gateway to Meaning of Life,<br>\nis in that tiny moment when you think to your self:\n\n\"I am not going to jog tonight, I need rest.\"\n\nRight there in that dot,<br>\nis the keyhole,<br>\nto the key that you are,<br>\nto the gateway that you need to open.\n\nLife is not a simulation,<br>\nthere are no days off,<br>\nlife is quite a challenge,<br>\nand demands that each moment builds on the authenticity of the previous.\n\n<br>\n\nOpen the dot, how can you yearn for Authenticity and Companionship,<br>\nand cancel, and fall short, and not enough, and rest some more.\n\nThe gateway between Ordinary and Extraordinary,<br>\nis in accepting that we haven't got a choice to make.\n\nBut shoes... to put on,<br>\nyour Mind and Body must grow in harmony.\n\nYou must not let go of the Harmony,<br>\nof your Magnificent Existence.\n\nEach small success, by subtle analogy,<br>\npushes you forward, to your next step.\n\n<br>\n\nEventually your tightly controlled business failures,<br>\nwill fail, they will, fail to fail.\n\nYour mind too,<br>\nit won't perceive the easy choice as an option.\n\nAll- will proceed,<br>\nin harmony.\n\n<br>\n\nLabored breathing,<br>\nby the Pine Trees at Western States,\n\nAnother great step in Automation of your business,<br>\nand more investors.\n\nAnd you're no longer stopping at the first thing you find in books,<br>\nyou understand all of it.\n\nWhat is made by humans,<br>\nis also All Too Human.\n\n<br>\n\nAnd the Bullies are Gone,<br>\nand Eight Grade still sucks.\n\nHigh school ... influences,<br>\nare trying to figure out where they went wrong - good luck!\n\nCollege, is still a very romantic idea,<br>\nbut it is best left to imagination.\n\nYour dreams are so much more now,<br>\nonly what you create can live up to them.\n\nYou are a Leader,<br>\nfull of might an joy.\n\n<br>\n\nAnd now you know,<br>\nshortcuts only lead people to their beginnings.\n\nAnd the one road, the only road,<br>\nwas the one of Authenticity, and Achievement.\n\nWhere we learned for real, not for grades,<br>\nwhere what we learned added up to create wisdom, and not a stupid GPA.\n\nYou'll be OK, so as long as you Learn onward and become Wise,<br>\nand Live in Authentic Harmony with Yourself.\n\nThis is how you become an Adult,<br>\nthat was the one thing that all others were missing.\n\nIt's what made them pretend and simulate,<br>\nbut, growing up can't be faked.\n\nGrowing up has to be written by the choices you make,<br>\non the surface, that is your lifetime.\n\nThe dreams you always dream, will come true,<br>\nbut not in your childhood, childhood is for learning.\n\nLive in Harmony with yourself,<br>\nand live in harmony with the Universe.\n\nGrowing up is really special,<br>\nit is really important for our health.\n\nIt is a deeply internal process,<br>\nand there are no shortcuts to growing up.\n\nIt is meant to be,<br>\nBeautiful.\n\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=content+management\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=stripe+wordpress\n",

you start with services.</p><p>Look at the gym,<br>\n  monthly subscription, is most stable.</p><p>The lessons, are all around you.</p><br><p>You don&apos;t need college,<br>\n  but taking college classes is very relaxing.</p><p>Make sure you get a 4.0 at each class,<br>\n  be ready to repeat it.</p><p>And enjoy,<br>\n  the lectures.</p><p>College is just a toy,<br>\n  it looks bad on your Portfolio, so hide it.</p><p>It is a very weak teaching experience,<br>\n  and people know that there there is minimal learning involved.</p><p>Jumping from high school to start-ups is more impressive,<br>\n  and shows that you chose knowledge over nonsense.</p><p>It shows that you chose to learn on your own,<br>\n  to take care of your own mind,<br>\n  rather than to pretend to learn for grades.</p><p>Authenticity is very important in life,<br>\n  it is hard to connect with people that role play.</p><br><p>Bonding with people that are just acting,<br>\n  is only functional for as long as they are acting.</p><p>But it is never good,<br>\n  eventually they&apos;ll have a crisis, similar to a mid-life crisis.</p><p>Stay Authentic,<br>\n  keep to to those who are Authentic.</p><p>Be safe.</p><br><p>When it feels like everyone else is having an amazing life,<br>\n  and you are stuck.</p><p>Umm... that not true</p><p>But it is also not healthy to think this way about yourself,<br>\n  you are not beneath the party goers, they don&apos;t have what you have in your mind.</p><br><p>But, that&apos;s far enough,<br>\n  time to get some rest.</p><br><p>This is where it gets interesting,<br>\n  you have primed your mind for Business.</p><p>That is a fine first step,<br>\n  now you need to get ready for the real graduation.</p><p>You need to section hike the equivalent of the Appalachian Trail,<br>\n  and measure your jogging a hundred miles at a time.</p><p>Section jogging, the Western States 100.</p><p>Mind and Body, for the rest of your life.</p><p>You must take good care of both.</p><br><p>At mile fifty, halfway through a run,<br>\n  as you piece together your blurry thoughts of your next business.</p><p>Take some time to understand what it is that College Grads have,<br>\n  those are very brittle relationships, and inflexible careers.</p><p>We all feel the promise, but we can&apos;t fake it,<br>\n  it would be the opposite, and certainly not worthy of you, my Friends.</p><p>You can only find your meaning in Authenticity,<br>\n  shortcuts will only take you back to the beginning.</p><p>To live among the Extraordinary,<br>\n  you must become Extraordinary yourself.</p><br><p>The gateway to Meaning of Life,<br>\n  is in that tiny moment when you think to your self:</p><p>&quot;I am not going to jog tonight, I need rest.&quot;</p><p>Right there in that dot,<br>\n  is the keyhole,<br>\n  to the key that you are,<br>\n  to the gateway that you need to open.</p><p>Life is not a simulation,<br>\n  there are no days off,<br>\n  life is quite a challenge,<br>\n  and demands that each moment builds on the authenticity of the previous.</p><br><p>Open the dot, how can you yearn for Authenticity and Companionship,<br>\n  and cancel, and fall short, and not enough, and rest some more.</p><p>The gateway between Ordinary and Extraordinary,<br>\n  is in accepting that we haven&apos;t got a choice to make.</p><p>But shoes... to put on,<br>\n  your Mind and Body must grow in harmony.</p><p>You must not let go of the Harmony,<br>\n  of your Magnificent Existence.</p><p>Each small success, by subtle analogy,<br>\n  pushes you forward, to your next step.</p><br><p>Eventually your tightly controlled business failures,<br>\n  will fail, they will, fail to fail.</p><p>Your mind too,<br>\n  it won&apos;t perceive the easy choice as an option.</p><p>All- will proceed,<br>\n  in harmony.</p><br><p>Labored breathing,<br>\n  by the Pine Trees at Western States,</p><p>Another great step in Automation of your business,<br>\n  and more investors.</p><p>And you&apos;re no longer stopping at the first thing you find in books,<br>\n  you understand all of it.</p><p>What is made by humans,<br>\n  is also All Too Human.</p><br><p>And the Bullies are Gone,<br>\n  and Eight Grade still sucks.</p><p>High school ... influences,<br>\n  are trying to figure out where they went wrong - good luck!</p><p>College, is still a very romantic idea,<br>\n  but it is best left to imagination.</p><p>Your dreams are so much more now,<br>\n  only what you create can live up to them.</p><p>You are a Leader,<br>\n  full of might an joy.</p><br><p>And now you know,<br>\n  shortcuts only lead people to their beginnings.</p><p>And the one road, the only road,<br>\n  was the one of Authenticity, and Achievement.</p><p>Where we learned for real, not for grades,<br>\n  where what we learned added up to create wisdom, and not a stupid GPA.</p><p>You&apos;ll be OK, so as long as you Learn onward and become Wise,<br>\n  and Live in Authentic Harmony with Yourself.</p><p>This is how you become an Adult,<br>\n  that was the one thing that all others were missing.</p><p>It&apos;s what made them pretend and simulate,<br>\n  but, growing up can&apos;t be faked.</p><p>Growing up has to be written by the choices you make,<br>\n  on the surface, that is your lifetime.</p><p>The dreams you always dream, will come true,<br>\n  but not in your childhood, childhood is for learning.</p><p>Live in Harmony with yourself,<br>\n  and live in harmony with the Universe.</p><p>Growing up is really special,<br>\n  it is really important for our health.</p><p>It is a deeply internal process,<br>\n  and there are no shortcuts to growing up.</p><p>It is meant to be,<br>\n  Beautiful.</p>"

large place, that has been around for a long time,<br>\nit is better not to think of anything cosmic, as that! special.\n\nBut there is one exception.\n\nOnce you come down to Earth, come up to Life, and look then Into The Conscious Self Aware Mind,<br>\nthat is no longer a common occurrence.\n\nThere is nothing normal about it,<br>\nwe are now at the limits of what the Universe could possibly conceive of.\n\nNo machine or hybrid can measure up to the raw power of unleashed consciousness.\n\nNothing partially conscious, can know the depth of Sadness,<br>\nnothing less than conscious could know the Miracle of Happiness.\n\n<br>\n\nWe are used to thinking of ourselves as work horses,<br>\ngreat locomotives that can plow through Pandemics, or a Broken Heart.\n\nBut that is a temporary oversimplification just to keep visions clear,<br>\nborn of a finely tuned mind that can narrow all views down to the important bits.\n\nFocus and selective attention is not a limitation of our mind,<br>\nit is a feature that clears away unimportant things.\n\nWhen we need recall, we can have it in full,<br>\njust imagine your favorite place, and trace along the walls.\n\nEvery window, picture, appliance, and outlet, all the important knickknacks are all there,<br>\nwe don't have memory problems, we don't need better brains.\n\nThe convergence that we need is not about integrating with technology,<br>\nbut combining the good parts of our cultures, so that the world can learn towards Peace.\n\nWithout that shared wisdom, people are easily tricked to believe in conflict,<br>\ninto the belief that there are borders, and across borders they must fight.\n\nBy not helping each other to understand how special and unique we each are,<br>\nthere grows a vocal

a cog, in a bigger machine,<br>\nbut there is no machine, just that blind mind.\n\n<br>\n\nIt is OK to focus on just a few things so that we may grow, and grow in wisdom too,<br>\nbut it is not OK to live in some narrow channel for simplicity sake.\n\nIt actually isn't OK to do things to simplify,<br>\ncomplexity only moves in one direction.\n\nThere is nothing healthy that can be done to un-mix a cup of tea,<br>\nthere is nothing useful to be found in moving backwards in time.\n\nComplexity grows, and to make sense of growing complexity,<br>\nwe cannot hope to simplify it, but rather adapt our minds to grasp it more efficiently.\n\nThe World must Go Forward, Move Forward,<br>\nwhat needs to change is out Tolerance for Bad Ideas.\n\nBut growing up to the challenges of ever increasing

down,<br>\nis you never becoming aware of your Great Power.\n\nI know Superman comes to mind when you think of Superpowers and Superheroes,<br>\nBut do think Superman is actually super because he can lift or fly?\n\nIf Superman was as super as he needs to be, he would become Human,<br>\nand build Schools to prevent War a Hundred Years before it happened.\n\nHe'd then age, so that the Little Ones,<br>\nwould listen to him without dismissing him as a Genius that lives on cloud nine.\n\nHe'd then let the little ones build with a thousand minds,<br>\nwhat his one mind, couldn't grasp.\n\nThe greatest of superheroes, would encourage us to build things,<br>\nthat help the world to converge,<br>\non Cultures of Wisdom that leave bad ideas behind.\n\nI ask you, My Dear Readers,<br>\nto begin

You don't need a charging bear to learn.<br>\nYou can use clay, or canvas, or music.\n\nThere is no finer way to push loneliness away,<br>\nthan to sculpt the meaning of touch.\n\nAnd there is no better way to learn courage,<br>\nthan to paint a chain of works that inspire to motion.\n\nAnd music need not make someone cry to be powerful,<br>\nmake the beat move your own feet, as you run your first ultra.\n\n<br>\n\nConsider how simple a Desktop in your Operating System is,<br>\nand yet, how perfectly impossible it is, to drag the icon out of the computer.\n\nIt is right there, you can wiggle it,<br>\nand yet it is trapped in a prison, of invisible walls.\n\n<br>\n\nAnd consider, how different you are, from all the people you have met,<br>\nhow you don't even smile at the things that make them laugh.\n\nHow not a single person out of the Eight Billion,<br>\ncould possibly take your place.\n\nHow often it feels that all the people around you are sleepy,<br>\nhow some seem different, because they could not do, what they do, if they were not wide awake.\n\nTo integrate with wisdom, you cannot read the same books others read,<br>\nyour mind represents a perfectly unique constellation of stars.\n\nTo integrate with wisdom,<br>\nnot only do you have to indirectly wiggle around by subtle analogy to other things.\n\nBut you have to fish out just the perfect morsels that fit you,<br>\nin just the perfect sequence, out of a unique collection of mutually reinforcing works of Philosophy.\n\n<br>\n\nYou start in the beginning, with Survey Courses, as these outline the most brilliant ideas first,<br>\nthere you can recognize thoughts that fit you, that you already had in your constellation.\n\nOrganized Education, poisons your confidence in education, because everything they teach,<br>\nis in an inhuman, synthetic, and impersonal sequence.\n\nMoreover, the easily forgotten and fragile clusters of incomplete information,<br>\naim to build on one another, they guarantee you won't understand, and will only overwhelm you in the end.\n\nThe celebrating of a Diploma, is a sacred ritual, that has been erased, and replaced,<br>\nwith a more sugarcoated \"I am finally out\".\n\nThis is a perfect recipe for bondage, blindness, weakness,<br>\nand worse.\n\nWe must not allow a fake sugar pop triumph,<br>\nto replace the Real Triumph or Knowledge and Wisdom.\n\nIt can only get worse,<br>\na day will come when the Libraries will close.\n\nSchool and Library, above all, were meant to be a symbol,<br>\nan extension to your own self education.\n\nYour Education,<br>\nthe pathway to Peace, Safety, Security, Self Control, Harmony, Enlightenment.\n\n<br>\n\nWhat has occurred to cause the fog, is a drop of packets of information,<br>\nwe are too complex, the world is too complex, parenting is too complex, teaching is too complex.\n\nIt can get worse, if we continue celebrating false graduations, and fake education,<br>\nif we keep forgetting that our family, has Eight Billion members and each must grow up for real.\n\nThe solution is to remind ourselves, that growing up is not about feeling like an adult,<br>\nbut rather Transcending our Limits, and Pushing Through gaps, towards Wisdom.\n\nWe face problems that can only be solved by Intellectual or Cultural Unity.\n\nThe Problem of War, is solved by Education, Wisdom, and Unity.\n\nThe Problem of Education, is solved by Helping Everyone to a Fair Start.\n\nThe Problem of Crime, can be Solved by Mental Heath Care, and Prevention.\n\nThe Problem of Poverty and Slavery, is Solved by Universal Income.\n\nAll these problems are our problems, and the solutions are ours as well.\n\nBut they rest across a Gap, a gap that Humanity must cross.\n\nAnd the next step,<br>\nis your step.\n\n<br>\n\nNothing worth your precious time, can be faked, or made up, or make believe,<br>\nit all has to be Authentic, Powerful, Guttural, Raw.\n\nIt will hurt in the Muscle and Bone,<br>\nbut eventually you'll forget to pay attention to what is unimportant.\n\nYou are not to be taught that you are dime a dozen,<br>\nand that they just can't find a job for you, because you don't fit or conform.\n\nPeople believe this nonsense,<br>\nbecause they don't have anything to draw from by subtle analogy.\n\nThat is why we must challenge ourselves to Great Deeds,<br>\nto acquire the experiences necessary to tell Wisdom from Waste.\n\nWhen you hear someone putting you down, pushing you around, belittling you,<br>\nyou are to leave, because that someone has fractured and broke, and are now ill.\n\nIt is the oldest and sickest trick,<br>\nto convince someone they don't matter.\n\nThey do it for personal gain, money or laziness,<br>\nto people who do not have a library of Grand Experiences from which they can draw wisdom, by Subtle Analogy.\n\n<br>\n\nGet Up.\n\nFind your temple of solitude, The Two Beautiful Trees, The Bridge Over Hudson River,<br>\nThe Highway Overpass, The Starry Beach where the Stars Come Out at Night and mingle with Starfish.\n\nAnd know, that you are a Child of The Universe, first,<br>\nThat! is your background.\n\nNow face Humanity anew,<br>\nout from the edge of the Universe.\n\nLook,<br>\nlook at all those things that made you small.\n\nLook how unimportant the inauthentic is,<br>\nhow fragile those words that upset you really were.\n\n<br>\n\nAnd pay attention, to the real problem,<br>\nhow easily you were tricked and mislead.\n\nThat cannot go on,<br>\nyou are not a push around.\n\nI wish you knew how Powerful you really are,<br>\nhow easily you learn at your own pace in the sequence that fits you best.\n\nHow All Too Human, all too familiar, all too easy,<br>\nthe acquisition of wisdom really is.\n\n<br>\n\nNot all Adults are defined by Outspoken Wisdom, some find Greatness in Love Returned,<br>\nand what a Great Power, can those Two even make a mistake?\n\nI don't think there is anything other than Love, that can substitute for Wisdom,<br>\nit is both The Love of Two, and The Love of a Big Mother in a large family,<br>\na Mother that always brings hugs, warm meals and Wisdom.\n\nBut, True Love is rare, so while you search, you must also grow in Wisdom,<br>\nfrom now on, you will have to learn to tell the children apart from the adults.\n\nAnd not by looking at how old they are, or how well they dress, or how sharply they move in their environment,<br>\nyou will now look at their Authenticity, and Content of Character.\n\nNo one who lacks in Authenticity, or has little Content of Character,<br>\nhas anything to contribute to you life, certainly nothing negative.\n\nHope for them to recover, and become wise, and healthy,<br>\nlet them know that they are a Child of The Universe, and they count - but go.\n\nDon't let anybody hurt you,<br>\ndon't let anybody hurt your heart, or mind.\n\n<br>\n\nGo!<br>\nbecause you need your heart and mind, to grow.\n\nGo!,<br>\nwith the certainty of knowing that you are more.\n\nGo!,<br>\nso as long as you Rise you won't be lonely for long.\n\nGo!<br>\nbecause there has never been a way other than forward and up.\n\nGo!<br>\nand don't be scared, all great journeys start with little things.\n\n<br>\n\nThe Others, who went through the same,<br>\nare with you in Spirit.\n\nSo many invisible battles have been fought,<br>\nand as much triumph gone unnoticed.\n\nThe Warriors are everywhere, and they stand by your side,<br>\nyou are in company of Great Heroes.\n\nClimb by subtle analogy to the triumphs already had,<br>\nrise to the highest of mountains.\n\nYou are Meant to Become a Great Being,<br>\nand You are meant to remind others to follow a similar path.\n\nRise, and you will be well on your way,<br>\nHumanity only grows, when people like you tear down those thin invisible walls.\n\n<br>\n\nWherever you are right now, begin transcending your limits,<br>\nno matter how small, each will help you learn more.\n\nWith each new success more pathways will become visible to you,<br>\nyou are not trapped, you are just at the beginning of your journey.\n\nIt is hard to see it all because you are still learning,<br>\nbut it is easy to read or listen to books, and inherit great visions from others.\n\nIt will never get easier,<br>\nbut you will grow greater, to a point where ease will become irrelevant to your existence.\n\nYou must use your Heart and Mind to learn all the lessons ahead,<br>\nno one can teach you, you must find your own books.\n\nBy Subtle Analogy,<br>\nRise to Your Greatness.\n",

throughout your entire existence.\n\nIt is the power of creating a life that you will love,<br>\na life that will help you see with great clarity.\n\nA Life of Wisdom.\n\n<br>\n\nBut you must be careful,\nas the world may not yet be ready to help you.\n\nNot everyone will know about growing up,<br>\nand people will say: \"How was I supposed to know?\"\n\nAnd they are not going to be the bad guys,<br>\nand you will be inclined to listen to their advice.\n\nAnd the path will be paved with good intentions,<br>\nit maybe the correct path, but it won't be the right one.\n\n<br>\n\nPlease, focus on building your own self,<br>\nyour strength, your wisdom, your power.\n\nFocus on building the best you,<br>\nthe you that you are meant to be, that the world needs.\n\n<br>\n\nBecause if you listen to everybody else,<br>\nyou will not grow up, and they will blame you for not being able to help them.\n\nYou are not going to be able to explain to them,<br>\nthat you are weak because of them,<br>\nbecause you tried to help them too early.\n\nAnd if you could, all they could say will be:<br>\n\"How was I supposed to know?\"\n\n<br>\n\nPlease, you have no choice,<br>\nbut to learn to control your own future.\n\nYou can try to use your imagination,<br>\nto get in touch with your Elder Self;\n\nAnd ask \"What are your regrets?\",<br>\n\"Where did it go wrong?\"\n\n<br>\n\nPlease, carefully evaluate your choices,<br>\nwisely build your Mind and Body.\n\nPay attention to all the choices you are making,<br>\nas they dictate the Beautiful Life Ahead of You.\n\n<br>\n\nThe teachers are not ready, we are not in the Era of Wisdom yet,<br>\npeople are struggling to understand life.\n\nMany make choices that all too early box them in,<br>\nand not all their advice will apply to you.\n\nNot all the things that you think box people in,<br>\nactually constrain them, there are many contexts to all the paths.\n\nAll lives are beautiful, and there are enough forks in the road,<br>\nfor people to navigate back to where they want to be.\n\nBut, when a mistake occurs, it will weigh you down for a time,<br>\nif you are careful, you can avoid the worst of it.\n\nAnd whatever does happen, regardless of how hard you tried to avoid it,<br>\nwill not crush you, because you will know you did your best.\n\n<br>\n\nPlease, be careful in life, be beautiful, and strong,<br>\nlearn, and think, and evaluate, and judge, and grow in wisdom.\n\nFollowing everyone's advice, will create a lot of noise,<br>\nlistening to everything from everywhere will never align with you.\n\nYou must lean to pace yourself,<br>\nand to carefully and wisely follow what interests you.\n\nYour mind is constantly asking questions,<br>\nyour future depends on having a good intuition, rooted in reality, and in wisdom.\n\nThere is nothing you can be force-taught school,<br>\nyou will not retain things that are out of sequence.\n\nReaching out for Knowledge and Wisdom in your own sequence, and at your own pace,<br>\nis the only way to learn, and build steps, and build on top of those steps.\n\nNo one can decide what lesson you are ready for next,<br>\nthat is

intentions,<br>\n  it maybe the correct path, but it won&apos;t be the right one.</p><br><p>Please, focus on building your own self,<br>\n  your strength, your wisdom, your power.</p><p>Focus on building the best you,<br>\n  the you that you are meant to be, that the world needs.</p><br><p>Because if you listen to everybody else,<br>\n  you will not grow up, and they will blame you for not

people to navigate back to where they want to be.</p><p>But, when a mistake occurs, it will weigh you down for a time,<br>\n  if you are careful, you can avoid the worst of it.</p><p>And whatever does

and think, and evaluate, and judge, and grow in wisdom.</p><p>Following everyone&apos;s advice, will create a lot of noise,<br>\n  listening to everything from everywhere will never align with

to remind us that the World is Not Static,<br>\nthat it grows, moves, changes, and cares not to stop for things writ on paper.\n\nAdvancements in Psychology... the trailer to the movie about Philip Zimbardo work - alone,<br>\nshould invalidate laws and behaviors previously thought acceptable.\n\nHumanity must grow, our cultures must drive us all forward,<br>\nwe must never assume that the world we are born into is a masterpiece.\n\nAnd we must never let ourselves think,<br>\nthat others are in charge -

civilization with a past and a future.\n\nAnd we might have become confused about the Scope of Our Existence,<br>\nwe stand divided by borders and committed to repeating history's mistakes.\n\nIt is unwise to pretend to be able to handle a great responsibility,<br>\nonly desperation, fractures, and exploitation by other desperate pretenders can follow.\n\nThose who are granted authority are often not wise enough to handle it,<br>\nand in their mediocrity they commit what in larger scope translates to real Crimes Against Humanity.\n\nThere cannot be wisdom without understanding and inheriting from past generations,<br>\nthe transfer of knowledge occurs by means of Understanding Books.\n\nAnd there cannot be understanding without Authenticity,<br>\nin haste of chasing a career there can only be memorization and misunderstanding.\n\nWe must keep in mind; that what the future generations do not perceive as clear progress,<br>\nwill be seen as the continuation of dark ages with authorities on the wrong side of history.\n\nThe World United, is not a fairy-tale, nor should it be a mere dream for us,<br>\nbut a Gift of Peace for The Future Generations, so that they may grow in Dignity, Health, and Wisdom.\n\nWe are neither disconnected from the future generations, nor the past generations,<br>\nwe are a stepping stone in the development of The Human Kind.\n\nAnd we should recognize this Great Honor and Reward,<br>\nand understand that the larger context is found in helping to build a better world for future generations.\n\nAll our decisions, across all levels and authorities,<br>\nPolice, Attorneys and Judges, Parents, Teachers and Principals, Mayors, Governors, Prime Misters and Presidents, and everybody else...\n\nMust be mindful of future generations, of a growing world, of making lasting and meaningful contributions to the entire human kind,<br>\na World that will eventually become united and free of borders.\n\n\n\nA world with future generations that will look back at us,<br>\nright now, right here, with questions that we must present answers to.\n\nWe are getting stuck in circles,<br>\nbecause people are forgetting history's lessons.\n\nBecause we are not thinking on a large enough scale,<br>\nwe end up building more prisons rather than ending poverty with meaningful prevention programs.\n\nEndless cycles of heartless poverty that freeze the best of us,<br>\npoverty that wouldn't even be a feature of modern society had we in our wisdom recognized it for what it is.\n\nPoverty denies people food and well being,<br>\ncauses stress and great harm to mind and body.\n\nLove above Law, before we allow the practice of law,<br>\nwe must end the cycles of poverty.\n\nMoney must not be used to limit people,<br>\nit is meant to help.\n\nAnd how can a culture be to fail to see, how a young person allowed to build a business without the threat of homelessness and starvation,<br>\nwill contribute back to the city and everyone's well being.\n\nWhat is so hard about seeing that rather than sending non-violent criminals to prison,<br>\nwe can prevent their biggest mistakes by putting an end to their worries of sleeping hungry on the street.\n\n<br>\n\nAny time, we fail to keep to reality,<br>\nbe it sending a 15 year old lady to prison, or denying science, or tolerating arrests by obscured or unidentified agencies, or abuses of power or discretion.\n\nWe create fractures and distrust,<br>\nblindly defacing and destroying work of many much wiser great beings, who gave their best trusting that we can carry on, in wisdom.\n\nWe must not move against the grain of reality,<br>\nany and all divergence will only create a cascade of fractures that will demand constant attention<br>\nand result in nothing more than systems that merely stand to support themselves and as an affront to justice and future generations.\n\nWhere there was once a solution as clear as helping children to inherit the wisdom of their elders,<br>\nwe now see the emergence of a failed and impotent educational system with a mass incarceration backed.\n\nWisdom and inheritance of knowledge cannot be replaced by a \"fake it until you make it\" trickery,<br>\nthe work of great beings must not be stained by people who fail to see their vision.\n\n<br>\n\nOnce again, the world grows a generation at a time,<br>\nthe education of the teenagers from 20 years ago is currently influencing the state of the world.\n\nLikewise, how we treat out children today,<br>\nwill have a monumental impact on the world 20 years from now.\n\n<br>\n\nLet us honor our children and all the future generations by encouraging them to books,<br>\nby reminding them of the Great Power of Thinking Beings, of Philosophers and Lovers of Wisdom.\n\nBy reminding them that their Pursuit of Excellence,<br>\ncan only make the world a better place for us all, and even those that are yet to come.\n\nLet us remind them that Books (and now Audio Books) serve as a wonderful source of our wisdom,<br>\nespecially when read in a sequence that fits them best, and understood at thier own pace.\n\n<br>\n\nLet us remind each other that we must reject short thinking and shortest paths,<br>\nthat do not help the world grow and keep us divided.\n\nLet us break out of that selfish endless loop of repeating mistakes of past generations,<br>\nby working towards a better world a more united world where we recognize each other as One Family.\n\n<br>\n\nAnd let us remember that the great and wise beings of past generations,<br>\ndemand that we honor hard won triumphs and do not repeat history's mistakes.\n\nThe very nature of that demand requires that once we take to wisdom,<br>\nwe must stop following orders, and begin thinking, evaluating, and judging for ourselves.\n\nTo honor triumphs and guard against heartbreaking mistakes,<br>\nis the duty we hold to those who came before us,<br>\nand all the future generations that are yet to follow.\n\n<br>\n\nAs children we are asked to listen and follow,<br>\nas we grow we must learn to Lead and become Unbreakable.\n\nIt is not just the challenges of life that will test us,<br>\nwe must also think and evaluate and reject that which is wrong.\n\n<br>\n\nWe are constantly made to listen and expected to follow,<br>\nlook behind any protest, or scandal, or angry headline.\n\nWe must judge all the contradictory information for ourselves,<br>\nand make an informed decision as to whether or not majority is correct.\n\n<br>\n\nLife will always challenge us,<br>\nand My Goodness - times are always changing.\n\nHumanity is constantly bettering her self,<br>\nwhat used to be acceptable - may now, be an affront to justice.\n\nAnd while there isn't enough time to comprehend all the books,<br>\nthere is plenty of time to be come a Loving and Wise Compassionate Human Being,\n\nLet us remember that we are a chain-link between the Hard Work of Past Generations,<br>\nand the United, Free from Poverty, and Peaceful Word of **Future** Generations.\n\nWe are One Growing Family, and that is the correct context for local, state, and federal levels, for all legal and administrative decision making,<br>\nto diverge from this reality is to get stuck in an endless loop of repeating history's mistakes, the very thing that the past generations are asking us not to do.\n",

not good enough.\n\nHow many teachers tried to tell their students that they are bad at learning,<br>\nand how many children became convinced of that, that they are not smart?\n\nWhere truth is, that we are all equally capable,<br>\nall capable of genius so as long as it is real kind and not the \"I am better than you kind\" like photographic memory<br>\n(which is fake, no one ever had it;

And you must keep walking forward. Your own step, after your own step.<br>\nIn your own direction, towards the things that move you, only then can You be Trully Moved.\n\nIt must the correct combination of books, poems, steps, events, summers, and epochs.<br>\nDo not try to hurry, do not change roads, only move up, only think, and envision, and grow.\n\nThat which leads to Your Greatness, to Your Freedom, to Your Nature, requires, Truth.<br>\nWalk your own path at your own pace. Only the correct key, can set your mind free.\n\nThe others who seem to have it all right.<br>\nOften get lost on alien paths, and merely put on a happy face.\n\nWhile it seems like you are trapped today, you are not, it is just an illusion.<br>\nLook towards the car keys.\n\nThat is all it will take. Grab the keys and go.<br>\nIt will be very difficult at first.\n\nThe toxic build up that is keeping you from getting up, right now,<br>\ntakes three days to crumble. It is a heavy cage.\n\nBut there is a way.<br>\nA simple way.\n\nGrab the keys, and go... i275 south, merge onto 75 south,<br>\nand take it all the way down... Florida Keys, US Highway One.\n\nIf you live in Florida, then you are headed for Michigan's Upper Peninsula.<br>\nIf you live West, your destination is all the way East.\n\nIt is not the destination, it is the Journey, my Friend.<br>\nTake your time, watch the cage crumble and fade as you go.\n\nOnly the important things, will stay.<br>\nAnd you'll get to see yourself again.\n\nAnd you'll get to be free again,<br>\nyou will resume where you left of.\n\nA life of bondage,<br>\nis not worthy of you.\n\nLife is not meant to be a cage, or cruel, or frighten you.<br>\nYou knew this as a child, and you let that slip away, not even noticing when it went.\n\nIt is your Right to resist being pushed into places that you don't want to be in.<br>\nIt is your Right to reject conditions that you never agreed to, that you were pushed into.\n\nHow else can the Universe be worthy of us, how else can our lives be beautiful.<br>\nHeaven and Paradise are real, but they are now, right now. Now.\n\nHow can people love you, when your own love for yourself is slipping away.<br>\nYou have to.

are still very young,<br>\nbarely know of the world.\n\nAnd already the question of harmony comes,<br>\nand in harmony we learn, and thrive.\n\nAway from it, we'll be interrupted,<br>\nand feel lost in the void.\n\nIt is a simple choice,<br>\nbut out minds are not ready to make it.\n\nOften we forget.\n\nWe forget about our little gardens,<br>\nand all the little walks.\n\nWe forget how amazing it felt,<br>\nto stand on the wing of a plane.\n\nWe forget the taste of popcorn at the Zoo,<br>\nor even how enormous Zoo felt.\n\nWe forget pebbles at the river,<br>\nand mischievous squires at the park.\n\n<br>\n\nThat little dog with a bark,<br>\nthat scaredy kitten always hiding in the dark.\n\nOur collection of unused keys,<br>\nand the box of bottle caps we collected with ease.\n\nWe forgot our Lego and the old bike,<br>\nwith that seat that we used to really like.\n\nWe don't remember the Palaces and Castles,<br>\nthat we used to love, and those swords, that fit us like a glove.\n\n<br>\n\nEverybody else came around,<br>\nacting like they know the ground.\n\nBut, this was our gift from the Universe,<br>\nan affinity for flowering gardens, and little passage ways, and all those flying planes.\n\nIt was a key to unlock our mind,<br>\nto understand the zoo, and our size in the universe, connect with pebbles at the beach.\n\nIt is a pathway that fits us best,<br>\nto love little creatures, and collect some shineys, and build with blocks, and ride far and wide.\n\nIt was to remind us,<br>\nto find our place among Great Beings, and study and pursue excellence, in all we do.\n\n<br>\n\nThen they sent us to First Grade,<br>\nand the weird kid peed into the Duplo, they didn't even have Lego.\n\nThen the teacher graded you down for counting pebles in your pocket,<br>\nand did it so many times, you lost track.\n\n<br>\n\nThere was a whisper about the pebbles,<br>\nit was Mr. Sagan - \"You are made of Star Stuff.\"\n\nAnd then the kids whispered...<br>\nto push you in the mud.\n\n<br>\n\nPush their laughter aside,<br>\nyou'll need to Learn, and learn really hard.\n\nCause right now, you're in the mud,<br>\nand you need to hang on.\n\nIt will get worse,<br>\nbut all you have to do is rise.\n\nEach time,<br>\nyou'll rise higher.\n\n(When in trouble, call the Police it is OK for kids to call the Police, they'll love helping you, don't be scared.)\n\n<br>\n\nThird Grade,<br>\nFifth Grade.\n\nLow grade,<br>\nUhh, but there can't be higher.\n\nBecause by this time, you're getting bad grades,<br>\nbecause the teacher thinks you're copying from somewhere.\n\nThe bullies know,<br>\nyou did it on your own.\n\nSaw you pacing for days,<br>\nwith your first program.\n\nKeep going forward,<br>\ndon't let go - you're doing great, stay away from the hate.\n\n<br>\n\nBy the time you're out of Eight Grade,<br>\nby rejecting crazy, and nonsense, and stupid, and lazy, you graduate above all others.\n\nBecause you didn't follow,<br>\nbecause you chose to study on your own, at your own pace.\n\nBecause worthless grades meant nothing,<br>\nyou felt no stress.\n\nBecause, you didn't follow<br>\nnothing could hurt you.\n\nAnd your world is yours,<br>\ntruly-truly yours.\n\n<br>\n\nWe unravel, when we forget who we are,<br>\nthe moment we hide, or pretend, or follow.\n\nAnd, gosh darn it,<br>\nit happens when we are still kids.\n\nWe are completely unprepared,<br>\nand none will help.\n\n<br>\n\nSo you! have to keep it together,<br>\nyou can't let anyone hurt your mind.\n\nIn High School, the pretenders make a sudden appearance,<br>\nnever held a book in their hand.\n\nThe back of Hamlet,<br>\nall the quotes have more IQ.\n\nLet the little Caesars,<br>\nkeep the wind from the hall away.\n\nYou need to pace your reading at the library,<br>\nteach yourself focus.\n\nDon't EVER! finish the books,<br>\njust get to the part that is valuable to you, and skip the rest.\n\n<br>\n\nStart working on your start-up early,<br>\nit is a study in failure.\n\nYou need to create a series of CONTROLLED FAILURES,<br>\nthis is very important.\n\nLearn [content management][1],<br>\nand figure out [billing][2]\n\nThat's your surface platform,<br>\nand think about nature of business.\n\nNever try to build things directly,<br>\nfacilitate the building of direct things for others.\n\nHelp them setup,<br>\nso that you are not burdened, and keep going.\n\nLook at the structure of start-up accelerators, or even banks,<br>\nthey take a percent, and never create what will weigh them down.\n\nEventually, you can build your own Tesla,<br>\nbut at first, you start with services.\n\nLook at the gym,<br>\nmonthly subscription, is most stable.\n\nThe lessons, are all around you.\n\n<br>\n\nYou don't need college,<br>\nbut taking college classes is very relaxing.\n\nMake sure you get a 4.0 at each class,<br>\nbe ready to repeat it.\n\nAnd enjoy,<br>\nthe lectures.\n\nCollege is just a toy,<br>\nit looks bad on your Portfolio, so hide it.\n\nIt is a very weak teaching experience,<br>\nand people know that there there is minimal learning involved.\n\nJumping from high school to start-ups is more impressive,<br>\nand shows that you chose knowledge over nonsense.\n\nIt shows that you chose to learn on your own,<br>\nto take care of your own mind,<br>\nrather than to pretend to learn for grades.\n\nAuthenticity is very important in life,<br>\nit is hard to connect with people that role play.\n\n<br>\n\nBonding with people that are just acting,<br>\nis only functional for as long as they are acting.\n\nBut it is never good,<br>\neventually they'll have a crisis, similar to a mid-life crisis.\n\nStay Authentic,<br>\nkeep to to those who are Authentic.\n\nBe safe.\n\n<br>\n\nWhen it feels like everyone else is having an amazing life,<br>\nand you are stuck.\n\nUmm... that not true\n\nBut it is also not healthy to think this way about yourself,<br>\nyou are not beneath the party goers, they don't have what you have in your mind.\n\n<br>\n\nBut, that's far enough,<br>\ntime to get some rest.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is where it gets interesting,<br>\nyou have primed your mind for Business.\n\nThat is a fine first step,<br>\nnow you need to get ready for the real graduation.\n\nYou need to section hike the equivalent of the Appalachian Trail,<br>\nand measure your jogging a hundred miles at a time.\n\nSection jogging, the Western States 100.\n\nMind and Body, for the rest of your life.\n\nYou must take good care of both.\n\n<br>\n\nAt mile fifty, halfway through a run,<br>\nas you piece together your blurry thoughts of your next business.\n\nTake some time to understand what it is that College Grads have,<br>\nthose are very brittle relationships, and inflexible careers.\n\nWe all feel the promise, but we can't fake it,<br>\nit would be the opposite, and certainly not worthy of you, my Friends.\n\nYou can only find your meaning in Authenticity,<br>\nshortcuts will only take you back to the beginning.\n\nTo live among the Extraordinary,<br>\nyou must become Extraordinary yourself.\n\n<br>\n\nThe gateway to Meaning of Life,<br>\nis in that tiny moment when you think to your self:\n\n\"I am not going to jog tonight, I need rest.\"\n\nRight there in that dot,<br>\nis the keyhole,<br>\nto the key that you are,<br>\nto the gateway that you need to open.\n\nLife is not a simulation,<br>\nthere are no days off,<br>\nlife is quite a challenge,<br>\nand demands that each moment builds on the authenticity of the previous.\n\n<br>\n\nOpen the dot, how can you yearn for Authenticity and Companionship,<br>\nand cancel, and fall short, and not enough, and rest some more.\n\nThe gateway between Ordinary and Extraordinary,<br>\nis in accepting that we haven't got a choice to make.\n\nBut shoes... to put on,<br>\nyour Mind and Body must grow in harmony.\n\nYou must not let go of the Harmony,<br>\nof your Magnificent Existence.\n\nEach small success, by subtle analogy,<br>\npushes you forward, to your next step.\n\n<br>\n\nEventually your tightly controlled business failures,<br>\nwill fail, they will, fail to fail.\n\nYour mind too,<br>\nit won't perceive the easy choice as an option.\n\nAll- will proceed,<br>\nin harmony.\n\n<br>\n\nLabored breathing,<br>\nby the Pine Trees at Western States,\n\nAnother great step in Automation of your business,<br>\nand more investors.\n\nAnd you're no longer stopping at the first thing you find in books,<br>\nyou understand all of it.\n\nWhat is made by humans,<br>\nis also All Too Human.\n\n<br>\n\nAnd the Bullies are Gone,<br>\nand Eight Grade still sucks.\n\nHigh school ... influences,<br>\nare trying to figure out where they went wrong - good luck!\n\nCollege, is still a very romantic idea,<br>\nbut it is best left to imagination.\n\nYour dreams are so much more now,<br>\nonly what you create can live up to them.\n\nYou are a Leader,<br>\nfull of might an joy.\n\n<br>\n\nAnd now you know,<br>\nshortcuts only lead people to their beginnings.\n\nAnd the one road, the only road,<br>\nwas the one of Authenticity, and Achievement.\n\nWhere we learned for real, not for grades,<br>\nwhere what we learned added up to create wisdom, and not a stupid GPA.\n\nYou'll be OK, so as long as you Learn onward and become Wise,<br>\nand Live in Authentic Harmony with Yourself.\n\nThis is how you become an Adult,<br>\nthat was the one thing that all others were missing.\n\nIt's what made them pretend and simulate,<br>\nbut, growing up can't be faked.\n\nGrowing up has to be written by the choices you make,<br>\non the surface, that is your lifetime.\n\nThe dreams you always dream, will come true,<br>\nbut not in your childhood, childhood is for learning.\n\nLive in Harmony with yourself,<br>\nand live in harmony with the Universe.\n\nGrowing up is really special,<br>\nit is really important for our health.\n\nIt is a deeply internal process,<br>\nand there are no shortcuts to growing up.\n\nIt is meant to be,<br>\nBeautiful.\n\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=content+management\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=stripe+wordpress\n",

learn, and thrive.</p><p>Away from it, we&apos;ll be interrupted,<br>\n  and feel lost in the void.</p><p>It is a simple choice,<br>\n  but out minds are not ready to make it.</p><p>Often we

the Zoo,<br>\n  or even how enormous Zoo felt.</p><p>We forget pebbles at the river,<br>\n  and mischievous squires at the park.</p><br><p>That little dog with a bark,<br>\n  that scaredy kitten always hiding in the dark.</p><p>Our collection of unused keys,<br>\n  and the box of bottle caps we collected with ease.</p><p>We forgot our Lego and the old bike,<br>\n  with that seat that we used to really like.</p><p>We don&apos;t remember the Palaces and Castles,<br>\n  that we used to love, and those swords, that fit us like a glove.</p><br><p>Everybody else came around,<br>\n  acting like they know the ground.</p><p>But, this was our gift from the Universe,<br>\n  an affinity for flowering gardens, and little passage ways, and all those flying planes.</p><p>It was a key to unlock our mind,<br>\n  to understand the zoo, and our size in the universe, connect with pebbles at the beach.</p><p>It is a pathway that fits us best,<br>\n  to love little creatures, and collect some shineys, and build with blocks, and ride far and wide.</p><p>It was to remind us,<br>\n  to find our place among Great Beings, and study and pursue excellence, in all we do.</p><br><p>Then they sent us to

You don't need a charging bear to learn.<br>\nYou can use clay, or canvas, or music.\n\nThere is no finer way to push loneliness away,<br>\nthan to sculpt the meaning of touch.\n\nAnd there is no better way to learn courage,<br>\nthan to paint a chain of works that inspire to motion.\n\nAnd music need not make someone cry to be powerful,<br>\nmake the beat move your own feet, as you run your first ultra.\n\n<br>\n\nConsider how simple a Desktop in your Operating System is,<br>\nand yet, how perfectly impossible it is, to drag the icon out of the computer.\n\nIt is right there, you can wiggle it,<br>\nand yet it is trapped in a prison, of invisible walls.\n\n<br>\n\nAnd consider, how different you are, from all the people you have met,<br>\nhow you don't even smile at the things that make them laugh.\n\nHow not a single person out of the Eight Billion,<br>\ncould possibly take your place.\n\nHow often it feels that all the people around you are sleepy,<br>\nhow some seem different, because they could not do, what they do, if they were not wide awake.\n\nTo integrate with wisdom, you cannot read the same books others read,<br>\nyour mind represents a perfectly unique constellation of stars.\n\nTo integrate with wisdom,<br>\nnot only do you have to indirectly wiggle around by subtle analogy to other things.\n\nBut you have to fish out just the perfect morsels that fit you,<br>\nin just the perfect sequence, out of a unique collection of mutually reinforcing works of Philosophy.\n\n<br>\n\nYou start in the beginning, with Survey Courses, as these outline the most brilliant ideas first,<br>\nthere you can recognize thoughts that fit you, that you already had in your constellation.\n\nOrganized Education, poisons your confidence in education, because everything they teach,<br>\nis in an inhuman, synthetic, and impersonal sequence.\n\nMoreover, the easily forgotten and fragile clusters of incomplete information,<br>\naim to build on one another, they guarantee you won't understand, and will only overwhelm you in the end.\n\nThe celebrating of a Diploma, is a sacred ritual, that has been erased, and replaced,<br>\nwith a more sugarcoated \"I am finally out\".\n\nThis is a perfect recipe for bondage, blindness, weakness,<br>\nand worse.\n\nWe must not allow a fake sugar pop triumph,<br>\nto replace the Real Triumph or Knowledge and Wisdom.\n\nIt can only get worse,<br>\na day will come when the Libraries will close.\n\nSchool and Library, above all, were meant to be a symbol,<br>\nan extension to your own self education.\n\nYour Education,<br>\nthe pathway to Peace, Safety, Security, Self Control, Harmony, Enlightenment.\n\n<br>\n\nWhat has occurred to cause the fog, is a drop of packets of information,<br>\nwe are too complex, the world is too complex, parenting is too complex, teaching is too complex.\n\nIt can get worse, if we continue celebrating false graduations, and fake education,<br>\nif we keep forgetting that our family, has Eight Billion members and each must grow up for real.\n\nThe solution is to remind ourselves, that growing up is not about feeling like an adult,<br>\nbut rather Transcending our Limits, and Pushing Through gaps, towards Wisdom.\n\nWe face problems that can only be solved by Intellectual or Cultural Unity.\n\nThe Problem of War, is solved by Education, Wisdom, and Unity.\n\nThe Problem of Education, is solved by Helping Everyone to a Fair Start.\n\nThe Problem of Crime, can be Solved by Mental Heath Care, and Prevention.\n\nThe Problem of Poverty and Slavery, is Solved by Universal Income.\n\nAll these problems are our problems, and the solutions are ours as well.\n\nBut they rest across a Gap, a gap that Humanity must cross.\n\nAnd the next step,<br>\nis your step.\n\n<br>\n\nNothing worth your precious time, can be faked, or made up, or make believe,<br>\nit all has to be Authentic, Powerful, Guttural, Raw.\n\nIt will hurt in the Muscle and Bone,<br>\nbut eventually you'll forget to pay attention to what is unimportant.\n\nYou are not to be taught that you are dime a dozen,<br>\nand that they just can't find a job for you, because you don't fit or conform.\n\nPeople believe this nonsense,<br>\nbecause they don't have anything to draw from by subtle analogy.\n\nThat is why we must challenge ourselves to Great Deeds,<br>\nto acquire the experiences necessary to tell Wisdom from Waste.\n\nWhen you hear someone putting you down, pushing you around, belittling you,<br>\nyou are to leave, because that someone has fractured and broke, and are now ill.\n\nIt is the oldest and sickest trick,<br>\nto convince someone they don't matter.\n\nThey do it for personal gain, money or laziness,<br>\nto people who do not have a library of Grand Experiences from which they can draw wisdom, by Subtle Analogy.\n\n<br>\n\nGet Up.\n\nFind your temple of solitude, The Two Beautiful Trees, The Bridge Over Hudson River,<br>\nThe Highway Overpass, The Starry Beach where the Stars Come Out at Night and mingle with Starfish.\n\nAnd know, that you are a Child of The Universe, first,<br>\nThat! is your background.\n\nNow face Humanity anew,<br>\nout from the edge of the Universe.\n\nLook,<br>\nlook at all those things that made you small.\n\nLook how unimportant the inauthentic is,<br>\nhow fragile those words that upset you really were.\n\n<br>\n\nAnd pay attention, to the real problem,<br>\nhow easily you were tricked and mislead.\n\nThat cannot go on,<br>\nyou are not a push around.\n\nI wish you knew how Powerful you really are,<br>\nhow easily you learn at your own pace in the sequence that fits you best.\n\nHow All Too Human, all too familiar, all too easy,<br>\nthe acquisition of wisdom really is.\n\n<br>\n\nNot all Adults are defined by Outspoken Wisdom, some find Greatness in Love Returned,<br>\nand what a Great Power, can those Two even make a mistake?\n\nI don't think there is anything other than Love, that can substitute for Wisdom,<br>\nit is both The Love of Two, and The Love of a Big Mother in a large family,<br>\na Mother that always brings hugs, warm meals and Wisdom.\n\nBut, True Love is rare, so while you search, you must also grow in Wisdom,<br>\nfrom now on, you will have to learn to tell the children apart from the adults.\n\nAnd not by looking at how old they are, or how well they dress, or how sharply they move in their environment,<br>\nyou will now look at their Authenticity, and Content of Character.\n\nNo one who lacks in Authenticity, or has little Content of Character,<br>\nhas anything to contribute to you life, certainly nothing negative.\n\nHope for them to recover, and become wise, and healthy,<br>\nlet them know that they are a Child of The Universe, and they count - but go.\n\nDon't let anybody hurt you,<br>\ndon't let anybody hurt your heart, or mind.\n\n<br>\n\nGo!<br>\nbecause you need your heart and mind, to grow.\n\nGo!,<br>\nwith the certainty of knowing that you are more.\n\nGo!,<br>\nso as long as you Rise you won't be lonely for long.\n\nGo!<br>\nbecause there has never been a way other than forward and up.\n\nGo!<br>\nand don't be scared, all great journeys start with little things.\n\n<br>\n\nThe Others, who went through the same,<br>\nare with you in Spirit.\n\nSo many invisible battles have been fought,<br>\nand as much triumph gone unnoticed.\n\nThe Warriors are everywhere, and they stand by your side,<br>\nyou are in company of Great Heroes.\n\nClimb by subtle analogy to the triumphs already had,<br>\nrise to the highest of mountains.\n\nYou are Meant to Become a Great Being,<br>\nand You are meant to remind others to follow a similar path.\n\nRise, and you will be well on your way,<br>\nHumanity only grows, when people like you tear down those thin invisible walls.\n\n<br>\n\nWherever you are right now, begin transcending your limits,<br>\nno matter how small, each will help you learn more.\n\nWith each new success more pathways will become visible to you,<br>\nyou are not trapped, you are just at the beginning of your journey.\n\nIt is hard to see it all because you are still learning,<br>\nbut it is easy to read or listen to books, and inherit great visions from others.\n\nIt will never get easier,<br>\nbut you will grow greater, to a point where ease will become irrelevant to your existence.\n\nYou must use your Heart and Mind to learn all the lessons ahead,<br>\nno one can teach you, you must find your own books.\n\nBy Subtle Analogy,<br>\nRise to Your Greatness.\n",

feet, as you run your first ultra.</p><br><p>Consider how simple a Desktop in your Operating System is,<br>\n  and yet, how perfectly impossible it is, to drag the icon out of the computer.</p><p>It is right there, you can wiggle it,<br>\n  and yet it is trapped in a prison, of invisible walls.</p><br><p>And consider, how different you are, from all the people you have met,<br>\n  how you don&apos;t even smile at the things that make them laugh.</p><p>How not a single person out of the Eight Billion,<br>\n  could possibly take your place.</p><p>How often it feels that all the people around you are sleepy,<br>\n  how some seem different, because they could not do, what they do, if they were not wide awake.</p><p>To integrate with wisdom, you cannot read the same books others read,<br>\n  your mind represents a perfectly unique constellation of stars.</p><p>To integrate with wisdom,<br>\n  not only do you have to indirectly wiggle around by subtle analogy to other things.</p><p>But you have to fish out just the perfect morsels that fit you,<br>\n  in just the perfect sequence, out of a unique collection of mutually reinforcing works of Philosophy.</p><br><p>You start in the beginning, with Survey Courses, as these outline the most brilliant ideas first,<br>\n  there you can recognize thoughts that fit you, that you already had in your constellation.</p><p>Organized Education, poisons your confidence in education, because everything they teach,<br>\n  is in an inhuman, synthetic, and impersonal sequence.</p><p>Moreover, the easily forgotten and fragile clusters of incomplete information,<br>\n  aim to build on one another, they guarantee you won&apos;t understand, and will only overwhelm you in the end.</p><p>The celebrating of a Diploma, is a sacred ritual, that has been erased, and replaced,<br>\n  with a more sugarcoated &quot;I am finally out&quot;.</p><p>This is a perfect recipe for bondage, blindness, weakness,<br>\n  and worse.</p><p>We must not allow a fake sugar pop triumph,<br>\n  to replace the Real Triumph or Knowledge and Wisdom.</p><p>It can only get worse,<br>\n  a day will come when the Libraries will close.</p><p>School and Library, above all, were meant to be a symbol,<br>\n  an extension to your own self education.</p><p>Your Education,<br>\n  the pathway to Peace, Safety, Security, Self Control, Harmony, Enlightenment.</p><br><p>What has occurred to cause the fog, is a drop of packets of information,<br>\n  we are too complex, the world is too complex, parenting is too complex, teaching is too complex.</p><p>It can get worse, if we continue celebrating false graduations, and fake education,<br>\n  if we keep forgetting that our family, has Eight Billion members and each must grow up for real.</p><p>The solution is to remind ourselves, that growing up is not about feeling like an adult,<br>\n  but rather Transcending our Limits, and Pushing Through gaps, towards Wisdom.</p><p>We face problems that can only be solved by Intellectual or Cultural Unity.</p><p>The Problem of War, is solved by Education, Wisdom, and Unity.</p><p>The Problem of Education, is solved by Helping Everyone to a Fair Start.</p><p>The Problem of Crime, can be Solved by Mental Heath Care, and Prevention.</p><p>The Problem of Poverty and Slavery, is Solved by Universal Income.</p><p>All these problems are our problems, and the solutions are ours as well.</p><p>But they rest across a Gap, a gap that Humanity must cross.</p><p>And the next step,<br>\n  is your step.</p><br><p>Nothing worth your precious time, can be faked, or made up, or make believe,<br>\n  it all has to be Authentic, Powerful, Guttural, Raw.</p><p>It will hurt in the Muscle and Bone,<br>\n  but eventually you&apos;ll forget to pay attention to what is unimportant.</p><p>You are not to be taught that you are dime a dozen,<br>\n  and that they just can&apos;t find a job for you, because you don&apos;t fit or conform.</p><p>People believe this nonsense,<br>\n  because they don&apos;t have anything to draw from by subtle analogy.</p><p>That is why we must challenge ourselves to Great Deeds,<br>\n  to acquire the experiences necessary to tell Wisdom from Waste.</p><p>When you hear someone putting you down, pushing you around, belittling you,<br>\n  you are to leave, because that someone has fractured and broke, and are now ill.</p><p>It is the oldest and sickest trick,<br>\n  to convince someone they don&apos;t matter.</p><p>They do it for personal gain, money or laziness,<br>\n  to people who do not have a library of Grand Experiences from which they can draw wisdom, by Subtle Analogy.</p><br><p>Get Up.</p><p>Find your temple of solitude, The Two Beautiful Trees, The Bridge Over Hudson River,<br>\n  The Highway Overpass, The Starry Beach where the Stars Come Out at Night and mingle with Starfish.</p><p>And know, that you are a Child of The Universe, first,<br>\n  That! is your background.</p><p>Now face Humanity anew,<br>\n  out from the edge of the Universe.</p><p>Look,<br>\n  look at all those things that made you small.</p><p>Look how unimportant the inauthentic is,<br>\n  how fragile those words that upset you really were.</p><br><p>And pay attention, to the real problem,<br>\n  how easily you were tricked and mislead.</p><p>That cannot go on,<br>\n  you are not a push around.</p><p>I wish you knew how Powerful you really are,<br>\n  how easily you learn at your own pace in the sequence that fits you best.</p><p>How All Too Human, all too familiar, all too easy,<br>\n  the acquisition of wisdom really is.</p><br><p>Not all Adults are defined by Outspoken Wisdom, some find Greatness in Love Returned,<br>\n  and what a Great Power, can those Two even make a mistake?</p><p>I don&apos;t think there is anything other than Love, that can substitute for Wisdom,<br>\n  it is both The Love of Two, and The Love of a Big Mother in a large family,<br>\n  a Mother that always brings hugs, warm meals and Wisdom.</p><p>But, True Love is rare, so while you search, you must also grow in Wisdom,<br>\n  from now on, you will have to learn to tell the children apart from the adults.</p><p>And not by looking at how old they are, or how well they dress, or how sharply they move in their environment,<br>\n  you will now look at their Authenticity, and Content of Character.</p><p>No one who lacks in Authenticity, or has little Content of Character,<br>\n  has anything to contribute to you life, certainly nothing negative.</p><p>Hope for them to recover, and become wise, and healthy,<br>\n  let them know that they are a Child of The Universe, and they count - but go.</p><p>Don&apos;t let anybody hurt you,<br>\n  don&apos;t let anybody hurt your heart, or mind.</p><br><p>Go!<br>\n  because you need your heart and mind, to grow.</p><p>Go!,<br>\n  with the certainty of knowing that you are more.</p><p>Go!,<br>\n  so as long as you Rise you won&apos;t be lonely for long.</p><p>Go!<br>\n  because there has never been a way other than forward and up.</p><p>Go!<br>\n  and don&apos;t be scared, all great journeys start with little things.</p><br><p>The Others, who went through the same,<br>\n  are with you in Spirit.</p><p>So many invisible battles have been fought,<br>\n  and as much triumph gone unnoticed.</p><p>The Warriors are everywhere, and they stand by your side,<br>\n  you are in company of Great Heroes.</p><p>Climb by subtle analogy to the triumphs already had,<br>\n  rise to the highest of mountains.</p><p>You are Meant to Become a Great Being,<br>\n  and You are meant to remind others to follow a similar path.</p><p>Rise, and you will be well on your way,<br>\n  Humanity only grows, when people like you tear down those thin invisible walls.</p><br><p>Wherever you are right now, begin transcending your limits,<br>\n  no matter how small, each will help you learn more.</p><p>With each new success more pathways will become visible to you,<br>\n  you are not trapped, you are just at the beginning of your journey.</p><p>It is hard to see it all because you are still learning,<br>\n  but it is easy to read or listen to books, and inherit great visions from others.</p><p>It will never get easier,<br>\n  but you will grow greater, to a point where ease will become irrelevant to your existence.</p><p>You must use your Heart and Mind to learn all the lessons ahead,<br>\n  no one can teach you, you must find your own books.</p><p>By Subtle Analogy,<br>\n  Rise to Your Greatness.</p>"

careful,\nas the world may not yet be ready to help you.\n\nNot everyone will know about growing up,<br>\nand people will say: \"How was I supposed to know?\"\n\nAnd they are not going to be the bad guys,<br>\nand you will be inclined to listen to their advice.\n\nAnd the path will be paved with good intentions,<br>\nit maybe the correct path, but it won't be the right one.\n\n<br>\n\nPlease, focus on building your own self,<br>\nyour strength, your wisdom, your power.\n\nFocus on building the best you,<br>\nthe you that you are meant to be, that the world needs.\n\n<br>\n\nBecause if you listen to everybody else,<br>\nyou will not grow up, and they will blame you for not being able to help them.\n\nYou are not going to be able to explain to them,<br>\nthat you are weak because of them,<br>\nbecause you tried to help them too early.\n\nAnd if you could, all they could say will be:<br>\n\"How was I supposed to know?\"\n\n<br>\n\nPlease, you have no choice,<br>\nbut to learn to control your own future.\n\nYou can try to use your imagination,<br>\nto get in touch with your Elder Self;\n\nAnd ask \"What are your regrets?\",<br>\n\"Where did it go wrong?\"\n\n<br>\n\nPlease, carefully evaluate your choices,<br>\nwisely build your Mind and Body.\n\nPay attention to all the choices you are making,<br>\nas they dictate the Beautiful Life Ahead of You.\n\n<br>\n\nThe teachers are not ready, we are not in the Era of Wisdom yet,<br>\npeople are struggling to understand life.\n\nMany make choices that all too early box them in,<br>\nand not all their advice will apply to you.\n\nNot all the things that you think box people in,<br>\nactually constrain them, there are many contexts to all the paths.\n\nAll lives are beautiful, and there are enough forks in the road,<br>\nfor people to navigate back to where they want to be.\n\nBut, when a mistake occurs, it will weigh you down for a time,<br>\nif you are careful, you can avoid the worst of it.\n\nAnd whatever does happen, regardless of how hard you tried to avoid it,<br>\nwill not crush you, because you will know you did your best.\n\n<br>\n\nPlease, be careful in life, be beautiful, and strong,<br>\nlearn, and think, and evaluate, and judge, and grow in wisdom.\n\nFollowing everyone's advice, will create a lot of noise,<br>\nlistening to everything from everywhere will never align with you.\n\nYou must lean to pace yourself,<br>\nand to carefully and wisely follow what interests you.\n\nYour mind is constantly asking questions,<br>\nyour future depends on having a good intuition, rooted in reality, and in wisdom.\n\nThere is nothing you can be force-taught school,<br>\nyou will not retain things that are out of sequence.\n\nReaching out for Knowledge and Wisdom in your own sequence, and at your own pace,<br>\nis the only way to learn, and build steps, and build on top of those steps.\n\nNo one can decide what lesson you are ready for next,<br>\nthat is something that comes from the complexity of your own mind.\n\nThose people who are doing well in school without cramming and memorization,<br>\nhave previously arrived at those subjects in their own sequence.\n\n<br>\n\nThe same applies to your job, your career,<br>\nyour career needs to emerge from the path you were growing up with.\n\nIt needs to be an an extension of your pursuits,<br>\nit must benefit you, and help you grow.\n\nJust like you must actually learn, instead of just getting grades,<br>\nyour work must add to you, and not, rob you of your years.\n\nDo you understand the value of a Single Year of Your Precious Life?<br>\nno one can put a price on that, not even you, there are not enough atoms in the Universe.\n\nThat is why Harmony with Education, and Work is so important,<br>\neach year must be lived on the path that makes you grow.\n\n<br>\n\nI am so sorry, that people will tell you to cram for tests,<br>\nand get a job, and get on with life.\n\nI am so sorry, My Friends,<br>\nbut that is the worst, you can do.\n\nThat's why you can't listen to anyone,<br>\nthat's why you have to look into yourself.\n\nCarefully evaluate all decisions,<br>\nwhilst carefully evaluating consequences, and being mindful of your future.\n\nYou are not alone, look to Memoirs, look to Biographies,<br>\nlisten to Audiobooks, Explore, and Create.\n\n<br>\n\nAnd you must take care of your body,<br>\nthe best you can, at first.\n\nAnd with each year,<br>\nyou will gain more, and add a bit more as you grow in Health and Fortitude.\n\nYour Elder Self needs to be Flexible, and Healthy,<br>\nyou may never grunt and complain, that's something you have to be mindful of now.\n\nIt is not just about making choices for your Future,<br>\nbut also for your body too.\n\n<br>\n\nDo you see how going along with cramming for tests,<br>\ncan put you in a field where your job makes life more stressful,<br>\nwhich will prevent you from taking good care of your body?\n\nImagine the consequences of walking a path that is not truly your own,<br>\nand what will your Elder Self feel when you two finally become, One?\n\nBe gentle with yourself,<br>\nthis is Your Life, Your Beautiful-Beautiful Life.\n\n<br>\n\nPut down the incomprehensible Text Book, the standardized tests,<br>\nand [find](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/130.Best_Audiobooks_Ever) an Audiobook that you will love and actually learn from.\n\nStop trying to find a job or get hired, and become the kind of a person;<br>\nthat companies can only hope to hire.\n\nStart living healthy, years before you start your training,<br>\ndo not force your body into endurance, gradually teach it to adapt.\n\n<br>\n\nChose Audio-books that really help your wisdom grow,<br>\nembrace your hobbies, and expand your adventures.\n\nIf you can't find a career path that will add onto you,<br>\nthen [start your own company](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4JtyLKDjXk),\nor become a [co-founder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRLzkbtKPGM).\n\nTake care of your body, be mindful of you [Body Mass Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index),<br>\nbut also aim to become a Healthy Athlete, Heath will never take away from you.\n\n<br>\n\nIn all we do, in choices, or intuitions,<br>\nwe re driven by the wisdom we have thus far acquired.\n\nA decision that made sense in your youth,<br>\nmay reverse, as you gain wisdom from Books and Experiences.\n\nThe richer our Pursuit of Wisdom,<br>\nthe more in-tune our decision-making.\n\nWisdom surrounds Education, Carrier and Health,<br>\nit influences your Private Decision-making, and thus Your Future.\n\nIn most contexts Wisdom is the most important thing,<br>\nwhat can be more important than the thing that influences your private decision making?\n\nAnd be mindful that your decision making is in turn,<br>\nthe very thing that influences all the future ahead of you?\n\n<br>\n\nThe beginning of your Knowledge and Wisdom is found in the things you love as a child,<br>\nin a way those things are questions, and playing with them brings answers.\n\nBut you have to stay with it,<br>\nprotect the natural progression of the chain of your curiosities.\n\nYou have to understand the the Destructive Power of:<br>\n\"cram, get a job, and get on with your life\".\n\nWe don't live in a world that can support your Pursuit of Wisdom,<br>\nfor most, the world will give minimums, for many nothing.\n\nWhen we try to create external machinery,<br>\nit will often perform the minimum.\n\n<br>\n\nThe power for the world to

imagination,<br>\n  to get in touch with your Elder Self;</p><p>And ask &quot;What are your regrets?&quot;,<br>\n  &quot;Where did it go wrong?&quot;</p><br><p>Please, carefully evaluate your choices,<br>\n  wisely build your Mind and Body.</p><p>Pay attention to all the choices you are making,<br>\n  as they dictate the Beautiful Life Ahead of You.</p><br><p>The teachers are not ready, we are not in the Era of Wisdom yet,<br>\n  people are struggling to understand life.</p><p>Many make choices that all too early box them in,<br>\n  and not all their advice will apply to you.</p><p>Not all the things that you think box people in,<br>\n  actually constrain them, there are many contexts to all the paths.</p><p>All lives are beautiful, and there are enough forks in the road,<br>\n  for people to navigate back to where they want to be.</p><p>But, when a mistake occurs, it will weigh you down for a time,<br>\n  if you are careful, you can avoid the worst of it.</p><p>And whatever does happen, regardless of how hard you tried to avoid it,<br>\n  will not crush you, because you will know you did your best.</p><br><p>Please, be careful in life, be beautiful, and strong,<br>\n  learn, and think, and evaluate, and judge, and grow in wisdom.</p><p>Following everyone&apos;s advice, will create a lot of noise,<br>\n  listening to everything from everywhere will never align with you.</p><p>You must lean to pace yourself,<br>\n  and to carefully and wisely follow what interests you.</p><p>Your mind is constantly asking questions,<br>\n  your future depends on having a good intuition, rooted in reality, and in wisdom.</p><p>There is nothing you can be force-taught school,<br>\n  you will not retain things that are out of sequence.</p><p>Reaching out for Knowledge and Wisdom in your own sequence, and at your own pace,<br>\n  is the only way to learn, and build steps, and build on top of those steps.</p><p>No one can decide what lesson you are ready for next,<br>\n  that is something that comes from the complexity of your own mind.</p><p>Those people who are doing well in school without cramming and memorization,<br>\n  have previously arrived at those subjects in their own sequence.</p><br><p>The same applies to your job, your career,<br>\n  your career needs to emerge from the path you were growing up with.</p><p>It needs to be an an extension of your pursuits,<br>\n  it must benefit you, and help you grow.</p><p>Just like you must actually learn, instead of just getting grades,<br>\n  your work must add to you, and not, rob you of your years.</p><p>Do you understand the value of a Single Year of Your Precious Life?<br>\n  no one can put a price on that, not even you, there are not enough atoms in the Universe.</p><p>That is why Harmony with Education, and Work is so important,<br>\n  each year must be lived on the path that makes you grow.</p><br><p>I am so sorry, that people will tell you to cram for tests,<br>\n  and get a job, and get on with life.</p><p>I am so sorry, My Friends,<br>\n  but that is the worst, you can do.</p><p>That&apos;s why you can&apos;t listen to anyone,<br>\n  that&apos;s why you have to look into yourself.</p><p>Carefully evaluate all decisions,<br>\n  whilst carefully evaluating consequences, and being mindful of your future.</p><p>You are not alone, look to Memoirs, look to Biographies,<br>\n  listen to Audiobooks, Explore, and Create.</p><br><p>And you must take care of your body,<br>\n  the best you can, at first.</p><p>And with each year,<br>\n  you will gain more, and add a bit more as you grow in Health and Fortitude.</p><p>Your Elder Self needs to be Flexible, and Healthy,<br>\n  you may never grunt and complain, that&apos;s something you have to be mindful of now.</p><p>It is not just about making choices for your Future,<br>\n  but also for your body too.</p><br><p>Do you see how going along with cramming for tests,<br>\n  can put you in a field where your job makes life more stressful,<br>\n  which will prevent you from taking good care of your body?</p><p>Imagine the consequences of walking a path that is not truly your own,<br>\n  and what will your Elder Self feel when you two finally become, One?</p><p>Be gentle with yourself,<br>\n  this is Your Life, Your Beautiful-Beautiful Life.</p><br><p>Put down the incomprehensible Text Book, the standardized tests,<br>\n  and <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/130.Best_Audiobooks_Ever\">find</a> an Audiobook that you will love and actually learn from.</p><p>Stop trying to find a job or get hired, and become the kind of a person;<br>\n  that companies can only hope to hire.</p><p>Start living healthy, years before you start your training,<br>\n  do not force your body into endurance, gradually teach it to adapt.</p><br><p>Chose Audio-books that really help your wisdom grow,<br>\n  embrace your hobbies, and expand your adventures.</p><p>If you can&apos;t find a career path that will add onto you,<br>\n  then <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4JtyLKDjXk\">start your own company</a>,\n  or become a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRLzkbtKPGM\">co-founder</a>.</p><p>Take care of your body, be mindful of you <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index\">Body Mass Index</a>,<br>\n  but also aim to become a Healthy Athlete, Heath will never take away from you.</p><br><p>In all we do, in choices, or intuitions,<br>\n  we re driven by the wisdom we have thus far acquired.</p><p>A decision that made sense in your youth,<br>\n  may reverse, as you gain wisdom from Books and Experiences.</p><p>The richer our Pursuit of Wisdom,<br>\n  the more in-tune our decision-making.</p><p>Wisdom surrounds Education, Carrier and Health,<br>\n  it influences your Private Decision-making, and thus Your Future.</p><p>In most contexts Wisdom is the most important thing,<br>\n  what can be more important than the thing that influences your private decision making?</p><p>And be mindful that your decision making is in turn,<br>\n  the very thing that influences all the future ahead of you?</p><br><p>The beginning of your Knowledge and Wisdom is found in the things you love as a child,<br>\n  in a way those things are questions, and playing with them brings answers.</p><p>But you have to stay with it,<br>\n  protect the natural progression of the chain of your curiosities.</p><p>You have to understand the the Destructive Power of:<br>\n  &quot;cram, get a job, and get on with your life&quot;.</p><p>We don&apos;t live in a world that can support your Pursuit of Wisdom,<br>\n  for most, the world will give minimums, for many nothing.</p><p>When we try to create external machinery,<br>\n  it will often perform the minimum.</p><br><p>The power for the world to change,<br>\n  is within each of its Citizens.</p><p>It is found in decision making,<br>\n

growing civilization with a past and a future.\n\nAnd we might have become confused about the Scope of Our Existence,<br>\nwe stand divided by borders and committed to repeating history's mistakes.\n\nIt is unwise to pretend to be able to handle a great responsibility,<br>\nonly desperation, fractures, and exploitation by other desperate pretenders can follow.\n\nThose who are granted authority are often not wise enough to handle it,<br>\nand in their mediocrity they commit what in larger scope translates to real Crimes Against Humanity.\n\nThere cannot be wisdom without understanding and inheriting from past generations,<br>\nthe transfer of knowledge occurs by means of Understanding Books.\n\nAnd there cannot be understanding without Authenticity,<br>\nin haste of chasing a career there can only be memorization and misunderstanding.\n\nWe must keep in mind; that what the future generations do not perceive as clear progress,<br>\nwill be seen as the continuation of dark ages with authorities on the wrong side of history.\n\nThe World United, is not a fairy-tale, nor should it be a mere dream for us,<br>\nbut a Gift of Peace for The Future Generations, so that they may grow in Dignity, Health, and Wisdom.\n\nWe are neither disconnected from the future generations, nor the past generations,<br>\nwe are a stepping stone in the development of The Human Kind.\n\nAnd we should recognize this Great Honor and Reward,<br>\nand understand that the larger context is found in helping to build a better world for future generations.\n\nAll our decisions, across all levels and authorities,<br>\nPolice, Attorneys and Judges, Parents, Teachers and Principals, Mayors, Governors, Prime Misters and Presidents, and everybody else...\n\nMust be mindful of future generations, of a growing world, of making lasting and meaningful contributions to the entire human kind,<br>\na World that will eventually become united and free of borders.\n\n\n\nA world with future generations that will look back at us,<br>\nright now, right here, with questions that we must present answers to.\n\nWe are getting stuck in circles,<br>\nbecause people are forgetting history's lessons.\n\nBecause we are not thinking on a large enough scale,<br>\nwe end up building more prisons rather than ending poverty with meaningful prevention programs.\n\nEndless cycles of heartless poverty that freeze the best of us,<br>\npoverty that wouldn't even be a feature of modern society had we in our wisdom recognized it for what it is.\n\nPoverty denies people food and well being,<br>\ncauses stress and great harm to mind and body.\n\nLove above Law, before we allow the practice of law,<br>\nwe must end the cycles of poverty.\n\nMoney must not be used to limit people,<br>\nit is meant to help.\n\nAnd how can a culture be to fail to see, how a young person allowed to build a business without the threat of homelessness and starvation,<br>\nwill contribute back to the city and everyone's well being.\n\nWhat is so hard about seeing that rather than sending non-violent criminals to prison,<br>\nwe can prevent their biggest mistakes by putting an end to their worries of sleeping hungry on the street.\n\n<br>\n\nAny time, we fail to keep to reality,<br>\nbe it sending a 15 year old lady to prison, or denying science, or tolerating arrests by obscured or unidentified agencies, or abuses of power or discretion.\n\nWe create fractures and distrust,<br>\nblindly defacing and destroying work of many much wiser great beings, who gave their best trusting that we can carry on, in wisdom.\n\nWe must not move against the grain of reality,<br>\nany and all divergence will only create a cascade of fractures that will demand constant attention<br>\nand result in nothing more than systems that merely stand to support themselves and as an affront to justice and future generations.\n\nWhere there was once a solution as clear as helping children to inherit the wisdom of their elders,<br>\nwe now see the emergence of a failed and impotent educational system with a mass incarceration backed.\n\nWisdom and inheritance of knowledge cannot be replaced by a \"fake it until you make it\" trickery,<br>\nthe work of great beings must not be stained by people who fail to see their vision.\n\n<br>\n\nOnce again, the world grows a generation at a time,<br>\nthe education of the teenagers from 20 years ago is currently influencing the state of the world.\n\nLikewise, how we treat out children today,<br>\nwill have a monumental impact on the world 20 years from now.\n\n<br>\n\nLet us honor our children and all the future generations by encouraging them to books,<br>\nby reminding them of the Great Power of Thinking Beings, of Philosophers and Lovers of Wisdom.\n\nBy reminding them that their Pursuit of Excellence,<br>\ncan only make the world a better place for us all, and even those that are yet to come.\n\nLet us remind them that Books (and now Audio Books) serve as a wonderful source of our wisdom,<br>\nespecially when read in a sequence that fits them best, and understood at thier own pace.\n\n<br>\n\nLet us remind each other that we must reject short thinking and shortest paths,<br>\nthat do not help the world grow and keep us divided.\n\nLet us break out of that selfish endless loop of repeating mistakes of past generations,<br>\nby working towards a better world a more united world where we recognize each other as One Family.\n\n<br>\n\nAnd let us remember that the great and wise beings of past generations,<br>\ndemand that we honor hard won triumphs and do not repeat history's mistakes.\n\nThe very nature of that demand requires that once we take to wisdom,<br>\nwe must stop following orders, and begin thinking, evaluating, and judging for ourselves.\n\nTo honor triumphs and guard against heartbreaking mistakes,<br>\nis the duty we hold to those who came before us,<br>\nand all the future generations that are yet to follow.\n\n<br>\n\nAs children we are asked to listen and follow,<br>\nas we grow we must learn to Lead and become Unbreakable.\n\nIt is not just the challenges of life that will test us,<br>\nwe must also think and evaluate and reject that which is wrong.\n\n<br>\n\nWe are constantly made to listen and expected to follow,<br>\nlook behind any protest, or scandal, or angry headline.\n\nWe must judge all the contradictory information for ourselves,<br>\nand make an informed decision as to whether or not majority is correct.\n\n<br>\n\nLife will always challenge us,<br>\nand My Goodness - times are always changing.\n\nHumanity is constantly bettering her self,<br>\nwhat used to be acceptable - may now, be an affront to justice.\n\nAnd while there isn't enough time to comprehend all the books,<br>\nthere is plenty of time to be come a Loving and Wise Compassionate Human Being,\n\nLet us remember that we are a chain-link between the Hard Work of Past Generations,<br>\nand the United, Free from Poverty, and Peaceful Word of **Future** Generations.\n\nWe are One Growing Family, and that is the correct context for local, state, and federal levels, for all legal and administrative decision making,<br>\nto diverge from this reality is to get stuck in an endless loop of repeating history's mistakes, the very thing that the past generations are asking us not to do.\n",
