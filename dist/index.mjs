  "![Illustration](image/poetry-0071-illustration.jpg) [Listen](audio/poetry-0071.mp3) Like steps on a mountain, each epoch stands in support of the next,<br> like the pages of a journal, together, they hold the sacred text. We learn, we may fail, or triumph, and the next epoch follows,<br> but every new epoch grows from the one previous. We can't leap from one place to another,<br> we can only move up, or graduate up, or build up, or step up. To leap, is to stay a child in an aging body,<br> to go up, to grow up, and carry on to no end, is to become an adult. <br><br> In our youth we must learn to stand our ground,<br> and anchor ourselves to something that moves us. As we age, having followed that path,<br> we'll be standing upon our own mountain, A great mountain of personal wisdom,<br> where once only a direction lay. These mountains rise with each epoch in our life,<br> every once in a while we pause, to bring all that we are together - higher. Epoch by Epoch, we ascend, we can already see the sunshine,<br> but our journey comes with no end. <br><br> This is a simple life, first we conform and then break away,<br> we become wise, and later in life, our wisdom transforms into Enlightenment. It is a road of Adventures, Books, Poems, and Inspirations,<br> it has tears of sadness, but in return we grow stronger. What it is all for, is to Live a Life of Simple Dignity,<br> or rising when we fall, of learning when we get tricked. Of protecting our bodies and minds, and growing stronger,<br> of adding to our existing body of wisdom. <br><br> With each epoch we climb over what we previously thought were our limits,<br> As we get up, and stand up, we reach a new plateau. We rest, we take in the sun of this new height,<br> and get busy building higher, and higher. None of us begged to be born, we were nothingness,<br> and temporarily all these atoms came together to give us, ourselves. And eventually, we'll return to our nothingness,<br> and the atoms will disperse, to become parts of other beautiful things, <br><br> While we are in this state, however, the first and foremost order!<br> ...is to Thrive, to Grow, to Expand, to Rise, to Build, and to Ascend. Whether we know it yet or not, the road that we are on, is one.<br> It is the same road that our 90 year old selves will wonder about. They will go up and down the Epochs, and ask questions.<br> there will be some regrets, but we do have a chance to solve them now. There will be enough triumph to bring blinding light to all the sadness,<br> and the beautiful memories will wipe out all the unimportant things. <br><br> All that stands in the way of our growing up,<br> must be pushed aside, growing up is our life. We must grow up, rise up, all the way up.<br> Each and every epoch ahead, demands this. Our minds require wisdom, wisdom fuels our decision making,<br> and our choices dictate all our life ahead. Life is precious, it is to be lived in Dignity and Authenticity,<br> and you are meant to become a Great Being. *** [Everest photo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Everest#/media/File:Sunrise_over_Everest.jpg): [author](https://www.flickr.com/people/69342394@N00), [license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/).",

Then there are the occasional mad deer,<br> always shimmy-shammying around like they had a beer. The coyotes are especially frightening,<br> they come in groups, flashing their eyes like lightening. One time I tried to turn on a flashlight,<br> as it turned out - to all the big spider's delight. Let me tell ya, It takes a man with a lot of brass,<br> not to scream, when a spider crawls out with a huge glowing ass. <br><br> Once, an older lady from a near by camp went to get more booze from her car,<br> and then misjudged her distance, and walked back too far. I was sleeping on the ground in my tiny tent,<br> and then all of a sudden she started yelling out in her lost torment. Of course, in the middle of the night, and woods and my sleep,<br> she didn't sound like a lady but rather some huge creepy creep. She found her way back, and I am sure they partied hard,<br> but not knowing what made all those screams, I slept - on guard. <br><br> Porcupines, oh, you've never seen one like I did,<br> it was huge, covered in spikes, and really fit. It could outrun a car or two,<br> probably, bite a tire and chew. But then I came across a sign,<br> and it turned out that the biggest creature, was not the Porcupine, I was always pretty happy that none of the creatures that bite,<br> could actually take me down in a single swipe. But the sign read, **Beware Of Bear**<br> and that to me was the biggest scare.",

I had no idea what they were saying,<br> but waiving their hands, it was a danger they were portraying.

We have something now, my Dear Friend.<br> We have Internet Lectures, Audio Books, and Start-up Incubators. No teacher can teach you better than failing at your first start-up,<br> no teacher can bring you with more wisdom, than failing at your first start-up. You can go, so as long as you can do it better yourself.<br> So as long as your aim is Greatness.

Prepare your Audio Books wisely,<br> and do not forget YouTube Lectures. You'll need investors,<br> and although, all your parents put together make quite an investor. You need to approach the pros,<br> and listen carefully as they will proud to help all of you. People believe in authenticity,<br> investors know what kind of student stays, and what kind of student leaves. All those failures that were crushing you in school,<br> are worth their weight in gold when building a new school. <br><br> Research Homeschooling and Un-schooling, bring your friends,<br> if your parents keep yelling, find someone more worthy of you. Parents are not gods, they make mistakes,<br> they are scared of responsibilities, scared of unknown. Don't let the yelling get to you,<br> they need to learn to communicate their ideas better. <br><br> Whatever fails you, Your Friends, Your School, Your Parents,<br> It means you got to go - or they got to go - or you won't be able to grow. Lack of education, is a terrible curse,<br> bough on by bad schools, bad parents, and bad friends; First it will make you blind,<br> and then you will lose your mind. That's probably,<br> how slavery worked. Whatever is interfering with your Real Education,<br> is attacking you, cheating you of wisdom, freedom, independence. You cannot agree to this, You have to rise,<br> rise against stupidity, bondage, and slavery. If everyone failed you,<br> then the universe has called upon you to become your teacher. When you grow up,<br> walking out of that charade, will be your favorite story to tell. Your listeners will be the same age you were,<br> the books you loved, will become the books they'll love too. You will set them free,<br> help them to wisdom, help them to independence. Learn, so that you can become a Successful Entrepreneur,<br> find your start at Start-up Accelerators. Go there early, as failure is a powerful teacher.<br> Show them your Hunger, show them how much you have learned on your own. Set yourself free,<br> a life without wisdom is slavery. Teach your Investors what a Good Book really does,<br> help their employees to discover knowledge, to hunger for more. Would you, as a Powerful Great Businessperson,<br> take the diploma you are working on, seriously? Seriously?<br> Or would you see a child waiving a little flag,<br> hoping to squeeze in, if there is room for one more. <br><br> Why do you need teachers anyway,<br> they can only stand between you and the Great Beings. Find a road less traveled, find the more grassy patch,<br> bring a Picnic Basket, Audio Books, and Video Lectures. Let That Be Your Classrom,<br> and let your future be made by you.

Jogging is difficult,<br> because you should dance first. Dancing and walking,<br> are lovely at making you a Jogger.

If you don't fight back, you will always lose,<br> and if you stay in the dark, you will only add to the darkness. There cannot be a compromise between good and evil,<br> a compromise only takes from the good, and only give s to the evil. Your office window, is not a substitute for a Call to the Wild,<br> Your next promotion does not actually make you a greater person. A vacation, cannot set you free, it is not a substitute for nature.<br> Dressing beautifully, has never made a person truly beautiful. Waiting for that perfect someone, will not help them notice you.<br> Trusting that someone else will help you, is just another delay. And just getting out there, is not enough to be understood.<br> And going out, following friends, can only put you on somebody else's path. Life is not hard, it only gets complicated when you follow,<br> because by following you just end up in places you don't understand. You must lead. And you must keep walking forward. Your own step, after your own step.<br> In your own direction, towards the things that move you, only then can You be Trully Moved. It must the correct combination of books, poems, steps, events, summers, and epochs.<br> Do not try to hurry, do not change roads, only move up, only think, and envision, and grow. That which leads to Your Greatness, to Your Freedom, to Your Nature, requires, Truth.<br> Walk your own path at your own pace. Only the correct key, can set your mind free. The others who seem to have it all right.<br> Often get lost on alien paths, and merely put on a happy face. While it seems like you are trapped today, you are not, it is just an illusion.<br> Look towards the car keys. That is all it will take. Grab the keys and go.<br> It will be very difficult at first. The toxic build up that is keeping you from getting up, right now,<br> takes three days to crumble. It is a heavy cage. But there is a way.<br> A simple way. Grab the keys, and go... i275 south, merge onto 75 south,<br> and take it all the way down... Florida Keys, US Highway One. If you live in Florida, then you are headed for Michigan's Upper Peninsula.<br> If you live West, your destination is all the way East. It is not the destination, it is the Journey, my Friend.<br> Take your time, watch the cage crumble and fade as you go. Only the important things, will stay.<br> And you'll get to see yourself again. And you'll get to be free again,<br> you will resume where you left of. A life of bondage,<br> is not worthy of you. Life is not meant to be a cage, or cruel, or frighten you.<br> You knew this as a child, and you let that slip away, not even noticing when it went. It is your Right to resist being pushed into places that you don't want to be in.<br> It is your Right to reject conditions that you never agreed to, that you were pushed into. How else can the Universe be worthy of us, how else can our lives be beautiful.<br> Heaven and Paradise are real, but they are now, right now. Now. How can people love you, when your own love for yourself is slipping away.<br> You have to. You have to accept the responsibility for your Health, and Dignity. You don't have to make it all the way, the first time,<br> and you don't have to leave your phone behind. You can call this therapy, or a vision quest, you can call it a road trip.<br> You are not allowed to live in a cage, of whatever constitution, that will make you ill. It comes to you naturally to take care of your body,<br> but your mind also requires care. When you reach your Freedom, you'll know what to do next,<br> it can be another trip, East, or West. If you feel trapped, the Universe is darker for it.<br> Take a week. Or two. Forty days is best. call it your Quarantine. Unless you clear you mind, and focus on what is important,<br> on you and those worthy of your care, you will lose it. You will forget the beautiful person you truly are,<br> you will fall from heaven, and forget about paradise. And life will turn into a black and white TV show.<br> You must take good care of your mind. If there is no one else that cares about you,<br> then look at this poem. I care.<br> Hi! I am, speaking for you!<br> grab the keys, or bicycle, or comfy shoes, and go. Go, and never again, let go. Your health is important.<br> Your well being is important. A Human Being is Meant to Learn,<br> A Human Being is Meant to Rise. You are meant to filled with Wisdom,<br> with Joy and Love of Life. You are meant to Laugh,<br> Truly Fully Laugh.

You can learn anything you want, there are no smarter.<br> They are just actors, with a handful of fragile lessons, crafted to impress. There is nothing that can break you, there are no stronger.<br> Look to the source of the pain, it comes from Innocence. Nothing rooted in Innocence is ugly, all lessons that come from being tricked,<br> add up to make you more beautiful, enable your insight and foresight, and fuel your authenticity. When the regrets come at night, that's just you brain asking you,<br> to think harder, to comprehend your beauty in full, No one can trick you, not for long enough. So, don't be scared.<br> Memoirs, Audio-books, Lectures will show you how many better people there are. We all have to Enlarge our Worlds daily.<br> Audiobooks, and Lectures, will show you that all you have met thus far were just the same type of person. Do not be afraid to rise. The people, or person you have long though about, exist.<br> But before they can see you, you have to rise, and shine, and be seen. Don't be scared. Those who will use your Love, Innocence, Endurance and Generosity against you,<br> have long been lost, they are blinded, and fractured, and damaged, and broken. They hold no power over you. If their attacks continue they will grind themselves to dust,<br> and all the experiences that will be left in their wake, will make you stronger and better. Battles make you stronger, smarter, more beautiful.<br> You are a Warrior, that's the oldest name for it. A Warrior is She that uses the harm that came her way as energy,<br> who understands none can stay a child and all must grow, and enlarge their worlds. A Warrior can never be damaged, or hurt -- a Warrior Learns.<br> A Warrior resists tears in the rain, just like she can resist weakness. We live in a fragile world, full of fragile people, with fragile egos,<br> they speak fragile advice, with fragile words; from their fragile hills. A Warrior does not wait to be taught.<br> A Warrior learns fastest on her own. Learn in the sequence that fits you best,<br> learn at the pace that helps you most. Push the dark imaginings back,<br> and rise. Move your hand.<br> And push up.<br> And stand up. Get ready to walk,<br> and then run, day, after day, slightly longer. And then lift your weights, the way you learned to run,<br> and then lift for longer, and never rest. And then, with your sweetest audio-book. Step.<br> Step Up.<br> Rise Up.<br> To No End. This is The Life Of A Warrior. Nothing Can Crush You,<br> Nothing Can Hold You. Don't You See? Everything Makes You Stronger,<br> Everything Makes You Fight Longer. You,<br> Are A Warrior.",

  "[Listen](audio/poetry-0030.mp3) Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Twenty Five, Yesterday, Bernie dropped out. I didn't even try to wait, you can't place this much weight. And what were we expecting? It has always been like this, hit and miss. It is time for all, to rise. Become a Citizen of The World. In your own hands. With your own mind. Seek Knowledge and Triumph. Let the name of this New Nation be, Earth, May the Citizen be called, a Human. The power is in your hands, so near, rooted in every audio-book you can hear. And you have to lean to rise, you can't near the skies, without your eyes! When you have learned enough, you have to turn around and teach. Yell from your mountain, scream, dance and preach. The promise of Freedom, Reason, and Peace, is in our hands, it is our Masterpiece. Education is [fun](http://catpea.com/warrior) it only ever seems hard, because one is trying to learn too much in too little time. The only way we can fully learn, is by inheriting knowledge from World's most beloved Heroes. This inheritance begins by following in their footstep, first; and continues, when we break away to resume where they left off. Rise, rise to the mountains before you. The only way, is to go up, to grow up, to grow all the way up, until we each become a Great Being. Same as those before us, same as those that are sure to rise. Open Your Eyes. The Time is Always Now.",
  "[Listen](audio/poetry-0029.mp3) Captain's Log, Quarantine Serserge, Day Twenty Four, I am ready to jump into my bed like a big dinosaur. I am dressed, I am wearing my favorite workout clothes, I stretched left and right, and fluffed up my pillows. For tonight, I prepared, a Bill Bryson Auidobook I adore, Even though I am already so sleepy that I could snore. I will listen about the [History of the World](https://www.audible.com/pd/A-Short-History-of-Nearly-Everything-Audiobook/B002V0KFPW), about all the mysterious things and places we explored. This is how I go to sleep every night, the book will slowly play... until daylight. I learned so much from online lectures and audio books, that these days, I can focus on my good looks. Oh, how I miss working out at the gym, but I am still working hard to be slim. Let us all be of good cheer, quarantine will be over soon, that is clear.",
  "[Listen](audio/poetry-0028.mp3) Captain's Log, Quarantine Fiveever, Day Twenty Three. It was a super busy day, not a moment for tea. And I keep Programming late into the night, typing like a Lion with all his might. This morn, I woke up and made Peanut Butter and Jelly, I've been programming all day, I keep going like the telly. Now, I am trying to figure out, a datatype for verse, my stanza CSS padding and margins are intense. I am not trying to be a hero, hey! but I am writing this, in a [JavaScript Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)! I don't know if there is anymore I can say, other than that I am OK, and that this has been an OK day. No wait, I'll add this: I wish everyone pure bliss!",
  "Captain's Log, Eternal, Quarantine, Day Twenty Two. Eeeeek! It's raining, I am trying not to be complaining.<br> But the sky is no longer blue, what am I to do? Each time I sneeze, the power goes out,<br> not to say my sneezes are not petite, or that I am ill! No, I am perfectly fine, I don't need to blow my nose.<br> It is the transformer outside that blows! Frantically, atomically I hit CTRL+S, CTRL+S, save, save.

  "Captain's Log: Quarantine. Day Twenty One. There is birdsong outside, and I can feel the sun. I woke up rested, for the first time, in years. My mind was hardly ever tired, but all the rest needed time. I am ready for gyms to reopen, It will be so much fun. I will dance even faster, workout longer. My diet is twice as good as it was before, including soup, and proper portion control. It took twenty one days, for my body to begin recovering from my workouts. What a great sadness it would be, to wish now, that I should have danced, or tried harder. Instead, here I am. Bouncy, and perky as heck, Ready to go back. Use your days wisely, let no day slip away. Live, make each day count, it all adds together, balance your account. What makes us great, is the sum of all the days in the past. What makes us strong, is making each day better than the one before. Make each day count, enlarge your world.",
  "Captain's Log: Quarantine. Day Twenty, the promised day of rhyme a plenty. I am sitting here with my salad, expecting to write world's littlest ballad. I waited until the conclusion of day, to see with what rhymes that may pay. Alas, twenty just about rhymes with plenty, it rhymes as good as yeti and orange. On the other hand Twenty One, rhymes with all under the sun. I am sitting here smacking my lips, Counting down 90 days to Penumbral Eclipse. I made little sausages to add to my salad, I added really spicy dressing to spruce up my ballad. ![A](image/poetry-0025-a.jpg) My Little Fort (note orange tent in the center) As I grilled the little things, I remembered that same smell, it was back when I lived in the ancient dune wilderness. ![X](image/poetry-0025-x.jpg) Little Sausage Dinner That memory really rings a bell, It was at the height of my loneliness. ![B](image/poetry-0025-b.jpg) My Evening Couch, as I waited for Lake Michigan Sunsets Deep woods, ancient dunes, and warm and sunny afternoons. ![K](image/poetry-0025-k.jpg) Deep in Woods Not all afternoons were sunny, I once got a heck of a reminder, One cold afternoon I remembered that I get scared of thunder. ![C](image/poetry-0025-c.jpg) And My Evening Wear Not, little thunder of course, the scary ones, that always strike with great force. ![T](image/poetry-0025-t.jpg) Dark Evening It was almost never scary, certainly never scary for long, it would pass, and moon or sun would rise, followed by birdsong. ![H](image/poetry-0025-h.jpg) People taking photos of my Horses I remember by the beach many stood, as I built horses out of driftwood, ![I](image/poetry-0025-i.jpg) Horse 2.0 ![J](image/poetry-0025-j.jpg) Horse 3.0 The height of my loneliness, also came with a great deal of silliness, ![L](image/poetry-0025-l.jpg) Beach House ![M](image/poetry-0025-m.jpg) Beach House I waived to the future, and to today, Look at me, I am a Cowboy!

  "Captain's Log: Day Nineteen of Quarantine. Tomorrow, day twenty may have rhyme a plenty, but it won't rhyme with quarantine, and that was unforeseen. I waited all day to write, to see if something interesting may bite. I wanted to draw and paint, and dance and prance, but ended up discovering a new [poem about taking chance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6_QUhUPrF4). I ended up programming, music and art, I aimed to do something relaxing, but smart. Such are meow days, and had been forever and more, searching for all things special and all the things I adore. Now, I am finishing today's poem, one foot already in bed, Though I already had my salad, I wonder if I should make some bread. That's sounds about right, I'll waddle downstairs and grab a bite. Goodnight.",
  "Captain's Log: Day Eighteen of Quarantine. Researching, learning, computers being mean. It must be Friday, the eve of Eighteen, I peeked outside and I think the trees are turning green. But the squirrels, again, they act so weird, smart little kitties worried that everyone disappeared. Speaking of weird, programming is such a fun game, I am convinced it is unhealthy, but I think that's a shame. My computer programs kept me company since I was nine, I was so little, and already learning the command line. Alas, the time doth fly, as we grow older we must take to the sky. We have to learn beyond what is at our fingertips, and set aims for all those leaderships. We should pamper our talents, can't leave them behind, as we grow older they'll play a very important role in our peace of mind. My readers, we are each charged with becoming Teachers, share our knowledge, become Reason's own preachers. The Future is only as bright as Her Humanity, we are Her dignity, Her keepers of sanity. So, search for [video tutorials](http://catpea.com/warrior), maybe open a book, and take a look.",
  "Captain's Log: Day Seventeen of Quarantine. Found two bugs in code, and got stuck in between. I was supposed to be working on a Sound Machine, but spent the noon formatting the code to keep it clean. I can't believe, there is a bug in my code, its probably in octicons, because I am using node. Worst of all, I can't see it fail until I publish, because sapper likes static as not to be sluggish. So here I am, finally dressed up like Superman, Debugging code, blind, like a veritable caveman. I did a bit of soul searching, then followed with some researching. Now, I am sitting here, contemplating if I need a cape, wondering if I should follow up with an Audiotape. I could finish up getting in shape, and completely change the workout landscape. I am serious about making a workout tape, I really want to get in shape. What if the workout required wearing a tail? Would it become like super holy grail? I would walk the street and people would pale, \"Sir! Why have you done this? You, are a Whale!!!\"",
  "Captain's Log: Day Sixteen of Quarantine. Keeping it serious like Wolverine. I have decided not to rhyme, I really haven't got the time. I must leave the thieving Squirrels behind, yes, really, I don't mind. Today, is a new day, I am completely serious, I am going to ignore everything hilarious. I am not even joking, I'll ignore those furriers, I won't even pay attention to their funny scurries. I will sit here quiet, tending to my amazing diet... A stray thought bubbles to my idle mind, Oh, no, I hope people won't go blind! I think I am going to YouTube my workout dance, Now, where the heck did I put my underpants?",
  "Captain's Log: Day Fifteen of Quarantine, Squirrels continue being mean. They just aren't very keen, on the idea, that their theft gave them diarrhea. I know not what to do, Darn Squirrels! that Trailmix was not for you! Maybe someday we'll move on, come a sunny day, carry on. But today, is not that day, it's just Tuesday. This is getting out of control, I don't want to be a poet anymore! I just wanted to feed the creatures I adore. Not write strange rhymes out the front door. I must stop rhyming, this is not the right timing. I feel like I've lost control, spiraling down a Squirrel Hole. I swear I am not like this in real life... I can change!",
  "Captain's Log: Day Fourteen of Quarantine, All the local squirrels, now hold me in high esteem. They feel munchies to extreme, but the trailmix they stole is gone, flurries of the box still scattered on my lawn. Squirrels, now crazed, and withdrawn. Peanuts on their mind, because mail delivery was ill timed. Why am I like this?",
  "Captain's Log: Day Thirteen of Quarantine; still staring at my screen, hanging on for dear life to my spleen as I drink another coffee bean, trying, trying not to create a scene, dancing dressed red outside my window; during quarantine.",
  "The birds are going wild outside my window. Probably because of all the Plump Squirrels I've been feeding. Dammit.",
  "Captain's Log, Day Twelve of Quarantine. I ordered some trailmix from the internet, mailman dropped it off by the door and all the local Squirrels I've been feeding came over, ripped the box open, and ate it. How rude, I probably shoudn't have been feeding them all this time.",
  "Captains Log, Star-date Day Eleven. I connected the Beat Sequencer to Sound. Click on any of the tiny boxes and when the loop comes around the sound will fire. Tip: put a drum every four squares, and something that makes a Tsk every other square. Music is really-really simple, like language, music evolved with us, all it takes is sticks and places to hit them with. Actually we don't even need sticks [Tuvan Singing](https://youtu.be/V76psBrEypg?t=611)",
  "Quarantine Day Ten. My arms grew so powerful from all the rest that I mistakenly struck myself several times. I busied myself today relearning how to handle all my amazing strength. Renamed Hash Bang to [Shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)), as it is the most commonly used variant. Begun working on a beat sequencer, and a song maker. The idea here is that Chords, Bass, Melodies can all be handled by the [Arpeggiator](https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js/wiki/Arpeggiator), but the beat is a bit more complex, and needs a little tool. The tool I have up today uses re-styled checkboxes, a perfect fit for the sequencer.",
  "Captain's Log: Ninth Day of Quarantine: I found one more chicken, am ready for dinner. I created a small [Soundboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundboard_(computer_program)) for what is basically a tiny collection of LOFI Hip-Hop sounds. A tiny collection will do, because we have the the synthesizer taking care of everything else. I added some Hip sounds to the THE WARRIOR Album Single and it does sound very well. Realistically it is difficult to call it music at this point, I have all the components but there were bugs along the way. [Svelte Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/docs#Server-side_rendering) is complicated to visualize, it pre-creates some things, meaning before I publish to the website, Sapper will create a pre-ran version of the site. When a visitor visits, the pre-ran (pre-generated static version) will then be upgraded to a real version, and replaced by now running live version. It is the correct technology, and it didn't get me, but it does take a moment to figure out when a bug jumps out of nowhere.",
  "Captain's Log Supplemental: Day Eight and Half... of Quarantine. I almost finished eating my 30 day supply of Chicken, my muscles have tripled in size, and I have the strength of 300. I begun releasing a New Album entitled **THE WARRIOR** Inspired by [TRON](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Tron+Legacy) and [LOFI Hip-Hop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVxLhy1v-xU).",

  "Captain's Log: Eighth day of the quarantine. I have extended the Sciurine Instrumental Section with a Beautiful Thin Saw (a Sciurine Favorite) and a powerful Electric Cello backing a [Tree Trunk](https://github.com/Tonejs/Presets/blob/gh-pages/instrument/Synth/TreeTrunk.json) Synth. As nothing like this has ever been heard on Planet Earth before, the song has risen all the way to the very top of Shire Lyre Squire Squirrel Choir charts and is expected to stay there permanently, forever.",
  "On the Seventh Day of Quarantine I Added Tremolo ([LFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-frequency_oscillation) effect) to the Sciurines in Memphis song (it is used in the second movement \\[middle of the song\\]), and made our imaginary band a sick medieval logo. All my generative music uses [Scientific Pitch Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_pitch_notation), take that Mozart. It looks like the CPU requirements are too high for mobile devices, small price to pay for a taste of Medieval [Sciurine](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/sciurine) Pop. [Ship it!](https://www.quora.com/On-GitHub-what-is-the-significance-of-the-Ship-It-squirrel?share=1)",
  "Added High Fidelity mode for Dehydration in Memphis, it should be possible to \\[almost\\] play it on mobile now (need a speedy CPU), though it is kind of not the point. The real value in the HD toggle is hearing the actual Synthesizer without any HD filters.",
  "Added membrane synth (Drums) to the Dehydration in Memphis Generative Album (It sounds like the [T-800](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_(character)) is collaborating with the [Sciurine Poor-Fellows](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2050), and he's good.)",
  "Day Six of Quarantine: Created a New Autogenerative Music Widget and disguised it as an immature [Sciurine](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/sciurine) Urine joke. The technology is extremely advanced. I am for the first time in forever connecting virtual synthesizers through a [Reverb Convolver](https://tonejs.github.io/docs/13.8.25/Reverb). This reshapes the Synthesized Sounds, the synthesizer waveform, into a more realistic sounding instrument. Reverb just about does it, if Commodore 64 came with a decent reverb it would sound amazing, nothing like chiptunes. I have gotten used to breaking up my Generative Music into movements, and the initial song comes with 24 measures, where evey eight measures I do something interesting with the higher pitched instruments. For the most part I fell like using A Basic [Arpeggiator](https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js/wiki/Arpeggiator) for everything, I am yet to test it with real world sound samples (digital sound recordings as opposed to synthesizer based sounds.)",
