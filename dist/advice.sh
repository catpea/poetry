There is just one little thing to keep in mind,<br> we have to leave all the bad ideas, behind. Exchange of ideas came a long way,<br> but we still need to eliminate foul play. Because not everyone is educated,<br> and without wisdom life gets complicated. Misinformed people are easily swayed,<br> they are often unprepared, and very scared. If we build to remove their fears,<br> they will love us... to tears. The most powerful early-tool is the Audiobook,<br> wisdom delivered in a way that's hard to overlook. It is private, and comes with no shame,<br> it can take a person from poverty to Hall of Fame. And the best type of things to listen to,<br> are memoirs or lectures, that enlarge a world view. We must stop bad education from tearing us apart,<br> we each have to learn, and become smart. This day of Wisdom, and Peace that we yearn,<br> comes closer each day that we learn.

In 1980 some 40 years ago,<br> the two adventurers gave it ago. They set off for Center State,<br> and that became their Longest Date! It all their walking, it never rained,<br> and it never too sunny, neither complained. They waked holding hands together for a hundred miles,<br> their adventure was amazing, nothing but smiles. When they finally arrived at Mount Pleasant,<br> Harold quietly gave Wally her present. It was a little book of foolish rhyme,<br> that Harold wrote over a long stretch of time. They both just happily turned 57,<br> their life together is pure Heaven. Both are super smart, extremely young, and very strong,<br> their sweet love for each other, is lifelong.

When there is no gym, I get up real early, and ride on through, It is magical out there, seeing the world from the other side, people stuck in traffic, and here I ride. I discovered modern architecture of the highway underpass, little woodland parks, endless fields of grass. Five miles out, there lives an angry goose, at seven miles, in deep summer, angry 'squitoes on the loose, Ten miles out, there is a ninety degree turn, and emptiness follows, nothing but deep green fern. Fifteen miles out, a whole new city, two new parks, and the road gets gritty. At twenty miles, the real adventure starts, you better have water, and some street smarts. And if you keep going forward, you'll arrive on a pier at Lake Erie. At first you'll feel pretty weary, until you realize you're 30 miles from your bed, at which point things will get pretty mad. Hope you have trailmix. Cause you're gonna need it. To find you way back. and keep pushing those pedals. It will get dark soon, but upon your return, you'll fall into your comfy bed, with a long, dramatic swoon,",
  "[Listen](audio/poetry-0036.mp3) Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Thirty One, I've been programming all day, but now I am done. I coded colors, design, music, a whole ballad, but now my mind has fixed its aims on a salad. I've been trying to invent one that tastes really nice, one that someone could even eat twice. And I did! as I always do, Just add Strawberry Jam, a dollop or two. No need for dressing, it tastes like a blessing! Just squirt some jam, mix it up and Bam!",
  "[Listen](audio/poetry-0035.mp3) Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Thirty, I've been fixing bugs all day, and I feel dirty. Now, that I fixed them all, I must admit, I had a ball. But, computers are slow, My CPU is slower than a BBQ. I tried to build a rhyming dictionary, but it came out as an 8 megabyte webpage, and nearly erased the internet. In computers, everything is really bad, but this never makes me sad, I am glad. And now, I took a shower, and smell great, my only wish, is that I already ate.",
  "[Listen](audio/poetry-0034.mp3) Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Twenty Nine, I spent the day doing Graphic Design. Making art and poetry is quite fun, though with the aid of computers, easily overdone. I've been doing this for so long, that I've learned, that, on computers, brevity is the Mother of Invention. I am a huge fan, of the UNIX command line, of the various little ways to get things done. Graphic design, takes a different path, it takes a while to switch between the two. Programming languages, is where I spend most of my time, its an in-between world, betwixt the two. I've been programming Music and Art, It turned out not to be that hard. At the end of the day, what matters is the Masterpiece, it matters not if it comes from Computers, Music or Art, So as long as you finish what you start, and use your hart, you are an Artist, and what you make, is Art.",
  "[Listen](audio/poetry-0033.mp3) Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Twenty Eight, It's evening and it's late, Time for another poetic update, I sit here, and yet again, cogitate. It actually feels pretty great, I look forward to my little poetry date. And I always try to really concentrate, turn everything off and meditate. Let all those rhymes percolate. Let all those words decorate. Poetry is a universe in self, it won't always let you write what you are trying say. I just want to rhyme something funny, write about weather or how its sunny. But each poem has a mind of its own, each one is a kind of a milestone. There is a thousand ways to get to the end, but it all depends if the message is, what you intend.",
  "[Listen](audio/poetry-0032.mp3) Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Twenty Seven, Ohh, I waited to write until eleven. It seems late at night, but this is when my rhymes take flight. I admit, I am ready for bed, but I am just going to sit here, instead, and wait for my poem to go ahead. Nuh uhh, rhyming is not always easy, sometimes you just got to to wait, and take it easy. Wait for the prime rhyme, to top of your mind... climb. And then finally, when you get there, you sit, read, and stare, feeling like the poem, is a little bare. But what can you do? It's late at night, and you are not really feeling very bright. But you still have to write, so that's quite all right. This is how I begin my night, I write.",
  "[Listen](audio/poetry-0031.mp3) Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Twenty Six, I eat with metal chopsticks. I stopped using forks, to munch my porks. I don't even know how long ago it was, so long ago, I forgot the cause. I own two metal chopsticks, and they work as good as fingers. I use them to eat my salads, to scoop out Jelly and Peanut Butter, I kid you not, I even use them as a little cutter. A dull stick is just fine to turn a sausage in two. And of course, I stir many a tea, or protein brew. I do not miss the dangerous forks, though once, in a blue moon, I wish, I owned a spoon.",
  "[Listen](audio/poetry-0030.mp3) Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Twenty Five, Yesterday, Bernie dropped out. I didn't even try to wait, you can't place this much weight. And what were we expecting? It has always been like this, hit and miss. It is time for all, to rise. Become a Citizen of The World. In your own hands. With your own mind. Seek Knowledge and Triumph. Let the name of this New Nation be, Earth, May the Citizen be called, a Human. The power is in your hands, so near, rooted in every audio-book you can hear. And you have to lean to rise, you can't near the skies, without your eyes! When you have learned enough, you have to turn around and teach. Yell from your mountain, scream, dance and preach. The promise of Freedom, Reason, and Peace, is in our hands, it is our Masterpiece. Education is [fun](http://catpea.com/warrior) it only ever seems hard, because one is trying to learn too much in too little time. The only way we can fully learn, is by inheriting knowledge from World's most beloved Heroes. This inheritance begins by following in their footstep, first; and continues, when we break away to resume where they left off. Rise, rise to the mountains before you. The only way, is to go up, to grow up, to grow all the way up, until we each become a Great Being. Same as those before us, same as those that are sure to rise. Open Your Eyes. The Time is Always Now.",

I am dressed, I am wearing my favorite workout clothes, I stretched left and right, and fluffed up my pillows. For tonight, I prepared, a Bill Bryson Auidobook I adore, Even though I am already so sleepy that I could snore. I will listen about the [History of the World](https://www.audible.com/pd/A-Short-History-of-Nearly-Everything-Audiobook/B002V0KFPW), about all the mysterious things and places we explored. This is how I go to sleep every night, the book will slowly play... until daylight. I learned so much from online lectures and audio books, that these days, I can focus on my good looks.

And I keep Programming late into the night, typing like a Lion with all his might. This morn, I woke up and made Peanut Butter and Jelly, I've been programming all day, I keep going like the telly. Now, I am trying to figure out, a datatype for verse, my stanza CSS padding and margins are intense.

  "Captain's Log: Quarantine. Day Twenty One. There is birdsong outside, and I can feel the sun. I woke up rested, for the first time, in years. My mind was hardly ever tired, but all the rest needed time. I am ready for gyms to reopen, It will be so much fun. I will dance even faster, workout longer. My diet is twice as good as it was before, including soup, and proper portion control. It took twenty one days, for my body to begin recovering from my workouts. What a great sadness it would be, to wish now, that I should have danced, or tried harder. Instead, here I am. Bouncy, and perky as heck, Ready to go back. Use your days wisely, let no day slip away. Live, make each day count, it all adds together, balance your account. What makes us great, is the sum of all the days in the past. What makes us strong, is making each day better than the one before. Make each day count, enlarge your world.",
  "Captain's Log: Quarantine. Day Twenty, the promised day of rhyme a plenty. I am sitting here with my salad, expecting to write world's littlest ballad. I waited until the conclusion of day, to see with what rhymes that may pay. Alas, twenty just about rhymes with plenty, it rhymes as good as yeti and orange. On the other hand Twenty One, rhymes with all under the sun. I am sitting here smacking my lips, Counting down 90 days to Penumbral Eclipse. I made little sausages to add to my salad, I added really spicy dressing to spruce up my ballad. ![A](image/poetry-0025-a.jpg) My Little Fort (note orange tent in the center) As I grilled the little things, I remembered that same smell, it was back when I lived in the ancient dune wilderness. ![X](image/poetry-0025-x.jpg) Little Sausage Dinner That memory really rings a bell, It was at the height of my loneliness. ![B](image/poetry-0025-b.jpg) My Evening Couch, as I waited for Lake Michigan Sunsets Deep woods, ancient dunes, and warm and sunny afternoons. ![K](image/poetry-0025-k.jpg) Deep in Woods Not all afternoons were sunny, I once got a heck of a reminder, One cold afternoon I remembered that I get scared of thunder. ![C](image/poetry-0025-c.jpg) And My Evening Wear Not, little thunder of course, the scary ones, that always strike with great force. ![T](image/poetry-0025-t.jpg) Dark Evening It was almost never scary, certainly never scary for long, it would pass, and moon or sun would rise, followed by birdsong. ![H](image/poetry-0025-h.jpg) People taking photos of my Horses I remember by the beach many stood, as I built horses out of driftwood, ![I](image/poetry-0025-i.jpg) Horse 2.0 ![J](image/poetry-0025-j.jpg) Horse 3.0 The height of my loneliness, also came with a great deal of silliness, ![L](image/poetry-0025-l.jpg) Beach House ![M](image/poetry-0025-m.jpg) Beach House I waived to the future, and to today, Look at me, I am a Cowboy!

  "Captain's Log: Day Nineteen of Quarantine. Tomorrow, day twenty may have rhyme a plenty, but it won't rhyme with quarantine, and that was unforeseen. I waited all day to write, to see if something interesting may bite. I wanted to draw and paint, and dance and prance, but ended up discovering a new [poem about taking chance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6_QUhUPrF4). I ended up programming, music and art, I aimed to do something relaxing, but smart. Such are meow days, and had been forever and more, searching for all things special and all the things I adore. Now, I am finishing today's poem, one foot already in bed, Though I already had my salad, I wonder if I should make some bread. That's sounds about right, I'll waddle downstairs and grab a bite. Goodnight.",
  "Captain's Log: Day Eighteen of Quarantine. Researching, learning, computers being mean. It must be Friday, the eve of Eighteen, I peeked outside and I think the trees are turning green. But the squirrels, again, they act so weird, smart little kitties worried that everyone disappeared. Speaking of weird, programming is such a fun game, I am convinced it is unhealthy, but I think that's a shame. My computer programs kept me company since I was nine, I was so little, and already learning the command line. Alas, the time doth fly, as we grow older we must take to the sky. We have to learn beyond what is at our fingertips, and set aims for all those leaderships. We should pamper our talents, can't leave them behind, as we grow older they'll play a very important role in our peace of mind. My readers, we are each charged with becoming Teachers, share our knowledge, become Reason's own preachers. The Future is only as bright as Her Humanity, we are Her dignity, Her keepers of sanity. So, search for [video tutorials](http://catpea.com/warrior), maybe open a book, and take a look.",
  "Captain's Log: Day Seventeen of Quarantine. Found two bugs in code, and got stuck in between. I was supposed to be working on a Sound Machine, but spent the noon formatting the code to keep it clean. I can't believe, there is a bug in my code, its probably in octicons, because I am using node. Worst of all, I can't see it fail until I publish, because sapper likes static as not to be sluggish. So here I am, finally dressed up like Superman, Debugging code, blind, like a veritable caveman. I did a bit of soul searching, then followed with some researching. Now, I am sitting here, contemplating if I need a cape, wondering if I should follow up with an Audiotape. I could finish up getting in shape, and completely change the workout landscape. I am serious about making a workout tape, I really want to get in shape. What if the workout required wearing a tail? Would it become like super holy grail? I would walk the street and people would pale, \"Sir! Why have you done this? You, are a Whale!!!\"",
  "Captain's Log: Day Sixteen of Quarantine. Keeping it serious like Wolverine. I have decided not to rhyme, I really haven't got the time. I must leave the thieving Squirrels behind, yes, really, I don't mind. Today, is a new day, I am completely serious, I am going to ignore everything hilarious. I am not even joking, I'll ignore those furriers, I won't even pay attention to their funny scurries. I will sit here quiet, tending to my amazing diet... A stray thought bubbles to my idle mind, Oh, no, I hope people won't go blind! I think I am going to YouTube my workout dance, Now, where the heck did I put my underpants?",
  "Captain's Log: Day Fifteen of Quarantine, Squirrels continue being mean. They just aren't very keen, on the idea, that their theft gave them diarrhea. I know not what to do, Darn Squirrels! that Trailmix was not for you! Maybe someday we'll move on, come a sunny day, carry on. But today, is not that day, it's just Tuesday. This is getting out of control, I don't want to be a poet anymore! I just wanted to feed the creatures I adore. Not write strange rhymes out the front door. I must stop rhyming, this is not the right timing. I feel like I've lost control, spiraling down a Squirrel Hole. I swear I am not like this in real life... I can change!",
  "Captain's Log: Day Fourteen of Quarantine, All the local squirrels, now hold me in high esteem. They feel munchies to extreme, but the trailmix they stole is gone, flurries of the box still scattered on my lawn. Squirrels, now crazed, and withdrawn. Peanuts on their mind, because mail delivery was ill timed. Why am I like this?",
  "Captain's Log: Day Thirteen of Quarantine; still staring at my screen, hanging on for dear life to my spleen as I drink another coffee bean, trying, trying not to create a scene, dancing dressed red outside my window; during quarantine.",
  "The birds are going wild outside my window. Probably because of all the Plump Squirrels I've been feeding. Dammit.",
  "Captain's Log, Day Twelve of Quarantine. I ordered some trailmix from the internet, mailman dropped it off by the door and all the local Squirrels I've been feeding came over, ripped the box open, and ate it. How rude, I probably shoudn't have been feeding them all this time.",
  "Captains Log, Star-date Day Eleven. I connected the Beat Sequencer to Sound. Click on any of the tiny boxes and when the loop comes around the sound will fire. Tip: put a drum every four squares, and something that makes a Tsk every other square. Music is really-really simple, like language, music evolved with us, all it takes is sticks and places to hit them with. Actually we don't even need sticks [Tuvan Singing](https://youtu.be/V76psBrEypg?t=611)",
  "Quarantine Day Ten. My arms grew so powerful from all the rest that I mistakenly struck myself several times. I busied myself today relearning how to handle all my amazing strength. Renamed Hash Bang to [Shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)), as it is the most commonly used variant. Begun working on a beat sequencer, and a song maker. The idea here is that Chords, Bass, Melodies can all be handled by the [Arpeggiator](https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js/wiki/Arpeggiator), but the beat is a bit more complex, and needs a little tool. The tool I have up today uses re-styled checkboxes, a perfect fit for the sequencer.",
  "Captain's Log: Ninth Day of Quarantine: I found one more chicken, am ready for dinner. I created a small [Soundboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundboard_(computer_program)) for what is basically a tiny collection of LOFI Hip-Hop sounds. A tiny collection will do, because we have the the synthesizer taking care of everything else. I added some Hip sounds to the THE WARRIOR Album Single and it does sound very well. Realistically it is difficult to call it music at this point, I have all the components but there were bugs along the way. [Svelte Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/docs#Server-side_rendering) is complicated to visualize, it pre-creates some things, meaning before I publish to the website, Sapper will create a pre-ran version of the site. When a visitor visits, the pre-ran (pre-generated static version) will then be upgraded to a real version, and replaced by now running live version. It is the correct technology, and it didn't get me, but it does take a moment to figure out when a bug jumps out of nowhere.",

  "On the Seventh Day of Quarantine I Added Tremolo ([LFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-frequency_oscillation) effect) to the Sciurines in Memphis song (it is used in the second movement \\[middle of the song\\]), and made our imaginary band a sick medieval logo. All my generative music uses [Scientific Pitch Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_pitch_notation), take that Mozart. It looks like the CPU requirements are too high for mobile devices, small price to pay for a taste of Medieval [Sciurine](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/sciurine) Pop.

  "Day Six of Quarantine: Created a New Autogenerative Music Widget and disguised it as an immature [Sciurine](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/sciurine) Urine joke. The technology is extremely advanced. I am for the first time in forever connecting virtual synthesizers through a [Reverb Convolver](https://tonejs.github.io/docs/13.8.25/Reverb). This reshapes the Synthesized Sounds, the synthesizer waveform, into a more realistic sounding instrument. Reverb just about does it, if Commodore 64 came with a decent reverb it would sound amazing, nothing like chiptunes. I have gotten used to breaking up my Generative Music into movements, and the initial song comes with 24 measures, where evey eight measures I do something interesting with the higher pitched instruments. For the most part I fell like using A Basic [Arpeggiator](https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js/wiki/Arpeggiator) for everything, I am yet to test it with real world sound samples (digital sound recordings as opposed to synthesizer based sounds.)",
