Evenings At Nordhouse: Adventures At The Edge Of The Universe

We are each a unique creature,
so what I felt won't be what you will feel when you are there.

But there are some things
that may be similar.

There are more than 218 moons in our solar system,
each one is an edge, just like the beach at Nordhouse is an edge.

It is really,
just about the same place, gravity doesn't matter much since you are elated anyway.

You are royalty,
out on your very own Moon.

It is important that you have paper an pen,
make sure your notes resist getting wet, test it, things can get wet out there.

The journal, is for a single compound sentence type things,
it is good to write it down.

Though you can't possibly forget it,
but if you did, the thought would come back to you.

The journal is so that you can scribble a big thought,
and move on to the bigger one.

Some example observations maybe...

"Schools are not teaching, tests aren't testing knowledge,
diplomas are bunk, colleges are a business, and the whole thing is a scam."

"Uneducated voters are easily swayed by all the things that uneducated,
have always showed to be passionate about, racism, nationalism, hate, and us vs. them logic."

"Military targets young boys, because it is easy, because they are easily impressed,
they don't know enough about the world nor will they know war until it is too late;
fathers are sending their children to kill each other in wars about thing that they ruined."

"The Thirteenth Amendment of United States, may force those who participate in Jury Duty,
into participating in slavery, as a slaver."

"Criminal who are fractured by the bony hands of poverty,
are not themselves, they are they are victimized by poverty and the denial of even the most basic human rights."

"The unforgivable by the desperate act of bankruptcy, College Debt,
alters the meaning of money, a meaning already eroded by the worst of human ideas,
unforgivable debt makes what is owed void, and invalid, it is just a sick version of money that isn't real."

"Government paying colleges for student debt, to save the students from it, is a temporary fix;
asking why colleges charge so much money, is not even the right question,
"Do colleges teach?", is the correct question."

"Poverty and Lack of Education, has brought progress down to a stop,
countries that fought for freedom with great vision,
are falling back down for lack of it,
that vision can only be found in real education, in real wisdom that opens gateways to greatness."

---

These observations never end... some of them are a little crooked,
you may not have a full picture.

But once you make the observation,
you will become sensitive to all the subjects that stand in support of it.

You won't make wrong observations,
just ones that need more information.

If there is something that is really calling to you,
like Philosophy called to me.

Then just get 15 audio books about it,
sometimes books that don't come out well as audio books, are just not that good.

Audio books,
may just mark the elite of books worth investing time it,

Einstein said,
"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."

So if a book doesn't explain something valuable and magnificent, simply,
it probably relates to another quote which goes:

"There's a sucker born every minute"

So just keep an eye out for the fake charts,
designed to sell garbage meant to pray on uneducated readers...
