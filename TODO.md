Gnothi Seauton: An Old Kind Of School

School, wisdom, philosophy, job, university, career, writing, politics, adventure, grades, greatness, soul,

how can you tell which of these are real, outdated or just not worth your time?

By finding your beginning, of course,

and then weaving an unbroken thread that makes you rise.

We are born of chaos and accident, but we are a masterpiece of the Universe,

the time required to permute all combinations of chemicals to give rise to life is, long.

We are here, because as unlikely as life is,

eventually, given enough time, and space, it emerges out of mere chaos and accident.

When you look around this planet,

despite lateral gene transfer, unstoppable power of selection, we are the only branch that can reach wisdom.

I think it is safe to say that some animals love and care, maybe admire,

but unfortunately try as they might Chimpanzees, Dolphins and Elephants can't build cities of thoughts and dreams.

In a word, we, the emergent intelligent creatures, are:

rare.

In two words:

Beautiful and Rare.

We have to examine what sets us apart from Chimpanzees ad Dolphins,

and see what we can weave with it.

In the misery of cold caves,

or the torture or concentration camps imagining gods goes a long way.

In the dark ages of child labor,

or the sickness of slavery and inequality school goes a long way.

In the age of Mustard Gas,

or poverty and disease and hungry rats, a national border goes far.

In the age of Mutually Assured Destruction,

Cold War and Global Threats, a University education can be useful.

But in the age of Internet, we enter a new era,

where what imaginary gods, simple schools, crazy borders, and trendy universities bring us, is actually, unimpressive and clunky.

We grew,

my friends, it happened just now, just like that.

A new way of learning:

Audio Books on The Trail.

(SEE https://catpea.com FOR FULL VERSION, YouTube has a 5,000 word limit.)

After a few years,

what you have weaved out of your books, will be unbreakable, and so unique as to extend precisely who yo are, far into, who you must become to reach greatness.

A day will come, when you will notice the struggle of authors to rise higher,

and in sadness discover that you will find fewer and fewer books that move you, eventually where your last book ends.

Your own book,

will start.

And you will add to the mountain peak you climbed,

and others will follow, and your book will become their last book, and so on.

That's how you will know what is real,

what is fake, by taking every important step to the highest of heights and leaving your Soul behind for others to resurrect it when your book comes up.

Worry not, countless others have traveled these roads,

wisdom is real, it is meaningful, it changes you and others for better, and your book will be irreplaceable and beloved by many.

And, no, it is foolish to think that you must become an author to write a book, there are too many of those books already,

you only need to become wise to write, there are no critics here, as you cry, the reader will cry, as you climb the next mountain, the reader will triumph with you.

Take your self-education to the trails,

the nature will help you slow down and connect with the spirits of the authors stored within the books.

Don't worry, it will be OK,

so as long as all your steps count as a triumph, your growing up will become an upward slope, and your life will eventually become as beautiful as you.

And the last thing a Great Being discovers,

is the answer to their first big question "Who am I?", it will all lay open as you look back from your golden age.

Your path to wisdom intertwined with adventure and great discoveries,

and bears, and dunes, and Fox Fire, and rain and snow, and softness of moss, and endless seas of fern, open like all the great ideas behind all the most beloved of poems.
