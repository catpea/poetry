Heroic Courage: A Human Being Is To Grow All The Way Up

Yes, there are no guarantees that our works will stand the test of time,
but this no reason to hide, or to take it easy.
Moments of life are extremely precious,
and you must live Courageously.
To advance forward as a courageous person,
is far more meaningful than quietly hiding.
To live courageously means become wise,
it is not a random thing, it is your decision making, your life.
This is why being Authentic, and Clear,
is so important, it helps you see your future.
It helps you wisely reason about your Contributions and Legacy,
and see yourself in time.
And Heroic Courage is two fold,
as Bren√© Brown explains.
You can't be a Hero to others,
until you become a hero to your self.
Courage is about using wisdom to rise and rise,
to become wiser and wiser to no end.
It is hard to see the importance of it all,
because wisdom, is what you use to look at yourself.
We can be certain that we are all extremely intelligent,
and that knowledge and wisdom is a much needed fuel that helps us grow.
And we can be certain, that to grow up does not mean become taller or older, BUT WISER,
and that there is no end to growing up, you simply grow: All The Way Up.
