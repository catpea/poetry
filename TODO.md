Meant For Greatness

It is not enough to be successful in this or that,
it _really_ matters what you are successful at.

If you listened to someone who pushed you off your path,
if you listened because you were scared of their wrath.

If you did what you were told,
and now you are thinking you are too old.

You _have to_ use whatever wisdom you now hold,
to break out! of your mould.

(slow)

It is never too late,
for your mind, to become great.

You were never supposed to be,
the best employee.

I guess, you were never told,
that you were meant to _help the world_.

You thought you were too small,
maybe there was some kind of a wall.

But that was just an illusion,
because your growing up was never meant to come to a conclusion.

You were meant to grow to no end,
your first challenge was to comprehend.

You are meant to see,
you are meant to grow free.

(medium)

See, you can't just go with the flow,
because we must each help the world grow.

There are too many problems that we all face,
from climate change to the next arms race.

We need to rise,
we need to come together to stand up against all the lies.

---

Please, become a great-being-now,
it is up to you to figure out how.

The world needs all the wisdom and understanding,
it never stands still, it is ever expanding.

We need real teachers not fake schools,
the younger generations must not be used as tools.

---

Please understand, you are not a worker, or an office employee,
your mind is meant to grow to no end, it is meant to be free.

Leave behind all the office stress,
and take to books to inherit all their greatness,

You are meant to begin where the Great Beings retired,
your mind is to be celebrated and admired.

---

Life will not be simpler this way,
but it will grow more profound each day.

Do not let your days merge into one,
we are meant for greatness, and our work won't ever done.
