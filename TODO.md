Learning To Learn

Learning is like climbing a mountain,
there are no shortcuts, and you have to go step by step.
And it is also like putting a computer together,
or wiring a home entertainment center, you can't leave something out.
It is also like learning just a little bit about ice skating,
you really need to carefully step on that ice and see what it feels like.
Learning for real, is the same as having fun,
being fascinated about what you are doing, enjoying it.
Finally, learning for real is also about long term achievement,
like section hiking the Appalachian Trail over many decades...
...and then arriving at Mount Katahdin, come your golden age;
it is about making a difference, and becoming better for it, adding to greater whole.
When we go to school, and we end up thinking,
if I jump through these hoops I will graduate and then I'll figure the next step.
The strong sequence, the integrated whole, becomes a wet rag,
the aim becomes a carrot on a stick, things become unclear, but we keep going.
It is OK to make this mistake,
so as long as we learn from it.
So as long as we learn,
and prevent others from being taken advantage of the same way.
Begin asking questions about education,
don't just sit there memorizing disconnected facts, demand a real education.
We all have computers now,
we should all learn about programming.
We need to know that a function takes an input,
transforms it, often by calling other functions, and return an output, output = function(input);
We need to know what a loop is,
that it often processes a list of items, one at a time, calling functions with the item as input.
For example, for every user in a list,
if membership expires soon on this user, then send warning message for this user.
Programming, is so simple,
that it only takes a few days to learn.
You have to do it right,
that is what schools were meant to help us with.
For example, YOU NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER, start by just creating a file,
and then configuring things, NO, you start with a boilerplate.
Only later, when you have time to waste,
you go and read the darn manual or guide.
I am actually serious about this,
the manual will never tell you what the most important parts are relative to your use case.
If you just need a window with a blank canvas,
for a little 50 line wiki that helps you study, you don't need to worry about drop downs, or icon sizes.
You will return many times to the things that are useful,
and with each use case, you will learn a new way of using the program, that is far more than any documentation can explain.
Another huge deal, is the language you start with,
I know many programming languages but I don't use them, some are too old, but in most cases they just do things badly and are too small.
The language you choose must be the one getting the most stress, attention, and hate,
because to hate a language is to admit to have learned the wrong one.
Today that language is ES2021,
it is the evolution of JavaScript, the language behind all the web applications, that also runs on the server via node.js.
There are some strong side languages that are worth considering venturing into,
but just bookmark them and forget it.
You need to learn language that will help you create cute little command line programs, mighty web apps,
quick and dirty web servers that never complain under real stress, and desktop applications, including powerful code editors.
Above all, it all needs to be cross platform,
so that you never have to worry about rewriting your program for a different operating system.
To learn something, we need really competent teachers,
who learned what they know not from textbooks, but from experience.
If it is not possible to have good teachers,
then it is more important to lean on your own first, and then go to school to get the diploma.
If the school isn't teaching then you are not going to learn anything,
you are only going to learn something that isn't even all that useful.

In school we get stressed out about passing the exams,
or trying to graduate in half the time to save money, and that is no way to learn.
That is not how a Student should be treated,
a Student represents the future of humanity, they should be treated with great dignity and respect.
I think time has come to view schools that charge for education, and companies that require a diploma,
as institutions that have little talent, will eventually either lose credibility, or just go out of business.
What does a company that demands a diploma say,
about its stability and your retirement plan, what does it say about the talent that you will encounter there.
Will your co-workers be passionate about making cute little file saving discoveries,
or is it all going to be about profit maximization and promotions.
Once you retire,
the real work starts.
You now enter an age where you are experienced enough to make lasting contributions,
to leave an inspired and meaningful legacy.
And at this stage in your life,
having learned for real, becomes even more important, as you rely on it, to become a Great Being.
