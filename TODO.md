Job Interview Tips: They won't ask you questions that have answers.
2021-03-15T00:42:59.777Z
Audio Version
So everything you memorized,
goes straight out the window.
You will be thrown against questions without answers,
and judged based on the methods you use to eventually fail.
It is the quality of your thinking,
not the solution of the problem that gets you the position.
Supply and demand, money...
you've been made to memorize answers to trick puzzles since high school.
The entrance exams,
are little more than crossword puzzles.
And the whole educational experience between middle school and university, inclusive,
is about people making money off of you.
For the same reason why military does not recruit middle aged men,
why the only go after the ones that didn't have a chance to become wise yet.
Businesses grow in places where there is money,
and there is money in selling promises of futures.
And this is not a secret,
especially when it comes to real jobs.
Not jobs that will train you,
but ones that expect you to lead as an innovator.
So the interview process, is not about how many solutions to entrance exam puzzles you memorized,
but about the puzzles that do not come with solutions, at all.
I know what you are thinking,
you are not smart enough to lead, and try to solve those problems.

Ask them how much of you do they expect you to give,
and how much is your pay in proportion to the CEO.
And how long do they expect yo to work there,
and how much do they think years of your life are really worth.
I recommend you ask that same question,
at every interview...
and learn to no end,
how your job is not that different from the minimal almost fake education that took your savings.
The answer to the original question that brought you here,
was not College and Career.
It was Self Education,
and Entrepreneurship.
You took the road more traveled,
the first stretch took your money, and the second will take your decades so you can pay off the debt.
And you better have huge debt,
because if you don't, then you don't even have a reason to go in to the interview.
Either way,
this is not the way.
Every year of your life,
is infinitely more valuable, than anything you will find, working for somebody else.
So stop it,
stop now before it is too late.
You are meant to learn for real,
you are mean to be truly knowledgeable, far beyond anything that can be asked at an interview.
No matter their zest for genius,
they wouldn't come up with a question to capture one, their very position and approach is proof they wouldn't know what one looks like.
As you can no doubt tell,
a lot behind those questions is there so that they can impress themselves.
But enough about that stupid interview,
that is not the way, that is not your way.
You have been misled by education and the promise of a safe job,
today all of this still just about moneymaking.
You have been spread thin,
you must pull yourself back together.
You have to go back and restore the predispositions that schools stripped yo off,
in their haste to sell your mind for a paycheck, and later for your tuition.
Your unique predispositions are the only key to your future,
you may think to yourself that you only had one, and it was ridiculously child like.
Yes, that is what a predisposition for greatness emerges as initially,
a childhood curiosity.
And then as you tend to it it will fork and grow like a large corona,
you will enter stages of Art and Music, Uniqueness and Creativity, you will zoom right past being a Genius and a Polymath, and learn things worth a thousand times more.
So many things, that those asking those interview questions will look infantile,
it will feel like a bunch of actors trying to make themselves look bigger either by caring to much r pretending to care too little.
Enough is enough,
and no, it won't work temporary.
You need those years to grow,
not to rent them out to bigger than thou ding-dongs.
Finally, I am canceling your interview tomorrow,
because it is a waste of your time.
Instead you are going shopping to prepare for an expedition,
find the longest Adventure Trail wherever you live, Appalachian, Pacific Crest, whatever, and pack.
Get a Journal and a waterproof marker,
and discover the polymath in you.
When you return,
build a series of small companies until you learn how to do it right.
And never again follow,
and never again let someone tell you who you are, or smart you are, or where you need to be, or how much you are worth to them.
Be mindful of your legacy,
and of those who are being misguided right now, help them learn, prevent them from making the same mistakes you did.
The world stands still, today, the politics are frozen, even the police kills those who they are sworn to protect,
the World can only grow when you and countless others unleash the Genius, the Polymath, and the Greatness, within.
No interview,
you are meant to become a great being.
The World needs you to lead,
no more dumb interviews there isn't a company noble enough, there isn't a company worthy of your time.
This is not the kind of a world,
each generation must progress forward, what you see before you is not fixed, it is just an imperfect stepping stone froward.
Stop letting others search for you,
and set of on an endless adventure to discover the great being within.
