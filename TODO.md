Above all, begin paying attention to your mental well being,
whatever is causing you harm, get away from it.

If you think you can't get away from it,
then find a relative that will take you in.

If you don't have relatives,
then you will have to talk to your best friend's parents.

You can't stay in a place that is stressing you out,
you need a place that is safe, a place where you can think.

---

And then begin thinking about building a company,
or a tiny business, at first just for learning.

---

Everyone says it is not easy,
people say they get burned out, overworked.

But that is the wrong approach,
you need to be whole.

---

There is a little passage in the Ranger Creed,
that nobly emphasizes just that.

---

"Never shall I fail my comrades. I will always keep myself mentally alert, physically strong and morally straight and I will shoulder more than my share of the task whatever it may be, one-hundred-percent and then some.

---

Mentally alert means, you take care of your mind,
that you are rested, that you are free.

---

Do not let mediocrity, liars, cheaters, pretenders hurt your mind,
you have to be mentally alert, mentally well enough to easily go above and beyond.

Mental Well Being, is Number One,
number two, is somewhat related, especially if you are in middle school or high school.

The first thing you need is an upgrade on you view of the world,
the way you inherit a more sophisticated intellectual culture is Audio Books.

They are not free,
they should be free for people under 21.

There is no one book, it will take over a hundred Audio Books,
- and you know this, this one is not easy.

With a hundred books, you will create a self-balancing view of the world,
and in the process inherit character traits from many of your favorite authors.

Intellectual Inheritance,
is just another way of saying growing up by reading books.

This is one of the reasons why you need a safe place, a safe space,
so that you may grow up, uninterrupted by things that are not worthy of you.

---

There is one sure way to accelerate your intellectual growth,
but you need three more friends, at least, and you need to be in your 20s or up.

An that is taking to the trails,
don't do this alone, please.

In United States we have The Appalachian Trail,
and The Pacific Crest Trail.

Bring your Audiobooks, Bear Spray, and an Air Horn (bears don't like loud sounds),
especially if it is four horns going off at the same time.

Ignore people that say you don't need the horn,
just activate it until they walk away.

Bring your journal,
and grow.
