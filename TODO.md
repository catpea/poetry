Forever Summer

As winter nears,
and snow appears.

You need not worry,
it is not end of Summers's glory.

Simply, look at weather, in Florida Keys,
no doubt it will be 83 or more degrees.

Often Georgia is also very nice,
and it is not too far, and may suffice.

Don't let snow make you fell lonely or sad,
because things aren't that bad.

Plus.

There is a couple more reasons,
for one, the equator reverses seasons.

And two, there are people that walk from Georgia to Maine,
from early Spring to Autumn they hardly ever complain.

Those are the Appalacian Trail Hikers of course,
beautiful, powerful, and as strong as many a horse.

From Springer Mountain to Mount Katahdin they walk,
crossing every mountain, valley, woodland, and rock.

---

So if Winter ever makes you feel sad,
then it is time for change, and you should be glad.

Because, wintry sadness is a universal call,
a call for adventure, that rings in us all.

Whether you are only going to drive to Georgia and back,
go all the way to the Keys, or start shopping for a backpack.

Growing up is something that people who love you, want you to do,
they know that to thine own self, you must be true.

Our lives are precious and we are not workers of any kind,
we are dreamers and thinkers and we are not meant to live blind.

You are at your most beautiful when you are Happy and Strong,
grab your loved ones and have them come along.
