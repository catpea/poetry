No Ordinary Lives

We are not meant to live ordinary lives,
ordinary lives merely take from us and give it away.

You have to breathe,
like a song.

You aren't even an ordinary person,
what is it about you that is so standard?

---

How are you, like everybody else,
when you are so unique that there is no way to replace you.

We are creatures born of chaos and star dust,
we are driven by infinite complexity.

---

You represent inexhaustible power,
and you are born into a fantasia of artists looking for your crumbs.

If a teacher is not teaching, or if a parent is indifferent,
or if you are asked to lay down your life for a belief that only lines the pockets of whoever is asking.

Walk, away,
you are ahead and above of meaningless nonsense.

---

You are a Citizen of The World,
and you are to care about your Body and Mind.

You have to work towards excellence in areas of Knowledge, Wisdom, and Greatness,
and not let it drip away, or become exhausted spark by irreplaceable spark.

---

More than a citizen of the world,
you are also a nearly impossible miracle of the Universe.

A human is not the kind of a creature
that should accept some common notion of life and its meaning.

We are creators, explores, adventurers and thinkers,
each life is to be unique, it cannot be a copy of any other.

You are a royalty,
and knowledge will help you to understanding, vision, wisdom and greatness.

Find wisdom, before making decision that affect the rest of your life,
set of on beautiful adventures, make friends with authors and their books.

Just listen to the narrator,
we learn best from great story tellers, it has always been like this.

It is hard to understand the importance of a life changing book,
before you actually find it, before it moves you.

But you have to,
you have to search for books that will change your life for better.

Books help us jump decades ahead of ourselves,
we are meant to inherit hard won wisdom.

So that we need not start from the beginning,
so that wee to can contribute to Humanity's body of knowledge.

May wisdom guide you,
may you start at the greatest of heights.

And in turn may you,
become an inspiration and a bringer of light.
