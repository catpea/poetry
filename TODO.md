Very gently we must step out of comfort zone,
and find something our elder selves may wish to have known.

We learn beast out of curiosity and in need,
and to so start we need a direction and a seed.

A direction is set by something cool,
and the seed is something trying to put you back in school.

That's when you know you have something fun,
something that will challenge you until you are done.

A challenge is a wonderful quest,
something that will keep you learning until you do your best.

Please, stop walking the same road,
take your leap of curiosity; learn to paint, or dance, or code.
