What In The Equinox?

I knew today was special somehow,
so I got out of my bed with a high brow.
Still a little woozy from a good night's sleep,
I skipped over to my computers in a single leap.
I turned on Bach's famous Prélude from the Cello Suite No. 1,
with Yo-Yo Ma performing it was a lot of fun.
At 1:51 in the video the Prélude began speaking about drums to me,
it calls to a drum and some sticks from a tree.
I closed my eyes and muttered "How curious",
I hope this won't make Bach furious...
Because I can rebuild hos song,
and it won't even take very long.
I left that project for another day,
but as learning goes, rebuilding songs is the way.
My computer popped up an update,
one I had to install meow, it couldn't wait.
And then I squeaked, Holly molly batman,
the Raspberry PI has an option to control the fan.
I moved the wires on the GPIO header,
and the fan started working a lot better.
Now the fan only turns on when it hits 70C,
my Raspberry PI is now as quiet as me.
Then I pondered the old computers some more,
how simple the commands were in the days of yore.
At 6:02 of AT&T Archives: The UNIX Operating System Brian Kernighan of the UNIX and K&R fame,
describes the original aim.
And I thought to myself, we all understand,
we just need to set our foot in the computer land.
We just need an inexpensive Unix or Linux machine,
with a nice and wide screen.
I pondered Node.js too,
node streams flow just like UNIX commands do.
And finally I put my shoes on as not to spend the whole day here,
and bought another bag of ghost pepper chips, they burned from my nose to the ear.
Days like this may seem uneventful,
but this is what we end up withing for when life becomes a handful.
This was a magical Equinox and a spicy Equinox Eve,
this is what they mean when people say appreciate the little things - I believe.
And somehow all my neighborhood conspired to to fire up their fireplaces one last time,
the air smells so good it is hard to rhyme.
There is no doubt that we are all genius level smart,
and lives must be lived as if they were precious works of art.
Do not let troublemakers, schools, or work get in your way,
we should treat each day, as if it was a special holiday.
