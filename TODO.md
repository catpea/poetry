The Noble Quest Against Falsehoods

Falsehoods,
are mind killers.

Falsehoods limit us, they divide us,
they poison Humanity.

People who believe in falsehoods,
are prevented from growing up.

---

As scary as that is,
we also have everything it takes to remove them from our minds.

In deed, there is scarcely a place out there that will preach truth,
even a proper University will rely on the scholar to find the reproducible result.

Removing falsehoods,
is a healthy, and mighty, part of growing up.

---

Books that are held in high esteem by the wise and intellectual,
will hasten and balance the process discovering truths.

A book, or a narrated book, that shares true wisdom,
is a briefcase of good ideas, and treasures for our minds (or upgrades if you are technologically inclined).

Without books, we would be struck by the urge to visit Universities, and lecture halls,
and to write to those who have things to say, which is what would cause them to share wisdom or letters in books.

Many people need to hear a book,
and it truly a beautiful experience to hear a book read by its author.

Equipped with a couple of hundred narrated books,
you can easily inherit lifetimes of knowledge and experience.

---

Falsehoods are harder, and take longer to get rid of than you think,
as they often embedded in, and obscured by, our lifestyles, family culture, neighborhood culture, and even national culture.

But there is a sure cure for that,
a very noble tradition, practiced by humans probably for tens of thousands of years.

In Modern Day, that is the act of buying a backpack, and bug spray, and strangely overpriced pants and shoes,
and a tent, or a hammock tent, and reconnecting with nature on long and winding trails.

Quests, that require a lot of walking,
that pull you out of your environment, and give you a healthy substitute for a prolonged period of time.

---

Think about how your mind changes when you go on a vacation,
how you become more contemplative, relaxed, and become more of yourself.

Know, that,
that is the real you.

When your mind is rested and unstressed
it is most receptive to growth, to growing up, to being Human.

Many people start reading books on their vacations,
that is because reaching out for knowledge about or wisdom from other lives, is a very natural thing for us.

---

The power of falsehoods,
is too often impossibly overwhelming.

Talking about it and thinking about it is not enough,
when falsehoods grab a hold of us, we too often point ourselves away from the right way, and make things worse.

Falsehoods can stress us to self medicate with overeating,
they have the power to make ourselves ill.

Falsehoods like the belief that out poverty is our fault,
can press us into a job where we never read a book, and never take to wisdom.

In conclusion of this text,
I must ask you to make a powerful change.

I have to ask you,
to go on a marvelous shopping expedition for camping gear, and go on a long and deeply relaxing vacation.

And never return to the mindset that you left behind when you set off for that quest,
you must use your power to live your life in the state of mind brought on by a vacation.

Know that whatever troubles you left behind as you went on your vacation,
have always been holding you back and are preventing you from growing up.

---

You are a Noble and Beautiful Human Being,
you are mean to grow, to reach for Knowledge, Wisdom and Greatness.

Nothing must stand in the way of your growing up,
without growing up you will never become yourself.

When you grow,
the world grows along with you.

Please go on a vacation,
and don't comeback.

Become,
a Great Being.

Grow,
Free.
