The Serious Business Of Trouble-making

(SEE https://catpea.com FOR FULL VERSION, YouTube has a 5,000 word limit.)

The best kind of trouble is the trouble you create for yourself,

there is no limit to how elaborate of a problem you can invent.

Relativity and contrast play a very important role here,

the lower you are and the higher you aim the more it is worth the trouble.

It is safe to say that a nice and comfortable bed with an electric blanket,

on a quiet and sleepy afternoon is a pretty good low.

A pretty good height to reach is either ten miles by foot,

or 1,500 miles by car where it usually involves a beach somewhere.

Moreover, you need a team deadline, a snooze button, a soon to end semester,

and an ungrateful team where you do all the work, add a few bullies...

and your co-worker whispering:

"Why did she get a raise, she doesn't know anything" - emphasizing "she doesn't know".

While not purrfect, this is a really good start,

and erasing the deadline from its existence, is a sweet-sweet cherry on top.

There are too more things you could use, a handful or ungrateful friends,

and a really well thought out backpack, and a large solar charger you can hang on the back.

See, you are not just headed for Key West and back,

I m sure you will stop at all the antique stores, and hopefully pawn shops as they have good stuff too.

A good pawn shop somewhere down in Florida or by an ocean is sure to have a cheap Wet Suit,

it is a little known fact that they aid your buoyancy, it is like wrapping your self in a wee boat.

I think it is really important to consider stopping by the highway accessible State Parks,

they are usually there because something beautiful is going on.

You never know what you find, it could be a little lake, maybe enormous dunes,

it could be a hill with a historic watchtower of a lookout, or it could be a stable, with horses.

For example the reason why someone loses their 4.0 may have nothing to do with their performance,

but with the teacher giving out too many A/s in the previous semester, and now just trying to average things out with the people who never complain, so that the dean doesn't come around complaining that his class sticks out.

It doesn't matter if it is High School, or College, or what used to be a Dream Job,

there are unethical fake it until you make it people covering their asses everywhere, it is a tragedy that someone like that should become a reason behind someone's years of suffering.

These are simple examples I am making up,

in real life, there is no understanding of all the motives as people who never grew up, constantly interact with each other to to do less, and get more,

Trouble-making is just a lighthearted way of leaving all that noise behind,

and regaining your own beauty, and strengths, and awe for the world around you.

Give yourself some trouble that actually makes you better for a change.

if the path you re walking on feels wrong, you need to begin preparing an adventure backpack.

A very special Monday is coming around,

your clock will go off just like always.

But this time it will die with a sad whimper as you - slowly and deliberately - unplug it from the wall,

and return to sleep, not worried about your deadline, job or school, but simply knowing full well, that they don't matter anymore; because your well being is infinitely more important.

Then get into your car, or on a bus, and set a direction for sunny weather,

drive, fly, just go, and do not wait to create your rules of adventure, do it as soon as possible.

When your health returns to you,

you'll know exactly where you are going, and schools will always take you back, and jobs that hurt you are now worthy of your concern at all.

Don't make plans about the rest of your life until you catch up where you need to be and become wiser as think things through.

And finally, if you don't like the idea of trouble making,

then between You and I let us call it: Love of Life.
