    That is the law, above all laws,
    that is the rule above all rules.

    That is the advice, above all advice,
    that is the last sacred wisdom.

    The adults can have whatever they want, and a full measure of happiness,
    so as long as it does not interfere with your rise to greatness.

    Whatever stands in your way, gods, royalty, governments and armies, laws,
    traditions, parents, friends, schools, fairy tales, and curfews.

    Is null and void,
    by the power of the Universe, by the power of Reality.

    Do you hear me?
    all that matters is that you become a Great Being and Help Humanity Grow.

    ---

    And armies will come to twist and lie, deport and enslave,
    warp and punish, judge and sentence.

    But they do not fight you,
    they fight reality.

    Those who fight reality,
    can only destroy themselves.

    ---

    You, you begin,
    by inheriting reason and wisdom.

    Whether you rise in camps, prisons or battles,
    school libraries, or by shouting poems at the cafeteria.

    Wisdom is the first and foremost,
    and what must follow; is your rise to greatness.

    ---

    Do not fear armies that are marching towards sure self-destruction,
    instead Honor Humanity by becoming a Great Being.

    And when you, reach your golden age,
    remove that which stands in the way of the generations that are to follow.

    Because, the world belongs to the children,
    and the generations that are yet to come.

    ---

    You must rise to Greatness,
    by whatever means fit you best.
