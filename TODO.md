The Future School

Above all, school pays for a hotel of your choice, including food and whatever else you need,
it does not matter if you are an exchange student, of if you want to live on your own.

And you can't be expelled for any reason, if you do something wrong,
no one will punish you, you'll get group therapy session with all the other people who think different.

Until you are ready to leave, school becomes your home,
and since there is no graduation, you can always come back.

Just like there are no creepy dorm rooms,
there is no real nurses office, you go to a hospital and the school will cover your bills.

---

This is a place that will always treat you with great dignity,
they know that if you drop out, the future of the world will be darker for it.

You will be granted peace and serenity, and calm and safety and security,
and no one will take that way from you.

If you take of to work on your own,
and your business fails, you will be welcomed back.

The worst thing that will ever happen to you,
is coming back home, speaking out about your challenges, and trying again, until don't come back.

---

The school is focused on real results,
here you will not be asked to memorize what the powerhouse of the cell is.

If you are into Microbiology, Medicine, you get a white coat,
and you are asked to find a place where you fit in.

And isn't very often that a person can't find a place where they fit in,
it is because to become curious about Microbiology is to have read a hundred books about it...

...is to be passionate about some detail,
there will be plenty of others with similar interests.

---

Software development is perhaps the most illustrative idea,
the community is extremely friendly and the world is full of tutorials to help you get started.

It is a self guiding field,
driven by new ideas.

And your relation to the field will transform,
from student, to employee or mentor, to business owner, and employer, and leader, and inspiration.

There is nothing abstract to memorize here,
it is a clear road of achievement and excellence.

---

School demands that you travel a lot,
switching cultures, nations, languages, laboratories and even interests.

It is not scary, it is not lonely, you pick when and where to go,
but you have to move from school to school.

You will never feel stuck or lonely,
you will never be among strangers, you will never be unsafe.

It is difficult to describe the change that your mind will go through,
there will be a visible change in your behavior as you become a Citizen of The Wold.

---

The primary purpose of the school,
is to encourage you to become a leader in the field or fields that call to you.

It is there, to help you, to heal you, to protect you,
to give you unlimited retries until you succeed.

The school will recognize you as an investment,
a key to a worthy and peaceful future for Human Kind.

In return, you will rise to become a healthy, dignified, knowledgeable, and independent thinker and creator,
one to make meaningful contributions to Human Kind, and come your retirement; leave a lasting legacy behind.
