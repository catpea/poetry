Learning From Tutorials

I still have a world to go before I feel comfortable dancing to my dance songs,
I have no other choice, in a few day every Cutting Shape song will go bad on me.
I danced to my own music before,
but it was just drums and samples, it wasn't anything fancy.
For the past couple of days I've been searching for "Techno Tutorials",
whatever it is that I am learning, I always search for THING + the word tutorials.
That's how I learned my early programming languages,
one exception was art, it just came to me one day to point an Office Projector on oil canvas.
Three months ago, I searched for "Shuffle Dance Tutorial",
I think that is my favorite one, I feel amazing.
Whenever a tutorial talks about something,
there is a strong hint of a procedure.
Unlike in a school lecture,
that has no rhyme or reason, and plenty of noise.
Thus far my favorite video is How to produce Techno #1 - The Basics",
by Dash Glitch on YouTube.
I don't know the program he is using,
I am just re-creating the things he talk about with lmms.
And I learned how to use lmms by just expecting a canvas that will help me arrange song structure,
and then wanting to see a piano roll, and a beat sequencer.
The need for piano roll and beat sequencer
came from a tutorial on https://learningmusic.ableton.com/
So first I looked at how to make beats and melodies,
and then practiced with the free lmms program, and now I am breaking down techno.
I already made a tiny test song this afternoon,
and in deed following the Dash Glitch procedure will create a unique techno song each time.
Once I feel comfortable with that,
I will move on to create dance friendly songs, which is still basically techno.
Without the procedures that Dash Glitch and many other YouTubers present,
the songs come out too rough.
But by taking the same steps they are, and paying attention to the same details,
following the general procedure they reveal, it only takes a few minutes to make a new song.
So open up the internet, type in whatever you are interested in learning, followed by the word "Tutorial",
and I am certain it won't take you very long to show amazing progress.
