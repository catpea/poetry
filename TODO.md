Bad Grades Are Meaningless Grades

You have to punch through what everyone else is saying,
if something feels wrong, you walk, you get out, you don't let people push you.

---

Long time ago, we had these little schools,
that taught reading, writing, and arithmetic.

And people loved them, everyone loved and admired them,
it was a true gift, and teachers were True Angels of Wisdom.

---

But schools require funding,
part of that funding is paying teachers.

And what that means is:
money.

Everyone suddenly was a teacher,
and to optimize money, testing, testing, testing.

This is not a school anymore,
this is a business, all the teachers now take a paycheck home.

---

The concept of grades is very iffy, very lazy, a teacher should talk to the parent.
if grades used to work, then maybe they didn't matter much, somehow.

But over time,
with everyone busy optimizing things to get or make more money.

With schools everywhere needing funding,
with teachers needing to get paid.

Nobody would have noticed,
when grades became everything.

Same with tests, nobody noticed when lectures became too abstract,
and people just started memorizing for tests to get good grades.

---

So now, we have a school, that needs funding,
teachers that need to get paid.

And lectures and tests,
setup in a way where majority passes by memorization.

---

And then there are those who assume that teachers are there to teach,
and that the abstract disconnected lectures actually make sense.

They don't know everyone is memorizing,
they assume they are just not smart enough.

C, and D, an occasional B+. but mostly Cs,
it wouldn't occur to them that teachers are looking at other classes and give the same grade.

Nor would it occur to them that statistically a certain number of students,
should have bad grades, and the teacher will make that happen as not to stick out.

---

And then there is the big one, the biggie,
the one that nobody talks about, that inconvenient fact.

The grades, are actually a performance score of how well the teacher is teaching,
and they have not a darn thing to do with any of the students.

---

You can't learn disconnected facts,
you can only temporarily memorize them.

Your grades are are reflection of how inclined you are  to participate in a memorization charade,
that fetches the teacher money, and keeps your school operating.

They have to get paid,
they have to put food on their table.

They can't teach, because that would mean addressing every student,
that is just not possible, and they would rather get a job elsewhere.

More importantly, they won't know, they won't even care, when you do find something that you like,
they will take that away you, because there is no time for you to learn, you have to pass tests that are in class right now.

---

If you don't pass the standardized tests that are an insult to your uniqueness, your predispositions, talents and creativity,
the teacher will have to be transferred to another school as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hh6uHUx728">lemon</a> and that makes them look bad.

How dare you,
how dare you little child.

They will behave high and mighty,
while selling your mind for a paycheck.

Do yo see?
do you see?

The tests were never a judgment of you,
they are just the simplest way to track who the worst teachers are.

Everything that surrounds you in school is created with the least amount of effort,
they are using grades to make you feel bad, so that you will memorize and pretend to learn, so that everyone keeps getting paid.

That is what the teacher wants,
put food on the table.

They don't know what it means to get bad grades,
the fact that they are a teachers shows that they crammed, memorized and probably were proud of their meaningless grades.
