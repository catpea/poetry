Self Awareness, Open Your Eyes And Rise

Break out of broken education, religions, governments, and status quo,
do not fear those who secretly fear you, you are a Citizen of the World first.

Be careful, don't let liars make a fool out of you,
poverty is everywhere, and it fractures those who can't handle it.

Poverty, frequently causes a poverty of mind,
then all the creativity that makes a person amazing, turns dark.

You have to look around, understand the nature of things,
that's exactly what books can give you, and school can never teach you.

---

Self awareness is about gaining some grasp on the layers of influence you are under,
this is so incredibly error prone that people rarely get it right at first.

In their haste for truth they invent things that are not real,
our inability to see what is holding us down is a nightmare.

But not breaking out, is worse than a nightmare, it is a life sentence,
victims of cults, bad parenting, strange or frightening beliefs, eventually unravel.

---

The road to self awareness, is a road to understanding what is real and
what has been pulled over our eyes to have us serve some purpose.

Sometimes servitude has been so optimized that no one being can spot it,
it takes thousands of people and their donations to catch on the fraud.

Therefore, all people must do their travel upwards, out and over, any and all influence,
and books are critical to helping us up, and towards knowledge and wisdom.

---

Freedom is the first and foremost human right, freedom to go anywhere,
freedom to think anything, freedom to dream and share, freedom of speech and inspiration.

---

Now, look at school, look how easily you accepted your grades,
how easily you got misled into memorization and got cheated out of learning.

You never noticed school was bad,
even though it was unfair and often made no sense.

All this evidence, right in front of your eyes,
but you kept believing.


---

My Friends,
you are the New Generations, you are the change you hope to see.

You must practice self awareness,
and learn to see through what you have accepted for granted through the cultures you were born into.

Our task is to Unite Humanity so that there is no more War, no more Poverty, no more Lies,
so that all Darkness is brought into light of Wisdom, and for all to see.
