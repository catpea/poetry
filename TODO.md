You have one job,
only one worry.

Self education and search for meaningful knowledge,
and the question of whether or not you are learning fast enough.

---

The more knowledgeable you are,
the more lasting and sophisticated the choices you make; and the safer and more powerful you become.

Restriction of knowledge has sat behind all the world's greatest mistakes and evils,
it is the virus behind slavery and cults, criminal behavior, and all manners of misery.

---

Fear, fear is powered by lack of knowledge,
lack of confidence, hope, self esteem, brilliance, and strength in face of enemy comes from lack of knowledge.

It is an old trick, and the old saying goes,
an educated servant is a no good servant.

---

I think being tricked into thinking that what schools do is teach knowledge,
is just about the worst thing that has ever happened.

A narrated book, you can rewind, re-listen to, doodle with, go on adventure with, fall asleep to, travel with,
and set off on a great expedition with to find the paper version at that distant library to see if there are any pictures, is a great gift; a gift of wisdom.

---

It will keep you safe,
it will fuel your visions and expeditions, and adventures, and quests, and triumphs, and discoveries.

Once you make your way back to school, you'll be able to see how the teachers are just repeating things they barely understand,
they are just going off of a bare minimum script, they can't inspire because they don't know anything.

---

And No!
an entertaining and likable teacher, is just the same thing.

They can't be your friends,
and you need to learn, so that you are safe, and can live your life without becoming torn by some damn darkness, and betrayal, and depression that comes along with it.

---

Anything that tries to interfere or substitute for your pursuit of knowledge,
will only add to the danger of going through life with less knowledge than cunning liars.

Even teachers don't understand how important knowledge is,
most probably don't even know, what it is.

---

It comes out of the soul trapped in a book,
the soul that you aim to befriend and hope to understand.

And it comes in golden flakes, a layer at a time,
when you are starting to learn-for-real the flakes are little, but as your body of knowledge continues to develop they grow in size and weight.

---

The way you move, alters,
the depth of your care for strangers becomes more urgent.

And every step in your life becomes more meaningful and patient,
until knowledge reaches that tipping point where you begin synthesizing your own ideas out of what you already know, and your steps slide into infinity.

---

And as you travel unlimited roads, you begin understanding where things go wrong,
and you are able to see what is needed to fix it.

A world freed from poverty with free basic income programs,
a world where teachers can stop acting and pretending so that they may put food on their table, and begin asking what education really is, and how to get there.

Meanwhile the students race forward to avoid all the early mistakes described in paperbacks countless times,
leaning forward to race faster, they continue increasing their slope of pursuit of knowledge, and quality of self education.

---

It is not a dream,
it isn't poetry, this is your world, this is your time.

And we must all become wise,
so that the world may continue to grow in safety and in balance.

This is your life.
