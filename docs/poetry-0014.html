          <p>Quarantine Day Ten. My arms grew so powerful from all the rest that I mistakenly struck myself several times. I busied myself today relearning how to handle all my amazing strength. Renamed Hash Bang to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)">Shebang</a>, as it is the most commonly used variant. Begun working on a beat sequencer, and a song maker. The idea here is that Chords, Bass, Melodies can all be handled by the <a href="https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js/wiki/Arpeggiator">Arpeggiator</a>, but the beat is a bit more complex, and needs a little tool. The tool I have up today uses re-styled checkboxes, a perfect fit for the sequencer.</p>
