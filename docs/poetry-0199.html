          <p>Writing is like the spinning top in Inception,</p>
          <p>it is a way to self evaluate.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>If you continue being unable to write,</p>
          <p>then it means you are surrounded by invisible walls.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Being able to lay down your favorite thoughts on a piece of paper,</p>
          <p>and helping to inspire or enlighten someone, is a sign of health and inner-freedom, and in some cases Greatness.</p>

          <p>There are many styles of writing,</p>
          <p>and many directions.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>My style of writing is patterned after poems,</p>
          <p>I write two sentences per stanza, if I need a third sentence,</p>
          <p>then it generally means I over-complicated something.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I think my favorite aim is to turn my little poems,</p>
          <p>into little movies and stitch them together into a tiny documentary.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I&apos;ve heard of a project called <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/hannah_brencher_love_letters_to_strangers?language=en">Love Letters to Strangers</a></p>
          <p>and I find that to be the sweetest aim of all.</p>

          <p>In the larger scope,</p>
          <p>we must all write to update the surface for future generations to stand on.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>The books our parents read are great, by they are a bit old fashioned,</p>
          <p>we have to, rebuild the library for the future generations.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>We don&apos;t want the future to start with our parents,</p>
          <p>we want them to start where we left off,</p>
          <p>so that we may spare them the aches we went through.</p>

          <p>Things change.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>When we talked about climate 50 years ago,</p>
          <p>there was still a chance to become educated about it and make informed decisions, today.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>But, today, all we got is the observation that climate appears to have become more unstable,</p>
          <p>and most are not educated enough to make any sense of it, or agree on any solution.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And that the world lost two-thirds of its wildlife is last 50 years,</p>
          <p>people are too desperate for food, money, housing and health, to grasp what that means.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>We need a new perspective on dealing with climate change,</p>
          <p>because a world uneducated on the subject,</p>
          <p>is a world that will never reach a consensus, and may never do anything about it.</p>

          <p>Writing a book will tell you if you have the knowledge you think you do,</p>
          <p>there are many teenagers, that feel they have mastered Quantum Physics; bless their Great Hearts and Beautiful Minds.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>However, they can only write an assay or two,</p>
          <p>they can&apos;t synthesize new ideas to fill a book.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Feeling smart is a very healthy sign, that a person is headed in the right direction,</p>
          <p>but writing a book is a sign that they have traveled a considerable way there, and are of great health.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>You can see what it means to be able to write a book much more clearly in this example in particular,</p>
          <p>it means Freedom and Power of Mind, falling short is just... Dreaming.</p>

          <p>There is a very powerful kind of book, that perhaps is most important,</p>
          <p>and only a young person, during their youth can write it.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Brilliant Teenage Minds that made some headway in life,</p>
          <p>writing advice to their peers, that have unfortunately gotten stuck, or fallen.</p>

        <section>
          <p>Opening ones heart at a young age, is a very noble thing to do,</p>
          <p>it is a sign of Great Beauty, Compassion and Grand Heroism.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Those books, must not be judged by adults,</p>
          <p>their creators must understand not to judge their creative writing by adult standards.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Adults are not what they seem, for one;</p>
          <p>and second the people who benefit from those books are teenagers themselves.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>A person who is suffering early in their life,</p>
          <p>is best helped by the words of someone who has recently managed to rise out of similar problems.</p>

        <section>
          <p>Our youth is the most formative period of our life. Even the smallest of pains spared,</p>
          <p>or littlest of mistakes avoided will have massive and profound influence over us, come our middle age.</p>

        <section>
          <p>Write to pull yourself up by your own bootstraps,</p>
          <p>write to become a beacon</p>
          <p>write to become a light of enlightenment.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Write to bring back what has been written a generation before,</p>
          <p>if the story is worth the while, retell it, retell it countless times.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And when you are ready to lay down your pencil for the day,</p>
          <p>read, read it out loud, and record it,</p>
          <p>because the light in your voice is worth a million books.</p>

          <p>It is how the next generation learns from the previous one,</p>
          <p>it is how they win the wars we could only hoped to have won.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>It is how they become the heroes we hoped to be,</p>
          <p>it is how they save the world, that we can&apos;t see.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Write, because that&apos;s how you! become the hero you hoped to be,</p>
          <p>and because the world belongs to the future generations,</p>
