          <p>Taking Things for Granted.</p>

          <p>that we are merely born into.</p>
        </section>

        <section>

          <p>Remember, first you must learn to resist indoctrination,</p>
          <p>resist taking things for granted, resist following leaders you don&apos;t know,</p>
          <p>resist the fallacy of choosing the lesser evil.</p>

          <p>To repeat one of the quotes by Robert Ardrey that Sir Ken Robinson was fond of,</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>&quot;...We were born of risen apes, not fallen angels,</p>
          <p>The miracle of man is not how far he has sunk</p>
          <p>but how magnificently he has risen.</p>
          <p>We are known among the stars by our poems...&quot;</p>
