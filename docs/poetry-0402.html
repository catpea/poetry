          <p>&quot;The biggest thing in art, is getting the proportions right.&quot;</p>
          <p>-- Abraham Lincoln</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>To get the proportions right you should use an office projector,</p>
          <p>see if a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/pico-projector/s?k=pico+projector">Pico Projector</a> is right for you, they are often about $50.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>There are other ways you can transfer proportions,</p>
          <p>print your subject on paper, and some graphite on the back of your printout.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Then put your graphite backed printout over your artwork paper,</p>
          <p>and mark all the important spots with a pencil, the graphite backing will leave gentle marks on your art paper.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Above all you need a good photo, preferably a portrait, possibly your own,</p>
          <p>but you have to make sure, that your light source is casting some shadows.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Take a look at Mona Lisa, look how dark her neck, and areas above eyelids, look at her nose,</p>
          <p>it is both completely submerged in the shadow and casts it too.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This is no coincidence, arranging light and shadow before making a portrait is a huge deal,</p>
          <p>if there is just soft light shining straight at the face, you will not be able to speak with shadows.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Take a good photo, put it on your computer, use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6pXJ7Ijir0">GIMP</a> to tweak the shadows, explore contrast,</p>
          <p>and then project it on you art paper, get some <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=Strathmore+Drawing+14%22x17%22">14x17 drawing (not sketching) paper</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Start outlining where all the shadows are,</p>
          <p>use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Staedtler+Lumograph+Graphite+Drawing+and+Sketching+Pencils&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2">art pencils</a>, they differ in intensity and hardness.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Pencils marked HB, H, 1H, etc are hard and thus leave a light gray color on paper,</p>
          <p>pencils marked B, as in 1B, 2B, 3B and so on, are soft and leave a deep rich dark color when used.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>So you would use maybe 4B for Mona Lisa&apos;s eyes,</p>
          <p>but HB to draw her hair, or veil - or her eyebrows, if their absence bothers you as much as it bothers me.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Don&apos;t press your pencils into the paper,</p>
          <p>don&apos;t scar the paper as that is hard to erase.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And use a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Staedtler+Blending+Stump+Set&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss">Blending Stump</a>,</p>
          <p>to smooth everything out.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You will also need a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Tote+Board&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2">drawing board</a>,</p>
          <p>so that you can take your outline sketch outside, maybe a coffee shop, or a park, or a lake.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Drawing at home is very difficult,</p>
          <p>art is about adventure, and nature.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If it is too difficult to go outside a little bit,</p>
          <p>then go all out, take a picture of an interesting building by a bench you can sit on, prepare your sketch...</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>and go to the bench where you took your photo,</p>
          <p>now that your sketch has all the proportions right, you can just look at your subject without photo reference to add the shades and blend all the shadows.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Sometimes people come around, all enchanted by your art,</p>
          <p>and sometimes you meet another artist, everyone is always very nice and sophisticated.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The thing that creates an artist,</p>
          <p>is being - out there - doing art.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>So, go,</p>
          <p>go right now, and don&apos;t stop.</p>
