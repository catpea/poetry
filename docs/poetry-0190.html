          <p>No one person can save the world,</p>
          <p>we have to take turns because of how exhausting that is.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>No one person can speak to the whole world,</p>
          <p>the world is too complex and our voice and message will become too scattered.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>We just need to keep speaking until the message of leaving bad ideas behind becomes less and less blurry.</p>

          <p>Our problem is not so dissimilar</p>
          <p>from the problem of a victim of a cult.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Our problem works on the same principle,</p>
          <p>limited knowledge, limits our awareness,</p>
          <p>limited awareness constricts us to a subset of reality.</p>

          <p>Five hundred years ago Human Beings were just as intelligent as we are,</p>
          <p>they simply knew less, were aware of less.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>The culture and popular beliefs were rooted, in less.</p>

          <p>Another example is raising a child,</p>
          <p>with the genetics of someone from 10,000 years ago; today.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Growing up today would make them, just an average person,</p>
          <p>they would not wish to take a bite out of a Woolly Mammoth,</p>
          <p>or hope to own a Giant Ground Sloth, not anymore than we do.</p>

          <p>They&apos;d appreciate the iPhone, in form of the model they appreciate the most,</p>
          <p>and had they been made aware that they are of the Ice Age,</p>
          <p>they&apos;d sweetly and jokingly name their kitty cat, Scrat.</p>

        <section>
          <p>Our knowledge and the culture we grow up in, is extremely influential,</p>
          <p>it decides how we develop, who we become, and what we recognize as reality.</p>

          <p>A child born a couple of hundred years for now,</p>

        <section>
          <p>In the schools of tomorrow, they will learn that we were victims,</p>
          <p>of broken educational systems, and cultures that didn&apos;t encourage pursuit of Wisdom.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>To put it simply, some things sneak into us based on the level of our knowledge,</p>
          <p>and the height of development of the culture we are born into.</p>

          <p>Geniuses.</p>

          <section>
            <p>This is very important, it is a very important single word answer,</p>
            <p>to a very important question, that has great impact on the future of humanity.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>We are Geniuses.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>You know that man that is always wearing old clothes,</p>
            <p>and kind of works in a corner, and acts a little odd.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>He is also a genius.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>He is dying from loneliness, his mind is warped from ages of overwork,</p>
            <p>he can&apos;t really connect with people anymore because he has been feeling like an outsider for too many years,</p>
            <p>he found comfort in his corner, where he is safe and where his life is simple.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>But, should a chain of events push him,</p>
            <p>he will shed the patina of isolation, he will force himself to inherit modern culture and lifetimes from books,</p>
            <p>and genius will return, it will be fresh, raw, reignited, he may for a moment become the wisest being on earth.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>That&apos;s what genius is,</p>
            <p>a combination of unbreakability, and intellectual infinity.</p>

          </section>

          <section>
            <p>We are a very odd Form of Life compared to all the other animals on Earth,</p>
            <p>we are self aware, and we are able to evaluate, and adjust, we are self enabling.</p>

              <p>We will learn, we will teach ourselves to become genius,</p>

              <p>My Friends,</p>
              <p>I wish there was more I could to to help you believe that you are each a genius.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <p>But I can only give you the books.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <p>I can&apos;t put the ear-buds in your ears and press play,</p>
              <p>because to hear the books you have to slow down in life,</p>
              <p>you have to begin questioning the things that were driving you,</p>
              <p>and you have to become ready to listen,</p>
              <p>and by that time you can press play on your own.</p>

              <p>A genius is not an intellectual anomaly,</p>
              <p>even Savants spend years mastering their tricks.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <p>We are all capable of gaining Powerful Intelligence,</p>
              <p>and we don&apos;t need schools for that,</p>
              <p>just a mountain of down to earth books made heavy with lifetimes of wisdom.</p>

              <p>You don&apos;t need to memorize Mathematical Formulas,</p>
              <p>and the last place you want to learn about Biology, is Biology.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <p>What you need is stories that teach you about the reasons behind the invention of mathematics,</p>
              <p>and and an adventure where you re-invent mathematics from scratch, with the fantastic and magical ability to look some stuff up along the way.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <p>You don&apos;t need to learn about the powerhouse of the cell,</p>
              <p>you need to begin with Stromatolites, Panspermia, Evolution and Astrobiology.</p>
              <p>Mitochondria used to be a separate organism, what an adventure to follow, what an honor to make new discoveries on that path.</p>

              <p>You must begin your education by pushing everything that interferes with your Natural Genius away,</p>

            </section>

              <p>it is not just the tigers that need help,</p>
              <p>the task at hand if far greater.</p>

            <section>
              <p>With ten million people in cages around the word,</p>
              <p>we have to help children and students of today,</p>
              <p>out of poverty, and towards real education,</p>
              <p>so that they may have a chance at a fair start in life.</p>
