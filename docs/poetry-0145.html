          <p>But the world is still growing,</p>
          <p>and it may neither fit not truly inspire you.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>So you have to find out what really moves you,</p>
          <p>what makes you stand on unshakable ground.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Accepting the responsibility for your own education,</p>
          <p>you must become authentic and unbreakable.</p>

          <p>Do not alter course for unimportant reasons,</p>
          <p>do not let strangers sway you.</p>

        <section>
          <p>Resist action without thought,</p>
          <p>and resist following orders without thinking.</p>
