        <section>
          <p>We are not Island Universes scattered to no end in some void,</p>
          <p>we are a part of a growing civilization with a past and a future.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And we might have become confused about the Scope of Our Existence,</p>
          <p>we stand divided by borders and committed to repeating history&apos;s mistakes.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>It is unwise to pretend to be able to handle a great responsibility,</p>
          <p>only desperation, fractures, and exploitation by other desperate pretenders can follow.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Those who are granted authority are often not wise enough to handle it,</p>
          <p>and in their mediocrity they commit what in larger scope translates to real Crimes Against Humanity.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>There cannot be wisdom without understanding and inheriting from past generations,</p>
          <p>the transfer of knowledge occurs by means of Understanding Books.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And there cannot be understanding without Authenticity,</p>
          <p>in haste of chasing a career there can only be memorization and misunderstanding.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>We must keep in mind; that what the future generations do not perceive as clear progress,</p>
          <p>will be seen as the continuation of dark ages with authorities on the wrong side of history.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>The World United, is not a fairy-tale, nor should it be a mere dream for us,</p>
          <p>but a Gift of Peace for The Future Generations, so that they may grow in Dignity, Health, and Wisdom.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>We are neither disconnected from the future generations, nor the past generations,</p>
          <p>we are a stepping stone in the development of The Human Kind.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And we should recognize this Great Honor and Reward,</p>
          <p>and understand that the larger context is found in helping to build a better world for future generations.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>All our decisions, across all levels and authorities,</p>
          <p>Police, Attorneys and Judges, Parents, Teachers and Principals, Mayors, Governors, Prime Misters and Presidents, and everybody else...</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Must be mindful of future generations, of a growing world, of making lasting and meaningful contributions to the entire human kind,</p>
          <p>a World that will eventually become united and free of borders.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>A world with future generations that will look back at us,</p>
          <p>right now, right here, with questions that we must present answers to.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>We are getting stuck in circles,</p>
          <p>because people are forgetting history&apos;s lessons.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Because we are not thinking on a large enough scale,</p>
          <p>we end up building more prisons rather than ending poverty with meaningful prevention programs.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Endless cycles of heartless poverty that freeze the best of us,</p>
          <p>poverty that wouldn&apos;t even be a feature of modern society had we in our wisdom recognized it for what it is.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Poverty denies people food and well being,</p>
          <p>causes stress and great harm to mind and body.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Love above Law, before we allow the practice of law,</p>
          <p>we must end the cycles of poverty.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Money must not be used to limit people,</p>
          <p>it is meant to help.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And how can a culture be to fail to see, how a young person allowed to build a business without the threat of homelessness and starvation,</p>
          <p>will contribute back to the city and everyone&apos;s well being.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>What is so hard about seeing that rather than sending non-violent criminals to prison,</p>
          <p>we can prevent their biggest mistakes by putting an end to their worries of sleeping hungry on the street.</p>
        </section>

        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Any time, we fail to keep to reality,</p>
          <p>be it sending a 15 year old lady to prison, or denying science, or tolerating arrests by obscured or unidentified agencies, or abuses of power or discretion.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>We create fractures and distrust,</p>
          <p>blindly defacing and destroying work of many much wiser great beings, who gave their best trusting that we can carry on, in wisdom.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>We must not move against the grain of reality,</p>
          <p>any and all divergence will only create a cascade of fractures that will demand constant attention</p>
          <p>and result in nothing more than systems that merely stand to support themselves and as an affront to justice and future generations.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Where there was once a solution as clear as helping children to inherit the wisdom of their elders,</p>
          <p>we now see the emergence of a failed and impotent educational system with a mass incarceration backed.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Wisdom and inheritance of knowledge cannot be replaced by a &quot;fake it until you make it&quot; trickery,</p>
          <p>the work of great beings must not be stained by people who fail to see their vision.</p>

          <p>Once again, the world grows a generation at a time,</p>
          <p>the education of the teenagers from 20 years ago is currently influencing the state of the world.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Likewise, how we treat out children today,</p>
          <p>will have a monumental impact on the world 20 years from now.</p>

        <section>
          <p>Let us honor our children and all the future generations by encouraging them to books,</p>
          <p>by reminding them of the Great Power of Thinking Beings, of Philosophers and Lovers of Wisdom.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>By reminding them that their Pursuit of Excellence,</p>
          <p>can only make the world a better place for us all, and even those that are yet to come.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Let us remind them that Books (and now Audio Books) serve as a wonderful source of our wisdom,</p>
          <p>especially when read in a sequence that fits them best, and understood at thier own pace.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <hr>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Let us remind each other that we must reject short thinking and shortest paths,</p>
          <p>that do not help the world grow and keep us divided.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Let us break out of that selfish endless loop of repeating mistakes of past generations,</p>
          <p>by working towards a better world a more united world where we recognize each other as One Family.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <hr>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And let us remember that the great and wise beings of past generations,</p>
          <p>demand that we honor hard won triumphs and do not repeat history&apos;s mistakes.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>The very nature of that demand requires that once we take to wisdom,</p>
          <p>we must stop following orders, and begin thinking, evaluating, and judging for ourselves.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>To honor triumphs and guard against heartbreaking mistakes,</p>
          <p>is the duty we hold to those who came before us,</p>
          <p>and all the future generations that are yet to follow.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <hr>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>As children we are asked to listen and follow,</p>
          <p>as we grow we must learn to Lead and become Unbreakable.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>It is not just the challenges of life that will test us,</p>
          <p>we must also think and evaluate and reject that which is wrong.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <hr>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>We are constantly made to listen and expected to follow,</p>
          <p>look behind any protest, or scandal, or angry headline.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>We must judge all the contradictory information for ourselves,</p>
          <p>and make an informed decision as to whether or not majority is correct.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <hr>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Life will always challenge us,</p>
          <p>and My Goodness - times are always changing.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Humanity is constantly bettering her self,</p>
          <p>what used to be acceptable - may now, be an affront to justice.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And while there isn&apos;t enough time to comprehend all the books,</p>
          <p>there is plenty of time to be come a Loving and Wise Compassionate Human Being,</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Let us remember that we are a chain-link between the Hard Work of Past Generations,</p>
          <p>and the United, Free from Poverty, and Peaceful Word of <strong>Future</strong> Generations.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>We are One Growing Family, and that is the correct context for local, state, and federal levels, for all legal and administrative decision making,</p>
          <p>to diverge from this reality is to get stuck in an endless loop of repeating history&apos;s mistakes, the very thing that the past generations are asking us not to do.</p>
