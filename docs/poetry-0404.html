          <p>The moment you write a program it starts becoming old,</p>
          <p>libraries become outdated, the user interface gets a smell.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In many cases once a program goes online it becomes vulnerable to attacks,</p>
          <p>and get this: attacks that didn&apos;t exist while the program was being written.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>To really write a program, a real program,</p>
          <p>you have to create a text description of it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Not some incomprehensible requirements document,</p>
          <p>but a book of many chapters, sections and paragraphs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You then have to create a private tool that converts your narrative,</p>
          <p>into tests that either pass or fail.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Pass means, that whatever the paragraph was describing exists,</p>
          <p>and works when provided some sample data.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Fail mean that the feature you described,</p>
          <p>has not yet been implemented.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>A really good description, would hold up under the stress of creating the same program,</p>
          <p>in different languages, by different development teams.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is the English description of your invention that is the real program,</p>
          <p>the code is just one of many implementations.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You don&apos;t need to learn programming languages,</p>
          <p>you need a Good Idea and a fine description.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Here are a few very brilliant programs that you can safely base your invention on,</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tc4ROCJYbm0">UNIX</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FquNpWdf9vg">HyperCard</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTdoFHTxQRI">Inform 7</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqxwwuUdsp4">WikiWikiWeb</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjdBEg5T11w">Siri</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAiFJEcqwm4">Visual Programming Languages</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zg-C8AAIGg">Infographics</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pV8-e_P7NWQ">Dashboards</a>.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This is a good starting point to thinking about Real Programming,</p>
          <p>where you deal with concepts, not code.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I think the most important type of a program the world needs today,</p>
          <p>is a Visual Programming Language with an easy on ramp.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Creating a programming language that would enable all human beings to collaborate on computer programs,</p>
          <p>would change the world.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And as you can imagine,</p>
          <p>this can&apos;t be designed by a programmer.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It can&apos;t be created from the inside, where programmers only think in code,</p>
          <p>and tend to follow requirements documents.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It has to be created from the outside of the software world,</p>
          <p>by making demands that must be met.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It has to be created,</p>
          <p>by a non-programmer.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It has to be revolutionary,</p>
          <p>because this will create a new computer revolution.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It has to work on the smart phone,</p>
          <p>perhaps it is something that looks at diagrams that are drawn on paper.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Maybe it is something that uses a special on-screen keyboard,</p>
          <p>where letters are replaced with words that can be strung together into commands like in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKlZzAWIlJc">old adventure games</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Once invented all other programs can be re-developed in this language,</p>
          <p>people will begin programming their homes, and cars, and even dance routines and workouts.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The question is: Who will lead the new computer revolution...</p>
          <p>Is it you?</p>
