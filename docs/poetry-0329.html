          <p>You may not realize that the way you have been treated in school,</p>
          <p>has been slowly turning you away from knowledge and wisdom.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>See, the teachers convinced us all that what they are doing is sharing knowledge,</p>
          <p>but it is actually the opposite of knowledge that they are sharing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Real knowledge comes with real results,</p>
          <p>fake knowledge depends on making you feel perpetually inadequate and then squeezes you into desperation just to make you thing you made progress as it pushes you along.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Real knowledge brings Happiness,</p>
          <p>it makes you ridiculous with your inventions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>With every cheerfully useless invention,</p>
          <p>you learn something priceless, and create an unspeakably beautiful addition to your Portfolio.</p>

          <p>As to the fantasy of good grades and good jobs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You shouldn&apos;t be surprised that the people who cram and memorize, do get the best jobs but only by cheating and lying, and manipulating, and by being well connected,</p>
          <p>thus, destroying the environments, and the very goodness of that position by creating that toxic environment.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We can all imagine that one perfect job, where creativity is cherished above all,</p>
          <p>and they would never hire a liar, because liars are toxic.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And we all need to stop with the fantasies,</p>
          <p>those jobs only exist when the company is forming, once they get that $100M venture capitol, only those who perform at maximum will be kept, and only until they burn out.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>No, no, no.</p>
          <p>It is not cool to live in the office drinking free energy drinks and writing your best code ever.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You need wisdom, balance, knowledge, dignity, Content of Character,</p>
          <p>being quirky in a high powered job where the suits don&apos;t even speak your language is not cool.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>All these people that you think don&apos;t get it, have negotiated contracts with expensive lawyers, and guaranteed golden parachutes,</p>
          <p>you are still the little guy, no matter how big your code.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>As sweet as those memories are,</p>
          <p>the job is not the point, our lives are meant to be lived in great dignity and wisdom, with great foresight and onward to creating a body of knowledge that will make lasting contributions to Human Kind.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You have to Think Big,</p>
          <p>there is no other way.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If there are temporary exceptions, the exceptions want you to have a real education,</p>
          <p>they want you to fight for real knowledge, so that they may love you for helping them grow.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>A 4.0 GPA has go nothing to do with those exceptions,</p>
          <p>memorization and cramming will prevent you from getting into one of those rare situations, even if you do come across it (most of us won&apos;t)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>

        <div class="section">
          <p>For you High School or maybe Middle School, or even college poses a confusing challenge,</p>
          <p>as you detect it is not possible to get an education because everything is too disconnected and you must memorize or you fail classes and destroy your GPA.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But for someone who is comfortable with lying,</p>
          <p>pretending to get an education, to get a dream job, is a dream come true.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>They actually make that dumb fantasy happen,</p>
          <p>but that life is stressful, unstable, and a house of cards.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Lying is like living life in a VR helmet,</p>
          <p>they aren&apos;t actually there, making that progress, they are still in High School, lying, pretending, still a kid.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Forget the fantasy of getting a good job for getting good grades,</p>
          <p>build your own companies, become an entrepreneur, the sooner the better.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is too unstable,</p>
          <p>life it too precious, and there are way too many moody people in your way, not to mention the liars.</p>

          <p>And no, graduating from MIT is still part of the same fantasy,</p>
          <p>you can&apos;t cram, it does not work, it doesn&apos;t do anything for your mind, you just end up with debt.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Brand-name colleges are not in the business of restoring authenticity to the world,</p>
          <p>they are in the business of staying in business and making people&apos;s education look rare and prestigious so that they can stick their foot in some door.</p>
        </div>

          <p>And a full ride scholarship, is never a full ride, they&apos;ll still make money of of you,</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The only way to win,</p>

          <p>I believe that too, and with tears in my eyes,</p>
          <p>that there are people up there that can help all of us, that they moment they see our hearts, they will never betray us.</p>

          <p>Listen up, listen,</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Forget the stupid fantasies,</p>
          <p>use them as a way to recognize signs of being misled.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>There is no diploma, there is no cake, the lady can&apos;t sing,</p>
          <p>it is just lies and liars, because they always, albeit temporarily, out compete the good people.</p>

          <p>Now listen carefully, eventually,</p>
          <p>you will become thirty five years old.</p>

          <p>It happens to all of us,</p>
          <p>few years before the middle age, we kind of slow down and take a look at ourselves.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is always an amazing experience,</p>
          <p>you get to see that you are more of yourself... you get to witness yourself.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You are almost able to keep extending that measuring stick,</p>
          <p>to kind of get an idea of where the heck you are headed, and what regrets may be, and what your elder-self is constantly complains about.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Once the 20s are over,</p>
          <p>you enter your age of enlightenment, where you get to synthesize new things out of what you have learned.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Is it a big deal to learn for real,</p>
          <p>getting to 35 on empty is scary.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It happens to good people too, often very delicate people get mislead by all this complexity, but they catch up very quickly,</p>
          <p>being strong and cheerful in a world of lies, still represents a hell of an education.</p>

          <p>At 40, it is time to begin polishing our wisdom,</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>At 40, we get to a point, where it becomes really meaningful,</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Liars end up in the beginning,</p>
          <p>they need to start learning from scratch, that is that mad circle.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But those who have taken to learning for real, who have great experiences to distill into wisdom,</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is the people who get launched 20 years ahead</p>

          <p>I can&apos;t stress this enough here, they need real knowledge, and an authentic struggle for real knowledge,</p>

          <p>All the choices combined to together,</p>
