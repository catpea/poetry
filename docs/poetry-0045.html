          <p>Everything is all right, except for our flight.</p>
          <p>But had we been given infinite light,</p>
          <p>our wings would fail in flight.</p>

        <section>
          <p>What gives us the right to learn, and rise to height,</p>
          <p>is the limit of the duration of our light.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>What makes it precious, and worth the flight,</p>
          <p>is precisely the limits in duration of our light.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>It is by our limits that we look to light,</p>
          <p>had we been given infinite flight,</p>
          <p>our intelligence would fail to light.</p>
