          <p>What we learn must be meaningful to us, it has to make us happy and fulfilled,</p>

          <p>Forcing you to take math,</p>

          <p>To learn math, you have to be inspired,</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The act of making you buy a purposefully overpriced calculator, maybe even the vapid self-published text book,</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In schools that do not show promised results,</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And then forcing you to work 26 hour shifts at Med School,</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Is an insult, it is a crime, it is evil,</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And above all, it will all stop you from learning,</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We can only learn by following our curiosities and expanding our predispositions,</p>
          <p>building vast networks of knowledge out of love of life and universe.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The love that the schools will rob us of,</p>
          <p>to try to fit us into a little box that they can grade and get paid for, while calling us names behind our backs.</p>

          <p>Real education,</p>

          <p>It starts with a stick in the ground,</p>
          <p>as you watch the way the shadow moves around it throughout the day.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And try to re-create the geometry necessary,</p>
          <p>to simulate the same motion, with what slowly builds as an unstoppable urge to learn math.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It starts with a sea shell,</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The Golden Ratio is too similar in too many things,</p>
          <p>and before you know it, you are looking beneath the fractals to discover chaos in unexpected places.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It starts with a hole in your curtain,</p>
          <p>the pinhole camera reverses the image, the light scatters when it hits a glass of water.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It scatters differently for different things,</p>
          <p>the secrets of the universe unravel.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It starts with a glimpse of a computer screen,</p>
          <p>something about those graphics catches your attention.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The game is playing it self,</p>
          <p>in a virtual world, where you can simulate interaction, a game theory.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It starts with a strange song and UFO sounds,</p>
          <p>that seems robotic and automatic like it is a computer program.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And now you are live coding music,</p>

          <p>No,</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Rather than a diploma, you need a beautiful portfolio documenting your inventions,</p>

          <p>Being stressed, threatened with debt, or punished with grades, insane teachers, or bullies,</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And working within this broken system by cramming,</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>High School diplomas are laughed at, and college is beginning to be perceived as,</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The facts are, that everyone knows schools are not working,</p>
