          <p>Techno is about love of technology,</p>
          <p>and there is nothing more technological than an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3udLCvoCC0">oscillator</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Oscillator oscillate,</p>
          <p>oscillation is about back and forth movement.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The music oscillator is the throat of a machine,</p>
          <p>it is the thing that generates the sound.</p>

          <p>Music is about breaking rules,</p>
          <p>a genre is about not breaking all the rules all at once.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In a techno song,</p>
          <p>we make most sounds with machine throats.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>There is a very interesting trick at play in a techno song,</p>
          <p>when we move the bass off the drum beat in a weird pattern it gives our song a unique melody.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The overall structure of a techno song,</p>
          <p>is about build up to a full melody, and then a wind down to the ending.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Interestingly enough there is a small tradition here,</p>
          <p>right after the melody is done playing turn off your beat, drums and base, just for a second.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Let us make a very simple and minimalist song,</p>
          <p>that touches upon the more important components of techno.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The special thing about this song is that it will capture the progress of making it self,</p>
          <p>so as we start you will only hear the sub layer, because the sub layer is the first thing we will work on.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We will then add the mid layer,</p>
          <p>and you will hear that as the song plays, you will hear the sub layer enriched with the mid layer, and so on.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The Sub Bass Layer, is a low and boring pattern at first,</p>
          <p>but once we get to the drum and hats we are going to mess it up, and our song will become richer for it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Here is the simple version:</p>
          <p>* SOUND OF SUB BASS *</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Now the Mid Bass Layer, it is a little bit more complex, and more notes are going to be hit,</p>
          <p>these are very machine like sounds you can hear the electricity here.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I think this is the most memorable part of hearing techno for the first time,</p>
          <p>I thought to my self when I was little &quot;that is the electronic in electronic music&quot;.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>* MID BASS *</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Now that three is something going on in our ears,</p>
          <p>now that we are sure our song will not be empty between the drums.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We add a pronounced drum, and we have to make sure to space everything out,</p>
          <p>so that our bass is not covered by the drum, we want out the sounds coming through.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I grew up with shorter sounding drums,</p>
          <p>ones powered by electricity and controlled by good old knobs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Here is what the song sounds like with our snappy drums now,</p>
          <p>* DRUM *</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Now we have a song going, we got bass we got drums,</p>
          <p>personally at this point I would add hats with a shaker to blend them in, kind of serve as an echo.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But instead we are going to warp the sub bass layer to give our song a sub pattern,</p>
          <p>I want you to hear it nice and clear.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In the first half of the sample that is about to play the the sub bass plays in a perfect sequence,</p>
          <p>in the second half you&apos;ll hear something come out of control.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Even though we only have sub bass, mid bass and drums, it sounds like something else is going on.</p>
          <p>* SUB BASS VARIATION *</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Now we add hats to make the song come alive, to get that main energy,</p>
          <p>it is not always best to add the shaker at the same time.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The shaker is basically the hat echo effect,</p>
          <p>and if we have a clean melody, we may only wish to hear crisp hats.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>So let us add the shaker separately in the next step,</p>
          <p>here are the hats:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>* HAT INTRODUCTION *</p>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And now let us add the shaker,</p>
          <p>I like my shaker short.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>* SHAKER DEMONSTRATION *</p>

          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Now let us add a simple melody as the main lead,</p>
          <p>there is no trick to it just find whatever you like.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>* MELODY *</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This is one of my favorites, it comes from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi5VTBdKbFM">Chopin&apos;s &#xC9;tude Op. 10, No. 12</a>,</p>
          <p>also known as the Revolutionary &#xC9;tude.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>At fist I start of with a short snippet that leaves the listener wanting,</p>
          <p>and then then I expand with a slightly sharper and longer variation that you heard here.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This is my go to song when I am studying something,</p>
          <p>my music teacher made it so that I would hate Chopin, but I failed that class.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is important that you reach out to big names for ideas,</p>
          <p>beautiful songs are great teachers, and we should all learn from the best.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Teachers that make us pretend to learn by forcing us to memorize under a threat of repeating a year,</p>
          <p>are just frauds.</p>

          <p>If there is one thing that you take away from this tutorial it should be that you are a genius,</p>
          <p>and that greatness is not a privilege for the lucky few.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Greatness is a reward for reading books, acquiring functional knowledge,</p>
