          <p>When you were a baby you could see the world well enough,</p>
          <p>but what made a difference was watching it for a while.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>By observing the world we made sense of it,</p>
          <p>we noticed how things connect; and learned to participate.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>But we are also very good at becoming better,</p>
          <p>and we won&apos;t notice a mis-observation.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Overwork, is one such thing,</p>
          <p>it makes everyone proud and happy, and it makes sense to try to make them even happier.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>But, that is a mistake,</p>
          <p>because your Life, your Living, and your search for meaning is far more important.</p>

        <section>
          <p>We have to continue observing the world,</p>
          <p>we can&apos;t just keep going forward based on observations we made as children.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>We have to notice that Poverty is a stupid problem,</p>
          <p>it should not be a part of modern society.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>No one should be homeless, no one should ever be hungry,</p>
          <p>and no one should suffer from a sustained thereat of poverty.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>It will only eve get fixed if you stop overworking,</p>
          <p>and start growing all the way up until you become a Great Being.</p>

        <section>
          <p>And we have to look at life from the point of view of Universe,</p>
          <p>it is the Greatest Thing, there cannot be greater.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>The Cosmos gave birth,</p>
          <p>we have emerged out of chaotic atoms and their configurations.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>It is not just a disgrace to surrender our minds,</p>
          <p>but also some kind of a Cosmic Crime.</p>

          <p>A mind must grow,</p>
          <p>to no end, and nothing is allowed to stop it. or hurt it.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Only from continued observation, and unimpeded growth,</p>
          <p>will we absorb enough of our surroundings,</p>
          <p>and inherit enough from the books that touch us,</p>
          <p>to find our &quot;meaning&quot; for the lack of a better word.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>MEANING, is the thing we notice when we look back from within the winter of our life,</p>
          <p>it is our Greatest Thing from the Greatest Time of our Life.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Overwork, fatigue, confusion, being too tired to learn or read,</p>
          <p>being too scared, or too worried,</p>
          <p>or focusing on things that are just unimportant in the end.</p>
          <p>Will interfere with our growing up, and our search.</p>

          <p>Please be careful my friends, be especially mindful of uttering these words,</p>
          <p>&quot;Oh, I can&apos;t do that anymore, I have a job now.&quot;.</p>

        <section>
          <p>Becoming a professional is useful though not required,</p>
          <p>Nurse, Mechanic, Programmer, Business Founder, it is all very interesting, captivating,</p>
          <p>but it is not that big of a deal - your Elder Self may see that as &quot;very little&quot;.</p>

          <p>My Dear Friends, having a career and some savings, is the least we can do in life,</p>
          <p>we are all capable of doing, a million times more.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And it does not mean that our greatest achievements will take a long time,</p>
          <p>no, sometimes it only takes five or ten years, maybe even less, maybe two.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>But it will be that defining creation,</p>
          <p>that will make all our previous works seem a million times smaller.</p>

          <p>They just didn&apos;t let overwork interfere with their mind,</p>
          <p>they didn&apos;t become the best employee, or the best student.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>They observed The World, The Universe, The Earth, The Life, The Human,</p>
          <p>and made their GPA or Promotion, a million times less important.</p>
          <p>In favor of the chain of things that really moved them in their deepest integrity.</p>

        <section>
          <p>Is she saying &quot;Work more?&quot;, &quot;Get more savings.&quot;, &quot;Put yourself in harms way for that promotion!&quot;,</p>

        <section>
          <p>or is she saying &quot;Pay attention to the Minds around You&quot;,</p>
