          <p>I know not how many times I revisited this project,</p>
          <p>how many times I rewrote this code over the years.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I know deep down in my bones that my code is revolutionary,</p>
          <p>it is not inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/samaaronuk">Sam Aaron</a> though he is living that dream.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is far more primal and guttural,</p>
          <p>and it comes from an old world war two bunker filled... with arcade games.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I always overshot my experiments,</p>
          <p>I used too many samples, I brought in too many risers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I wasn&apos;t paying attention because I wanted to fail at everything,</p>
          <p>as that is the most magnificent way of learning.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I let one of my earlier programs run overnight,</p>
          <p>it made 600 songs, and I worked out to them just fine.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>They weren&apos;t bad,</p>
          <p>but they needed to be more unique, they were reusing too many song parts.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I knew how to splice a song,</p>
          <p>but I didn&apos;t know how to build it ground up.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Some part of me assumed,</p>
          <p>that I would never know.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I knew that change was necessary,</p>
          <p>and I pushed my tidy music generator away.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And so begun my terrible mission of learning <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qfa9hGJzoY">lmms</a>,</p>
          <p>I figured out how to use the program pretty quickly, but I didn&apos;t know how music was built.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The <a href="https://learningmusic.ableton.com/">Learning Music Tutorial At Ableton</a>,</p>
          <p>helped me understand the components of a song, and notes, and octaves, and kick drums and hats.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The moment I knew I could make decent music in lmms,</p>
          <p>I stopped using it, it was over, done, hasta la vista.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Because I knew I had to go back to my program,</p>
          <p>to the thing that started it all.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I can teach lmms,</p>
          <p>but I should not use it to just make songs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I matured, musically speaking,</p>
          <p>but I am not a musician, I am at zero, though not in the minus anymore.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I understand what C4 means,</p>
          <p>I knew that before, but because of 2n, or 4n, notation that would frequently go along with the notes I felt I didn&apos;t know enough.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Now, I am not intimidates, 4n means quarter note,</p>
          <p>it does not mean four notes as one would guess.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is duration notation, it means a thing will go off four times within the space of a single note,</p>
          <p>or it will last quarter of a note, it is notation for units of time.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And I also know, there isn&apos;t much more than that,</p>
          <p>some exotic notation for chords perhaps, but I also know that chord theory can be pushed aside.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Today is the first day,</p>
          <p>that I have this program on my screen.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And I only told it to beat the drum,</p>
          <p>I now understand that the OOP class named Membrane Synth.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Is referring to the membrane that is stretched over a drum,</p>
          <p>I would normally assume that it is some kind of a synthesizer patch solution patter magic, but it is just a cute name for a drum synthesizer.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I kept my previous experiments to myself,</p>
          <p>but this one is published on the internet as open source and I named it <a href="https://github.com/catpea/westland">westland</a></p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It it used Tidal notation for construction of music,</p>
          <p>basically, if you are playing in the world of a quarter note, or 4n...</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You have four spots reserved for yourself,</p>
          <p>if you just use one spot, it will be multiplied four times.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But you are also allowed to use two notes in a singe spot,</p>
          <p>and they will hit at the speed of an eights note, or 8n.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The JavaScript array which is defined with square brackets,</p>
          <p>simply has anoter array embeded in it where the singe note used to be;</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>So it goes from [&quot;F4&quot;, &quot;F4&quot;, &quot;F4&quot;, &quot;F4&quot; ] which plays at the actual beats per minute of a song,</p>
          <p>to [&quot;F4&quot;, &quot;F4&quot;, [&quot;F4&quot;,&quot;F4&quot;], &quot;F4&quot;, ] and that plays the square bracket with the square bracket notes twice as fast.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This may sound weird, but you have to calm down from thinking computers,</p>
          <p>into the world where people would try to make music by banging sticks on a tree.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If you just hit the tree in succession,</p>
          <p>it will sound boring, if you whack it faster couple of time, it will sound like rock and roll.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Unlike Mr. Aaron,</p>
          <p>I need this music to be automatically generated by a computer.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Within that <a href="/audio/membrane-synth.mp3">terrible repetitive beat</a>,</p>
          <p>I will be focusing on creating symmetrical erosion of the beat pattern to create room for the dancers to do their tricks.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I will be applying filters and transformers,</p>
          <p>to that beautifully simple Tidal notation of [&quot;F4&quot;, &quot;F4&quot;, [&quot;F4&quot;,&quot;F4&quot;], &quot;F4&quot;].</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And this time, I am going to stick with the synthesizer,</p>
          <p>the program as a whole is just 18.3 kB, that is very tiny.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I hope a day will come where I will be able to generate fantastic dance and workout albums,</p>
          <p>which will contain music made by a machine, and thus never heard before.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It will still sound like popular Electronic Dance Music,</p>
          <p>but each song will come as a surprise every time.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Randomly configured classes of instruments,</p>
          <p>coming together to create songs respectful of dancers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>A lot of today&apos;s music is very distracting,</p>
          <p>it is really difficult to find the right setup.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And it is not even possible to share workout music,</p>
          <p>what a terrible mess.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If you fell like programming, or learning how to program music, Dear Reader,</p>
          <p>fork <a href="https://github.com/catpea/westland">westland</a> on github, which you can find on npm... and make it your own.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>May the magnificent Tidal notation,</p>
          <p>keep you wide awake at night.</p>
