        <div class="section">
          <p>Above all,</p>
          <p>know that this is a process.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Because we are susceptible to false beliefs,</p>
          <p>we must always be on a lookout for things that do not seem quite right.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

        <div class="section">
          <p>My go to simple example is the fact that we live in a state of Mutually Assured Destruction,</p>
          <p>there are about 2,000 ready-to-launch nuclear weapons that can be immediately deployed to destroy the world.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>My extreme example that is really hard to believe,</p>
          <p>is wage slavery, most people will deny it, resist it, and call me crazy for it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Having your children living paycheck-to-paycheck always under the cloud of medical and student debt,</p>
          <p>is wrong, humanity will not progress in this state.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Of course you can&apos;t just believe me,</p>
          <p>because that is how problems like this start in the first place.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You have to figure it out on your own,</p>
          <p>which is to say, build a path, at a steadily increasing slope, paved with a thousand books written by people wiser than their critics.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The way you find out if a person is wise or not,</p>
          <p>is by working your way up to that, by reading books.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>No one can tell you which books tot start with,</p>
          <p>but you can be certain that it is many books, and in the beginning most of them will be narrated for you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The way to find these books,</p>
          <p>is to dig through best seller lists.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>For example right now you may wish to look for top 10 audio books from year 2020,</p>
          <p>or for award winning audio books, more specifically look up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audie_Award">Audie Awards</a> (as in a.u.d.i.e).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Some Philosophers have flaws, but don&apos;t throw away their work,</p>
          <p>take it under your wings, make it better.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is a sacred thing,</p>
          <p>to bring beauty and innocence to some beautiful philosophy once stained by a madman.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In my experience Thinkers are Funny, and Profound,</p>
          <p>sometimes having made mistakes in their youth, is the very thing that launches them into that Love of Wisdom that immortalizes them.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>So if you find a work of philosophy that is not perfect,</p>
          <p>see if maybe your beauty can restore and fix it, try to save the work; rather than letting the ugly person drag it down into the darkness with him.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Aside from flaws and repairs, or perhaps forgiveness,</p>
          <p>you will also find that most books will teach you indirectly.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Most of the time, the title has nothing to do what the book is about,</p>
          <p>and the book will teach you a wisdom that has little to do with the main story.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Now, I always encourage non-fiction books, but I don&apos;t just mean scientific books, or philosophy and psychology,</p>
          <p>I think of memoirs and biographies as essential reading.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Here, reading about someone raised in a strange culture or family, can be _absolutely_ the most powerful thing in context of breaking out of some indoctrination.</p>
          <p>as the reader will be able to see their own invisible misfortune, by the magic of subtle analogy, to the events in the book that they are reading.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Often, different people reading or listening to the same book,</p>
          <p>will get a slightly different story out of it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This relates to the level of their knowledge, to where their curiosities lie,</p>
          <p>to the ways that they like to think, and to what they think the book is about.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It it of some importance to add,</p>
          <p>that every book a person reads, lifts them higher.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The height that this hints on,</p>
          <p>is the same height that Growing Up refers to.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

        <div class="section">
          <p>After a thousand books,</p>
          <p>it does not matter who took what out of which book.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Or which books or Philosophers they disliked,</p>
          <p>or what they thought was under-thought, or could be made better in some way.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>After a thousand books, even after a hundred audio books (and what could possibly be easier than listening to a book on some some fancy adventure),</p>
          <p>a person holds a solid dollop of wisdom in their being.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is like a torch, a lamp,</p>
          <p>and it is that light that we use to continuously monitor for more wisdom.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Which brings us full circle to the beginning of this text,</p>
          <p>you cannot be told what indoctrination you are stuck with, as that is the same mechanism that gets you stuck in the first place.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You have to build a wisdom, right in you, in your being,</p>
          <p>and that wisdom will enhance your perception, that is why we poetically refer to wisdom as a light - because it helps you see better.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>As you continue gathering more and more wisdom,</p>
          <p>you begin to see more and more, and you become less and less susceptible to false beliefs.</p>
        </div>

          <p>And here I want to close with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQfRdl3GTw4">Plato&apos;s allegory of the cave</a>,</p>
          <p>the only way that we can truly, and meaningfully, help each other, is with knowledge.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And not with any one book in particular,</p>
          <p>but with a hundred, with a thousand, with ten thousand, and fathom more.</p>
