          <p>Endurance, like speaking, or memorizing poems, and languages languages,</p>
          <p>or recalling details on the walls of our childhood home, streets of our city,</p>

        <section>
          <p>Like memorizing a poem, or learning a language it is a slow process,</p>

          <p>increase the beat of the music or our pace,</p>
          <p>and of course slowly increase the weight of the dumbbell.</p>
