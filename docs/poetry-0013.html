          <p>Captain&apos;s Log: Ninth Day of Quarantine: I found one more chicken, am ready for dinner. I created a small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundboard_(computer_program)">Soundboard</a> for what is basically a tiny collection of LOFI Hip-Hop sounds. A tiny collection will do, because we have the the synthesizer taking care of everything else. I added some Hip sounds to the THE WARRIOR Album Single and it does sound very well. Realistically it is difficult to call it music at this point, I have all the components but there were bugs along the way. <a href="https://sapper.svelte.dev/docs#Server-side_rendering">Svelte Sapper</a> is complicated to visualize, it pre-creates some things, meaning before I publish to the website, Sapper will create a pre-ran version of the site. When a visitor visits, the pre-ran (pre-generated static version) will then be upgraded to a real version, and replaced by now running live version. It is the correct technology, and it didn&apos;t get me, but it does take a moment to figure out when a bug jumps out of nowhere.</p>
