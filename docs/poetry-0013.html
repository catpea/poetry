        <div class="section">
          <p>The heaviest burden: What, if some day or night, a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>This life, as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more; and there will be nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh&#x2026; must return to you&#x2014;all in the same succession and sequence&#x2014;even this spider and this moonlight between the trees and even this moment and I myself. The eternal hourglass of existence is turned over again and again&#x2014;and you with it, speck of dust!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him: &quot;You are a god, and never have I heard anything more divine!&quot;</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>If this thought were to gain possession of you, it would change you as you are, or perhaps crush you. The question in each and every thing, &quot;do you want this once more and innumerable times more?&quot; would lie upon your actions as the greatest weight.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>Or how well disposed would you have to become to yourself and to life to crave nothing more fervently than this ultimate eternal confirmation and seal?</p>
