          <p>You don&apos;t really want to write your programs,</p>
          <p>you need to get good at program architecture, and programmer coordination.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You want to come up with a system,</p>
          <p>where many people can work on your big programs at the same time.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Writing little programs is fun,</p>
          <p>a one person program can become a piece of art.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Programming has a lot to do with creating universes,</p>
          <p>any kind of universe, in any kind of shape.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Remember that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrVpYwUFewU">inner fractal tesseract scene from interstellar</a>,</p>
          <p>that is where you go when you create universes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is a place where everything is strangely slid,</p>
          <p>except it is not as dramatic as the movie, and you can interact with everything.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You go into a world where anything,</p>
          <p>can be anything you want.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Things CAN get exotic if you put your imagination to it,</p>
          <p>creating a world in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqyV9Jmbex0&amp;t=150s">Inform 7</a> can be a wonderful experience.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Writing your own virtual world creation programs,</p>
          <p>where you can create abstract graphics and bend physics to your will can be fun.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Creating 2D games, scrolling games with Pixel Art and all kinds of new game mechanics,</p>
          <p>as in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-DpFmEzRJo">Mari0</a> (spelled with a zero) can be an amazing experience.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And games are the least of it,</p>
          <p>programming robots, drones, submersibles, to cross the Atlantic, automatically race, or fly in swarms... is like taking games outside.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And the moment you put that on the internet,</p>
          <p>you&apos;ll get job offers, and nobody is going to ask you if you completed High School or not.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Then, there is the research zone, there are <a href="https://github.com/catpea/papers-we-love">mountains of white papers</a>,</p>
          <p>and just as many helpful explanations, so programming can be both Art and Science.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And programming can give life to mathematics,</p>
          <p>it can make all those formulas start moving.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is also a very useful tool for business, or product creation,</p>
          <p>or creating things out of thin air, like a magician.</p>

          <p>While programming is a form of art,</p>
          <p>learning programming is an art too.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You learn how to learn,</p>
          <p>and you learn to spot liars that clam to teach.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>When you are learning for real at home,</p>
          <p>you get front-row seats to watch the fake education experience.</p>

          <p>Programming is really empowering,</p>
          <p>when it comes to the battle against poverty.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Something that schools do nothing about, if not downright perpetuate by charging money,</p>
          <p>and not reasonable or restrained sums, but the maximum they can get away with.</p>

          <p>Learning programming, is not about memorizing the languages,</p>
          <p>but practicing programming by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGeT8IyKd2M">creating curious little things</a> and having fun.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I always thought about programming as inventing, watchmaking, and tiny universes,</p>
          <p>but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwiln7v0fdc">Karlie Kloss calls Programming a superpower</a>, and I think her explanation is the correct one.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If I had to recommend a starting project,</p>
          <p>it would be generative art, that can be printed out on big canvas and displayed in galleries.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Programming art <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZNTozzsNqk">it is a fun way to learn about math</a>,</p>
