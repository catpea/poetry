        The software we speak of in context of Politics,
        are the Noble and Mature Minds of Human Beings.

        We can all imagine a computer with low quality workmanship,
        with misbehaving components, with overwhelmed electronics.

        This is similar to how Politics work,
        deliberately miseducated voters, overworked employees made to vote,
        can cause a Political System to misbehave.

        ---

        Let us not overburden this analogy,
        comparing Computer Systems and Political Systems,
        should just begin a conversation.

        ---

        Let us ask if we can have fully functional Justice Systems,
        when our Education and Welfare Systems have failed,
        and poverty now forces people into,
        self medication, addiction, abuse, theft, and crime.

        The answer is no.

        We cannot have a Justice System, that fully executes its orders,
        when its surrounding systems have failed,
        this creates a mechanic that was not intended,
        people are forced into a life of crime,
        and then forced into prisons.

        ---

        Let us imagine an Evil Actor,
        one that wishes to place as many people as possible in prison,
        the best way to create a mechanic that causes this,
        is to force people into poverty, deny them education, cause them stress,
        and as a result we would likely witness,
        self medication, addiction, abuse, theft, and crime, among other things.

        ---

        People are not evil, they are Noble and Dignified,
        but people can be made sick with fear, fright, hunger, cold, dankness, pain.

        When given an opportunity,
        people will take the first available exit,
        just to save themselves, it matters not it is intentional, or instinctual.

        When bad things happen,
        we take the shortest paths for maximum survival.

        ---

        A justice system that has no ability to perceive walking a path towards survival can only fill prisons.

        There may not be a way to &quot;write&quot; a &quot;software program&quot; that has the ability to perceive this complexity of life.

        ---

        But we are not helpless and brainless cogs, whose only solution is the creation of more cogs.

        ---

        We have a great power,
        the power of Shaping the Future of Our Existence.

        The name of this power is:

        Prevention.

        ---

        We can build a fully functional Justice System,
        that is Beautiful, Small, Lightweight and Simple.

        So as long as we practice, in full, Crime Prevention,
        that is, we address, in full, all the issues connected to:

        Fear, fright, hunger, cold, dankness, pain, and the resulting
        self medication, addiction, abuse, theft, to name a few.

        This list should also include issues relating to [Human Cognitive Biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases)

        ---

        Systems require that all their components are up-to-date,
        fully functional, function at their best, and at their most.

        If some part is broken, or breaking, or lacking, then all the rest will fail.

        ---

        Please, please note that Great Political Systems are often born in the Minds and Hearts of Great Beings,
        leaders, with great many followers that die for those ideas.

        No one should ever lay down their life, nor endanger the life of another, for a Leader, or an Idea,
        but this happens, because we are a growing civilization, and we want to grow.

        We have to honor all that have perished,
        all who were inspired, all who died misinformed, everyone,
        as Human Life is Beyond Sacred, and must be lived in a considerable part in Happiness.

        Mistakes happen, when civilizations grow,
        and those mistakes cause incomprehensible sadness and harm.

        ---

        We must continue moving towards a Humanity United on Good Ideas,
        so that there will be no more fighting.

        In order to Unite,
        we will need Fully Functional Political Systems across the entire globe.

        ---

        Unification is a Noble Task that the Future Generations will take great pride in.

        They need help, they need us to begin by learning more.

        By the practice of daily Acquisition of Knowledge, and Self Education.

        By our constant motion towards tipping points that will have us eventually reach Wisdom.

        By using that wisdom to Build and Support, Outstanding Political Systems.

        ---

        This is a multi-generational project,
        that may take several centuries.

        The world of the future faces great issues.

        Many of those issues are rooted in us having become tricked that we are not smart enough to learn.

        That we are not Leaders but just along for a ride.

        That the government is some kind of an external system, that only makes us do things.

        This is all just an illusion.

        ---

        Above all we are all Sisters and Brothers, we are one Family, one People.

        We are all geniuses, powerfully intelligent, though this requires life long learning, self education.

        We are all, Extremely Strong,and the strength of a Wise and United Humanity is simply indescribable.

        ---

        We don&apos;t really have a flaw,
        but we do get ill without knowledge, or when tricked into believing fantasies of falsehoods, or propaganda,
        we require healthy knowledge that helps us move towards good ideas and wisdom.

        Getting sick is not a flaw,
        it is just something that needs to be Prevented or Treated.

        The system of education was supposed to help with acquisition of knowledge,
        onward to guiding people towards becoming enlightened and wise.

        These enlightened and wise individuals,
        were to ensure an exit out of poverty and air starts for all.

        Then Justice system was to correct mistakes,
        in meaningful ways that helped Humanity Grow.

        ---

        But we are not learning,
        and all the Hopes and Dreams are being delayed,
        and some of the systems that were to come in last,
        are fully functional, spinning out of control,
        and actually causing harm, in the worst way, by tearing families apart.

        ---

        We have to balance the systems out,
        until all are fully functional.

        For example,
        we need to practice Preferential Treatment for those Fractured by Poverty,
        this is a temporary measure aimed at not sending people who did not have a fair start to prison.

        A more complex example,
        is Closing all Prisons, and replacing them with Hospitals.

        Recognizing that people get ill and that very bad people are very sick in deed,
        but that they are to be helped and not kept in cages as revenge and to cause them even more pain.

        ---

        Wisdom.

        We need a Wiser Humanity,
        we need to become more knowledgeable,
        more aware.

        We need to learn to use our financial systems to benefit Humanity,
        and keep a world hostage by means of poverty.

        These ideas may seem as outrageous today,
        as a Space Shuttle might have seemed outrageous in Dark Ages,
        as outrageous as non-existence of Ice Giants felt to the Vikings.

        ---

        Knowledge, will correct that outrage,
        Wisdom, will help Humanity Grow.

        ---

        It all begins with you,
        and your adventure into the world of Video Lectures and Audio Books.

        There is no instructor, there is no specific subject or divisions thereof,
        begin reading books that make you smile, that move you.

        For the world to grow,
        every human being must become a Connoisseur of Knowledge, and a Great Lover of Wisdom.

        By enjoying having books read to us,
        and becoming powerful with knowledge, enlightened with joy, and empowered by wisdom.

        We help the next generation to a better start,
        we help them inherit great many wisdom from us,
        and start much higher than we did.

        Let us make a Wise Humanity, or World Peace, or World United our aim,
        it matters not which,
        simply focus helping children grow faster, and wiser,
        and not forgetting the lessons we learned from the generations that came before us.

        ---

        Let us be mindful that for multiple consecutive generations to move towards the same aim,
        the aim must exceptional, permanent.

        Any nation that selects a temporary aim,
        an aim that will derail their future generations,
        will fall like a house of cards.

        That is Reality,
        that is how the Universe works.

        If the aim is not there,
        when the future generations arrive,
        they will reach nothing.

        There are no aims, other than those that are Authentic and Noble.

        We cannot help but to move towards, Reality.

        ---

        In the Future,
        no Human Being will be kept in a cage as revenge,
        for something they have done out of the fractures that poverty caused to their mind.

        In the Future,
        money will not be used to keep families overworked and stressed,
        families will have a Home, and Food, and their children will be happy, and they will grow up surrounded by wise ideas.

        In the Future,
        people will have to face the damage we have caused to our planet,
        they will see us in a forgiving light, they will see that we were not educated enough to act and to help them.

        In the Future,
