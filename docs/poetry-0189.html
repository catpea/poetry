        <section>
          <p>I&apos;ve been making web pages for ages,</p>
          <p>learning slowly in many stages.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I begun in 1999,</p>
          <p>and I am still learning new things about design.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>All the programming languages changed many times,</p>
          <p>but knowing the whole history is very useful at times.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I&apos;ve learned a lot from the command line,</p>
          <p>to art, colors, design, and how to reach the finish line.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I am surprised how long it all took,</p>
          <p>but with all I know I am sure I could write a whole book.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I still have to learn a bunch of stuff,</p>
          <p>but it is not going to be very tough.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I mostly have to get all the colors, and glows to dance and blend,</p>
          <p>I kind of left all the fun stuff for the very end.</p>
