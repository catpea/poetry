          <p>A Thousand Books is not just about becoming wise,</p>
          <p>it is also about becoming unstuck from whatever indoctrinations captured us.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>One of the terrifying aspects of indoctrination is that you can&apos;t see it at first,</p>
          <p>and society at large is not yet mature enough to separate indoctrination from personality.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>There are many people who were sent to prisons,</p>
          <p>not because of who they really are, but because they were decision-making in some creepy world.</p>

          <p>I once met an otherwise nice older person,</p>
          <p>who turned out to hate immigrants.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>When I came to Michigan,</p>
          <p>there was a scary number of high school kids believing that drugs were &quot;cool&quot;.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And back in my country, back in middle school, I was the one who was misled,</p>
          <p>I believed that bulled were a fact of life, I just didn&apos;t know to get help, I don&apos;t even tell my parents about them.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

        <div class="section">
          <p>I told my grand ma once,</p>
          <p>she immediately turned away, which was very unlike her...</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And in passing said:</p>
          <p>&quot;You&apos;re going to be OK, because you have a lion&apos;s heart.&quot;</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is probably her fault that I wear a tail for Halloween,</p>
          <p>and write poetry under Furkies Purrkies on cat pea dot com, thanks Grand Ma.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Do you see what I am saying,</p>
          <p>indoctrination is a thing, because it is invisible to those who are indoctrinated.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And can you see how easily a thousand books can help people to see themselves outside in,</p>
          <p>and how probably all of them would dig them selves out before something bad happened.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>A thousand narrated books, and in some cases, lectures and study guides that help with understanding them,</p>
          <p>would sure help the world grow, #THOUSANDBOOKSCHALLENGE</p>

          <p>I think <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAjWUrwvxs4">Ren&#xE9; Descartes</a> was the first famous philosopher to introduce the idea of warped reality,</p>
          <p>and he would push back on traditions and encourage people to think things through, similar to therapy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But today with modern technologies,</p>
          <p>our thinking can be greatly helped by narrated books.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Whatever it is that we got stuck it,</p>
          <p>it only takes a hundred books to get unstuck, and another nine-hundred, just to be safe.</p>
