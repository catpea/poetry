        <div class="section">
          <p>Above all start with a very expensive frame,</p>
          <p>and be sure to engrave your name.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Art is a very special thing,</p>
          <p>and it has little to do with coloring.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Art is a teacher of it self,</p>
          <p>and a school without a single bookshelf.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You can start with anything,</p>
          <p>so as long as it is lasting.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>There may just be but a single rule in art,</p>
          <p>and if you follow it, it will make you smart.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Never do anything temporary,</p>
          <p>in the end your art must fill a library.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>As to where to start,</p>
          <p>it depends on your art.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If I had to recommend something to get you into the zone,</p>
          <p>I&apos;d say get a hammer and find a huge glacial stone.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Just look at at it and let the shape speak,</p>
          <p>and then shape it for a whole week.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Make it funny, and sad, and wise, and profound,</p>
          <p>and just leave it there until it is found.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>So as long as you make it last,</p>
          <p>it will permanently grace your beautiful past.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You are not just learning art,</p>
          <p>you are also helping the world become smart.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And if you can&apos;t come up with a shape,</p>
          <p>then make it into a large grape...</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We&apos;ll call this one the Earth, and it will mark the birth...</p>
          <p>of the greatest art project on Earth.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The next little rock you will need,</p>
          <p>we&apos;ll name Mars, and you will have to drive far, in deed.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And your art will need to connect and fast,</p>
          <p>because you are also telling a story of your past.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>People will expect to see the beginning, the middle and the end,</p>
          <p>and they will wait to see what wisdom you will recommend.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Temporary art is no good,</p>
          <p>it must last and we must be understood.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>My goodness there is so much to say,</p>
          <p>so much wisdom to convey.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This is why it must be set in stone,</p>
          <p>so that it is never gone.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>May all your artworks be as loved as they are clever,</p>
          <p>and may each and every one of them last forever.</p>
