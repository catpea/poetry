          <p>In today&apos;s episode,</p>
          <p>we get mad at High School and Music.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We use songs as an example of a thing...</p>
          <p>that the first semester of music class should teach you how to make.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I want you to think about a website, with an album of 10 songs,</p>
          <p>that your customers can buy, or license from you for their business use.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Music is simple, elevator music is so simple it is automatically generated,</p>
          <p>so is brainless video music that plays in the background.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Underwhelming workout music, that people kind of prefer,</p>
          <p>is little more than background music.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>So, from now on when you hear brainless music, void of soul and love,</p>
          <p>get mad, at your teacher and say:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>&quot;Don&apos;t waste my time, don&apos;t make me memorize.&quot;,</p>
          <p>if you want to teach, teach me something complete and useful, wrapped in a small business.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>When they kick you out of class for being disruptive,</p>
          <p>stay mad, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KhwjboHHWw">babble something madly and awkwardly</a> under your nose, don&apos;t give up.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If the world governments really believed that you were the future of their nation,</p>
          <p>they wouldn&apos;t be putting you in debt for higher education.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If teachers were really interested in nobly educating you out of their goodness,</p>
          <p>they would have never <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cv-60ZA-PnM">allowed book publishers to cheat you</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If schools were on your side,</p>
          <p>student debt would never have existed in the first place.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Student debt forgiveness is not enough,</p>
          <p>a school that charges money has a conflict of interest, it will simply educate less and aim to profit more.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Get mad, you can always go back to school,</p>
          <p>but you will not always have an opportunity to focus all your attention on some amazing experiment.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I mention music because it is everywhere,</p>
          <p>and if music class really did teach music, we would all be able to create songs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is just Drums,</p>
          <p>Bass, Chords, and Melodies.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Music Theory is not difficult either when taught right,</p>
          <p>with simple emphasis on the Circle of Fifths and focus on examples in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrMTlpeSw8Y">lmms</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If schools really cared to help you,</p>
          <p>they would help you find and fund a path towards a small business.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Such as the creating of workout music,</p>
          <p>and sale of workout programs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>At the end of the first year of high school,</p>
          <p>you would not be getting a grade, but your first business.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And you would experience making your first $100,</p>
          <p>the next year you would have a second, and third and fourth.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Some of your best customers,</p>
          <p>would be kids from your school.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Music is really useful when creating videos, documentaries,</p>
          <p>workouts, commercials, presentations, you name it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Because you are right there,</p>
          <p>they would be licensing lots of material from you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And this would continue on,</p>
          <p>and the word would spread, your little company would reliably make a little bit of money.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Get mad, because your time is precious,</p>
          <p>and nobody should take advantage of your inexperience, by acting high and mighty, all the while <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9M4tdMsg3ts">selling you out for a small paycheck</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Get mad, because you deserve a real and functional education,</p>
          <p>that enhances your predispositions, not cookie cutter classes that attack you for having unique interests.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We all face poverty, and we are given this idea of going to college and making money,</p>
          <p>but college took upon it self to actually puts us in debt, shove us into the minus.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And allow others to nibble some more,</p>
          <p>&quot;a debt that cannot be removed with bankruptcy&quot;, &quot;a predatory textbook business model&quot; - are you kidding me?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Get mad, because you are being handed lemons,</p>
          <p>and forced to drink the lemonade, that the school convinces you, that only they can teach you how to make.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is time to stop pretending to learn by cramming for tests and memorizing material,</p>
          <p>and time to start asking questions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And what is this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5uqNhfNHL8">grade and GPA nonsense</a>?</p>
          <p>grades are not real just for the fact that tests can be crammed for, they only reflect forgotten memories.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Even the Dean&apos;s List seems like a scam when you have to pay for lectures,</p>
          <p>it just gets the students to play the charade some more.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Music class, to give you a simple example,</p>
          <p>must enable every student to make music.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>On the final day of the first semester,</p>
          <p>everyone needs to know how to make songs with lmms.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is that simple, music class teaches you to make music,</p>
          <p>if you can&apos;t make an album of songs, then you just got tricked.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Your time is precious and is not to be wasted, and let me tell you something,</p>
          <p>get mad, because the teacher sure took a bunch of money home for pretending to teach you.</p>
