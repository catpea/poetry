          <p>&quot;Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions,</p>
          <p>binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs.</p>
          <p>Books break the shackles of time.</p>
          <p>A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic.&quot;</p>

          <p>Don&apos;t worry, if you want something ever lasting,</p>
          <p>just create it.</p>

          <p>You can&apos;t just make a doodle and hope it will last forever,</p>
          <p>you have to be deliberate about it.</p>

          <p>It can be almost anything,</p>
          <p>one beautiful example is the teachings of Socrates.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Socrates, never wrote a book,</p>
          <p>all the books are written about him.</p>

          <p>Leonardo, the inventor,</p>
          <p>not the turtle.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Is till admired for his creations,</p>

          <p>To make something last,</p>
          <p>you have use things that can stand the test of time.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Poetry, personal poetry,</p>
          <p>descriptive poetry that descries an era, is another great example.</p>

          <p>though they maybe hard to chisel, get right to the point.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Make it meaningful, beautiful, and time-proof,</p>
          <p>and someone will protect it for you - probably out of beauty and admiration, too.</p>

          <p>A journal may perish, unfortunate,</p>
          <p>but if you start HUGE (as in 11 x 14 Inches), and fill it with a thousand doodles, and little photos of where you live.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And take pictures of every page and turn it into a thick-ish pocket book,</p>
          <p>I bet people will love to carry it around, just out of how tiny, delicate, and high resolution your imagination is.</p>

          <p>This is where things get tricky,</p>
          <p>because if you have a thought, that captures your spirit, then your spirit will become entangled in your work of art.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Just like the Spirits of Socrates, of Leonardo,</p>
          <p>are entangled in their achievements.</p>

          <p>My spirit-entangling thought, at the time of this writing is,</p>
          <p>&quot;You are meant to become a great being.&quot;.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>These words are meant to be heard by every Human Being,</p>
          <p>today, and hence forth.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is my almost secret plan,</p>
          <p>to help the world grow.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I care not for any one person becoming superhuman,</p>
          <p>but for each and every one of us, to realize we are _not_ an ordinary creature.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is neither too late,</p>
          <p>not too early for this.</p>

          <p>We can all get good at anything that moves us,</p>
          <p>we can all invent countless new things to no end.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And by using books, especially narrated books,</p>
          <p>we can all transport our spirits across the vastness of time.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This is not a description of an ordinary creature,</p>
          <p>this is the magic and superpowers we day-dream about in fantasies and cartoons.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We invented superheroes, we invented thousands of Goddesses and Gods,</p>
          <p>and we did it to lift each other to become their best projections.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We created a network of bookmarks,</p>
          <p>and a universe of reminders.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We have to quickly learn to hop up to the top,</p>
          <p>and continue rising higher and higher, until we transcend what we though our limits were.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And don&apos;t worry,</p>
          <p>our limits are neither our faults nor boundaries.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>They are just leftovers from that adaptive system of evolution,</p>
          <p>that hoisted us above the other animals.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We have 2,154 to 3,159 tigers left,</p>
          <p>set dark imaginings aside, but let us not delay our growing up any further.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>There are too many good actors getting their kicks out of pretending to be who they are not,</p>
          <p>and each and everyone of them holds the world back.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And learn from them, learn from their quotes, and paper and narrated books,</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If they don&apos;t quite fit you,</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And then find the second one,</p>
          <p>take all their lessons add them together and make the union of the two your own.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Tell your teacher that they are not good enough for you,</p>
          <p>that you know they are there to get paid, and it is time you get a real education from real teachers.</p>

          <p>I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately,</p>

          <p>and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I did not wish to live what was not life,</p>

          <p>nor did I wish to practise resignation,</p>

          <p>I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life,</p>
          <p>to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life,</p>
          <p>to cut a broad swath and shave close,</p>
          <p>to drive life into a corner,</p>
          <p>and reduce it</p>
