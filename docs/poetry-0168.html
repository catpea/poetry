          <p>I took a little nap,</p>
          <p>As I had to finish a website and an app.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I woke up feeling sweet and mighty and very strong.</p>
          <p>even though I really didn&apos;t sleep for very long.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Now I have to get ready to go back to real sleep,</p>
          <p>and I hope I don&apos;t end up having to count sheep.</p>

          <p>I&apos;ve been learning programming and design all on my own,</p>
          <p>my software is really good now, I have progressed and grown.</p>

          <p>There are no shortcuts to becoming really good,</p>
          <p>there is no school that can teach us as they should.</p>

          <p>Talking matters in your own hands is the best way,</p>
          <p>the difference is like night and day.</p>

          <p>For decades I&apos;ve telling people,</p>
          <p>our mind are really, really, really delicate and extremely intricate.</p>

          <p>Wherever possible we have to take to the books,</p>
          <p>go on tiny adventures and explore all the crannies and nooks.</p>

        <section>
          <p>To start learning well, find something pretty,</p>
          <p>real education is like exploring a new city.</p>

          <p>You don&apos;t start by memorizing a map,</p>
          <p>you just go from one place to another, until you need a nap.</p>

          <p>The teacher has no idea who you are or what you know,</p>
          <p>if you&apos;ll listen to them you&apos;ll never grow.</p>

        <section>
          <p>Organized education is like a trap,</p>
          <p>learn on your own, and don&apos;t forget to take a nap.</p>
