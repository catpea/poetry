          <p>I saw someone trying their wobbly luck.</p>

          <p>While I am certain, they didn&apos;t get very far,</p>

          <p>You don&apos;t have to go all the way,</p>
          <p>just far enough...</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>To get the motorists wandering,</p>

          <p>I recommend a fat tire bicycle,</p>
          <p>a thermos with tea and some sweet biscuits, coconut perhaps?</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You will need, two sets of clothes,</p>
          <p>and you need to wear them both at once.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Gloves, thick furry, fluffy,</p>
          <p>impervious to adventurer winds gloves, very important.</p>

          <p>And something to cover your face,</p>
          <p>one way or another it will get cold.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Hopefully, you will ride on a sunny day,</p>
          <p>and of course, you will need an audio book.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Perhaps you could find something about the Appalachian Tail,</p>
          <p>be careful with books about expeditions to the poles, as someone always gets in horrible trouble.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And be sure to have a tire repair kit,</p>
          <p>just in case.</p>

          <p>You will have to take plenty of pictures,</p>
          <p>they always come out very beautifully.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And, if you find any downed trees,</p>
          <p>being the Trail Blazer that you are...</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If the tree is small enough,</p>
          <p>you&apos;re going to have to make a trip to a hardware store.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Find the sharpest saw,</p>
          <p>and get the tree off the trail, if you can.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I fixed one of the downed trees after a particularly heavy rain,</p>
          <p>and I still smile to this day, as I proudly pass by the stump I made.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It will feel like an expedition,</p>
          <p>snow makes everything seem more distant.</p>

          <hr>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Oh, and be careful about the frozen ice,</p>
          <p>that may hide beneath snow from time to time.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is one of my most fantastic memories of the trail,</p>
          <p>when my front tire, simply slid from beneath my bike and I landed with a snowy thud.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Confused.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I could feel several motorists think to themselves,</p>
          <p>&quot;the dumb ass just fell&quot;.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

        <div class="section">
          <p>But I cared not,</p>
          <p>for I was in the middle of a rough expedition.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Don&apos;t feel bad if you just day dream about it,</p>
          <p>that is pretty good too, plus, it is always a plus if you don&apos;t have to pedal in cold winds.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But if you do go for it,</p>
          <p>I hope you will blaze that trail, and many others, every year, from now on.</p>
