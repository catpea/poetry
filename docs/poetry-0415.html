          <p>Unfortunately :)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You don&apos;t have to tell anyone about it,</p>
          <p>just do it on the side to relax, without taking it too seriously.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Buy yourself a beautiful keyboard,</p>
          <p>maybe a mechanical keyboard with funny keys.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And get the 8GB Raspberry PI CanaKit for $150,</p>
          <p>and one or two $90 monitors.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izOhCUdLv2s">Install node.js</a>,</p>
          <p>maybe install xscreensaver, and turn on the XMatrix screensaver.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And take a break, set it up all nice and beautiful...</p>
          <p>and let the damn thing haunt you from the corner of your house.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

        <div class="section">
          <p>The programming language you will be learning is JavaScript,</p>
          <p>it is the most popular programming language, it will be here for many decades.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And the first thing it to create your hello-world.js,</p>
          <p>that just contains console.log(&apos;Hello World!&apos;);</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Then, make it executable with chmod +x hello-world.js;</p>
          <p>and watch it print Hello World, in your Linux terminal.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In terms of knowledge, this will be more powerful,</p>
          <p>than your entire high-school education.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Hello World,</p>
          <p>that is your foot into programming.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Grad a book, about programming JavaScript,</p>
          <p>or programming node, and learn about functions(){} and for() loops.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And type up some example code,</p>
          <p>just relax.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Later, you will need to get used to github,</p>
          <p>the web is full of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv8rSLsi1xo">github tutorials</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Github represents your resume,</p>
          <p>you want to have between a hundred and a thousand programs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>They all have to be little,</p>
          <p>little gems, like you can find on <a href="http://microjs.com/">microjs.com</a></p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Make sure to create a test.js with every one of your programs,</p>
          <p>so that you can throw a bunch of stuff at your program to see if everything works.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And use the <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#packages_type">type: &apos;module&apos; in your package.json</a>,</p>
          <p>this way you can use the modern JavaScript imports, instead of require statements.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And again keep it all small,</p>
          <p>small and perfect.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You can create servers,</p>
          <p>that you can explore with your browser.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You can create command line utilities,</p>
          <p>that you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHDhaSSKmB0">publish to npm</a>, and then install on any computer with node.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The whole <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rmj5UY5mJk">npm thing is just a directory of public programs and libraries</a>,</p>
          <p>it goes really well with github, especially when it comes to quality of your resume.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Try to create text games, wikis, little Linux programs that help you analyze text,</p>
          <p>spend some time using different APIs to automate YouTube or make your toaster Tweet nonsense.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is all just fun,</p>
          <p>it is really cool.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Once you have a lot of programs, maybe just 30, 100 maybe too much, and 1,000 is just weird,</p>
          <p>then view your github as your resume.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It won&apos;t take too much more to get a job as a programmer,</p>
          <p>maybe some certification, though only if you like that kind of thing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is really fun to take classes about thing that you have already mastered,</p>
          <p>it is very relaxing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Then brush up on weird parts of JavaScript by looking at,</p>
          <p><a href="https://github.com/DopplerHQ/awesome-interview-questions#javascript">JavaScript interview questions</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And then, people will start paying you for playing with computers,</p>
          <p>it is an amazing experience.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Just you know keep it short,</p>
          <p>you will have to build your own company, you can&apos;t just work for somebody else.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And then change the world,</p>
          <p>everything that you will do here, from your first cool keyboard onward, will reinforce your unique mind.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Learning programming, is a very narrow and straight road,</p>
          <p>day after day, you just continuously increase in power.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>There are no forks in the road,</p>
          <p>no stupid test, and the knowledge you internalize is always appreciated.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Finally, your elder self will never seriously say,</p>
          <p>&quot;Oh, my gosh lyke, why am I a programmer? - what the hell was I thinking?&quot;</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You&apos;ll say it plenty of times as a cheerful joke though,</p>
          <p>programming is really cool, even if you just do it for fun, it is like the ultimate form of meditation and entertainment.</p>
