          <p>Falsehoods,</p>
          <p>are mind killers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Falsehoods limit us, they divide us,</p>
          <p>they poison Humanity.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>People who believe in falsehoods,</p>
          <p>are prevented from growing up.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>As scary as that is,</p>
          <p>we also have everything it takes to remove them from our minds.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In deed, there is scarcely a place out there that will preach truth,</p>
          <p>even a proper University will rely on the scholar to find the reproducible result.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Removing falsehoods,</p>
          <p>is a healthy, and mighty, part of growing up.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Books that are held in high esteem by the wise and intellectual,</p>
          <p>will hasten and balance the process discovering truths.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>A book, or a narrated book, that shares true wisdom,</p>
          <p>is a briefcase of good ideas, and treasures for our minds (or upgrades if you are technologically inclined).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Without books, we would be struck by the urge to visit Universities, and lecture halls,</p>
          <p>and to write to those who have things to say, which is what would cause them to share wisdom or letters in books.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Many people need to hear a book,</p>
          <p>and it truly a beautiful experience to hear a book read by its author.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Equipped with a couple of hundred narrated books,</p>
          <p>you can easily inherit lifetimes of knowledge and experience.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Falsehoods are harder, and take longer to get rid of than you think,</p>
          <p>as they often embedded in, and obscured by, our lifestyles, family culture, neighborhood culture, and even national culture.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But there is a sure cure for that,</p>
          <p>a very noble tradition, practiced by humans probably for tens of thousands of years.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In Modern Day, that is the act of buying a backpack, and bug spray, and strangely overpriced pants and shoes,</p>
          <p>and a tent, or a hammock tent, and reconnecting with nature on long and winding trails.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Quests, that require a lot of walking,</p>
          <p>that pull you out of your environment, and give you a healthy substitute for a prolonged period of time.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Think about how your mind changes when you go on a vacation,</p>
          <p>how you become more contemplative, relaxed, and become more of yourself.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Know, that,</p>
          <p>that is the real you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>When your mind is rested and unstressed</p>
          <p>it is most receptive to growth, to growing up, to being Human.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Many people start reading books on their vacations,</p>
          <p>that is because reaching out for knowledge about or wisdom from other lives, is a very natural thing for us.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The power of falsehoods,</p>
          <p>is too often impossibly overwhelming.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Talking about it and thinking about it is not enough,</p>
          <p>when falsehoods grab a hold of us, we too often point ourselves away from the right way, and make things worse.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Falsehoods can stress us to self medicate with overeating,</p>
          <p>they have the power to make ourselves ill.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Falsehoods like the belief that out poverty is our fault,</p>
          <p>can press us into a job where we never read a book, and never take to wisdom.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In conclusion of this text,</p>
          <p>I must ask you to make a powerful change.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I have to ask you,</p>
          <p>to go on a marvelous shopping expedition for camping gear, and go on a long and deeply relaxing vacation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And never return to the mindset that you left behind when you set off for that quest,</p>
          <p>you must use your power to live your life in the state of mind brought on by a vacation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Know that whatever troubles you left behind as you went on your vacation,</p>
          <p>have always been holding you back and are preventing you from growing up.</p>
        </div>

          <p>You are a Noble and Beautiful Human Being,</p>
          <p>you are mean to grow, to reach for Knowledge, Wisdom and Greatness.</p>
