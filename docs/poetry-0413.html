          <p>I know this sounds like basic advice,</p>
          <p>but this is tough.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>School was double trouble for me,</p>
          <p>not only was it nonsense, but it also came with bullies.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It was dangerous, so I stopped going,</p>
          <p>it never occurred to me to call the police.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I thought everyone was getting bullied,</p>
          <p>I didn&apos;t even complain to the school.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I didn&apos;t complain about my bad grades in programming,</p>
          <p>the teacher marked me down because he got angry that I was copying.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It never occurred to me to go to the principal,</p>
          <p>the bullies were already laughing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>There was this short kid getting beaten up,</p>
          <p>and I tried to push away his bully.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Who was an A student,</p>
          <p>and an addict.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Not only did the two turn on me,</p>
          <p>but my main bully joined in two.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I don&apos;t fight,</p>
          <p>because that would only make me a bully.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But, when I am in danger,</p>
          <p>everyone is going to be pushed away.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The fight came to an abrupt end,</p>
          <p>as my bully was already hurt, probably from his father.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>SO the teachers got around,</p>
          <p>for the first time in five years bullying was noticed.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Except that when I got back to my classroom,</p>
          <p>the smartest of the girls, told me that they don&apos;t want me there anymore.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Just about at the same moment,</p>
          <p>the school shrink came in, put her hand on my shoulder and said everything is OK.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The two that originally started the fight,</p>
          <p>begun lying that I started the fight.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I told the psychologist to grill them until they start telling the truth,</p>
          <p>and she finally got the real story out of them.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And they got punished,</p>
          <p>I didn&apos;t do anything wrong other than pushing my bullies away.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Each of them, including the little one tried to fight me before,</p>
          <p>I still didn&apos;t want the little guy to get beaten up, I know what it is like.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Few days later, my main bully, invited college kids to teach me a lesson,</p>
          <p>they actually came into to the school.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I did not see the kick,</p>
          <p>he must have been standing behind me.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I didn&apos;t really get hurt,</p>
          <p>but I stayed on the ground to be safe.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The Russian language teacher saw me down,</p>
          <p>and didn&apos;t do anything.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>When I made it to class,</p>
          <p>the bully that invited the older boys to teach me a lesson, was laughing at me.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I think the side of my face was red from the kick,</p>
          <p>they would have been arrested if I knew to call the police.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I am certain they had knives,</p>
          <p>there were four to six of them, they had look outs by the stairs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>My main bully was lying that I was beating him up,</p>
          <p>it was either because his father was abusing him.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Or because his father was teaching him to shit on other people,</p>
          <p>he was telling his kid how to destroy me.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Since I assumed this always happens to everyone,</p>
          <p>I was fine, a little lonely.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>After the big bullies came,</p>
          <p>it was dangerous to go back to school.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>So I went the other way,</p>
          <p>wisely.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I saw my main bully watching me,</p>
          <p>waiting for the buss that goes the other way.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>They were jealous, they laughed,</p>
          <p>who knows.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Th first time I crossed the street to wait for the bus that goes the other way,</p>
          <p>meant I dropped out of school.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>My parents were already angry for me pushing bullies away,</p>
          <p>after five years of taking their punches, but I didn&apos;t care.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I was not a victim,</p>
          <p>I was a warrior.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I won every one of those fights,</p>
          <p>by not hurting them back.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Each time they came to attack me,</p>
          <p>I became stronger, nobler, more powerful, smarter, more independent.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Isolation didn&apos;t hurt me either,</p>
          <p>all I ever knew was bullying, and being alone, I used to enjoy it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I had a Commodore 64, and I used Simon&apos;s Basic to teach myself about pixels,</p>
          <p>I never liked playing computer games, I still don&apos;t.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But, I kept current, with every major game release,</p>
          <p>I carefully paid attention, to the pixels.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McXJj7sjcZ0">Souls games</a> are my favorite, of course,</p>
          <p>never payed them but they are each a masterpiece.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>That where the buss took me,</p>
          <p>it took me into the world of Pixel Art.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It was an old underground World War 2 bunker,</p>
          <p>that was filled with Arcade Games.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If I didn&apos;t go back to school,</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFqBkSJOYOQ">I would have been coding my own intros, I would have become part of the demo scene</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I would have mastered it all,</p>
          <p>but I went back, but it took the teachers four months to catch on that I was gone.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Four amazing months,</p>
          <p>I never had the money to play games, I would only watch others play it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>My favorites were <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LhEovW4Uqw">Asterix</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9DE-KyZnLc">The Simpsons</a> by Konami,</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Even after I graduated that strange place,</p>
          <p>and went to a much nicer school bullies were there.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The older they get the creeper they become,</p>
          <p>one kid actually freaked out, as I didn&apos;t pull my hand away, I bet he still remembers that smell.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The biggest bully there, that seemed like a normal person,</p>
          <p>was actually a neo nazi, I wasn&apos;t scared but I kept my distance.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It was time to pack by that time,</p>
          <p>I ended up in Brooklyn, NY.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And again, as I was waking back from school,</p>
          <p>the local boxer kid, started punching me in the back of my head.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Brooklyn was my home though,</p>
          <p>I called the police, I told them I would not press charges.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>While they said they couldn&apos;t do anything,</p>
          <p>they were all gone.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Before I moved to the state I am in now,</p>
          <p>the bully walked by me and using the F word explained that he does not like Poles, as in polish people.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I was too scared to say anything,</p>
          <p>but most of the polish people I knew were very cruel to me.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I always tried to make friends,</p>
          <p>but, it was difficult.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The part of me that made me win every fight without fighting,</p>
          <p>by being strong, and dignified.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Is not comfortable around people that do alcohol, drugs,</p>
          <p>that go to bars, and live in that creepy culture of get plastered, get stoned, get laid, get wasted, lie, cheat, and steal.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I became strong, not by running away from fights,</p>
          <p>but by not punching back, by taking the hardest path, and the easy roads are just not for me, they are frightening.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I tried to help many people in my journeys,</p>
          <p>but help must come from within.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>One time I mumbled something about helping people a decade back, at a Chinese restaurant near by,</p>
          <p>and a lady almost yelled at me &quot;That is not your problem, not your responsibility.&quot;</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I admitted to her &quot;I know that now.&quot;,</p>
          <p>but before I thought we had to help each other.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I never really helped anyone get out of any trouble,</p>
          <p>I think it was because I didn&apos;t look like a wise old man.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Nobody was listening to me,</p>
          <p>but I tried!</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>My big advice, is to remember the Dean, the principal, the police,</p>
          <p>don&apos;t let anybody push you around.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If you get an unfair grade,</p>
          <p>don&apos;t just stand there like I did - go to the principal, and make yourself at home.</p>

          <p>If you are too scared to speak, say so,</p>
          <p>&quot;I have trouble speaking because I am scared, please give me a moment to gather my thoughts.&quot;</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If bullies come after you, you have to call the police, to help them,</p>
          <p>the police needs to investigate their parents.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>No child is born a bully, the worst of them are victims of abuse, if you get the police on it early,</p>
