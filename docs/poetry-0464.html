          <p>Real Education and Cultural Convergence is one sure way towards World Peace,</p>
          <p>it requires that all the cultures of the Human Kind grow.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In order to make headway in this exhausting and near impossible Dream,</p>
          <p>we have to stop making decisions in the now, and begin thinking in terms of generations.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>To think in terms of generations,</p>
          <p>is to build real educational institutions that make a real positive difference.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>An educational institution that makes a real positive difference,</p>
          <p>provides its students - not with a self serving system of grades - but several independent student made businesses at graduation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is the creation of these businesses,</p>
          <p>that will determine what topics of interest the student will reach out for.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In a very small, and restrained part,</p>
          <p>the existence of these powerful international institutions is funded by a small temporary percentage of the student earnings.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Unlike today Universities, these institutions are open to all,</p>
          <p>they only take enough money to stay in business.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And they server billions of students,</p>
          <p>with the express purpose of Noble and Dignified Betterment of Human Kind.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>No student will ever be expelled,</p>
          <p>there will be no grades, no punishment, no records of wrong doing, only successful graduation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

        <div class="section">
          <p>Heartbreakingly, our civilization has not yet progressed far enough,</p>
          <p>to successfully build these Loving Gigantic Institutions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Humanity is not yet ready to recognize the importance,</p>
          <p>not get it right, as the project would be plagued with liars, pretenders, and failures; hoping for breadcrumbs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Today, more effort would go into protecting these institutions from liars,</p>
          <p>then helping the students transcend their limitations.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Without getting too much into it, as there is too much to waste our time,</p>
          <p>from a very important perspective, heartbreakingly, it is illegal... under US constitution, to provide _all_ children, with universal education.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court affirmed that,</p>
          <p>&quot;the benefits of universal education do not justify a violation of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.&quot;</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Which reads,</p>
          <p>&quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof...&quot;</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Our civilization, is not yet ready to embrace real education,</p>
          <p>these international institutions would fail to secure stable initial funding.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And with heir importance misperceived as an attack on nationalism, or the spreading of globalism, or some other **** fairy tale,</p>
          <p>they would be gutted, and taxed, and lose the meaningless and corrupt status of accreditation, and used as an example of what not to do.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Our civilization is not ready to learn,</p>
          <p>the hateful and arrogant politicians we elect show us how far behind on good ideas we truly are.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The way education works today,</p>
          <p>creates a very uneven, luck based, dishonest and inauthentic, and in some cases hostile, surface for all the future generations.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Organized education can&apos;t yet work,</p>
          <p>but there is a way around this, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVV2Zk88beY">a path of self education that has already been followed countess times before</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>A way that revolves around encouraging all people all around the world,</p>
          <p>to accept the responsibility for their own education.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This is also the way that will helps them attack poverty by becoming business people,</p>
          <p>and it also serves as a way to clear the land for laying down foundations of the real schools.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

        <div class="section">
          <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmoor8DwqW4">Schools of today are not teaching us</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0waOz8RYxFE">they have failed us</a>,</p>
          <p>and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxyKNMrhEvY">we are being cheated out of important knowledge and wisdom</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>As many of you have realized by now,</p>
          <p>we have not, in fact received a real education, it was a m,make believe education.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Just hard enough to make you feel that you were working hard,</p>
          <p>and that your hard won diploma, would lead you out of poverty and towards a beautiful future.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The people that you thought were smarter then you, were not actually smarter than you,</p>
          <p>they were self-educating independently of the useless materials in school.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The people that became successful, became successful not because of luck,</p>
          <p>but because they accepted the responsibility for their own education.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Luck. is easy come,</p>
          <p>easy go, it doesn&apos;t stick around like Wisdom.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>People are confused about what education is,</p>
          <p>they think books, Doctors, and Dentists, but those are just their boring jobs, that were a fun challenge to learn for.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Real education, is about Knowledge inherited from countless lives found in powerful books,</p>
          <p>Wisdom gained from living what is life.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And above greatness,</p>
          <p>Greatness.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Greatness of Restraint, Greatness of Dignity, Greatness of Nobility, Greatness of Unbreakability, Greatness of Fortitude, Greatness of Courage, Greatness of Honor, Greatness of Love;</p>
          <p>and Greatness of Insight; and Greatness of Foresight; and Greatness of Understanding; and Greatness of Authenticity, and Greatness of Heroism; and, then some.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPSvdKTEZug">Greatness</a> is not difficult, it is what Human are meant for,</p>
          <p>but it is deliberate, it requires sustained everyday urge to better yourself.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The Wold Schools that I describe,</p>
          <p>will bring World Peace, simply by making Humanity Wise.</p>
