          <p>And when the stars and the moon came out,</p>

          <p>Never have I been more lonely,</p>
          <p>and never closer to Thoreau, Melville, Whitman and Defoe.</p>

          <p>That&apos;s where I found my ancient copy of Robinson Crusoe,</p>
          <p>and I&apos;d read it from time to mime, I&apos;d listen to it as an Audio Book as well.</p>

          <p>I found Dan Millman&apos;s Peacefull Warrior,</p>
          <p>on a bottom shelf in a Dusty Box,</p>
          <p>I read it from cover to cover in a single afternoon.</p>

          <p>I was a Wizard of the Woods once - &quot;Thou shall pass&quot;,</p>
          <p>I&apos;d holler stepping out of the way on that steep part of the Arrowhead trail.</p>

          <p>Another year I was the Artsy Hobo, I built Driftwood Horses,</p>
          <p>and adorn whatever I couldn&apos;t lift with colorful cats.</p>
          <p>- I used up all my acrylics.</p>

          <p>And early on I was the Raccoon Artist,</p>
          <p>I&apos;d trace and sketch huge drawings of raccoons,</p>
          <p>they were but a step away from becoming photo-realistic.</p>

          <p>I was greeted by a tired Park Ranger that didn&apos;t say a word.</p>

          <p>There was a couple of big storms,</p>
          <p>that&apos;s true.</p>

          <p>I remember laying on the ground in my tent, with an angry storm outside,</p>
          <p>listing to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGK84Poeynk">We Are All Connected, by Symphony of Science</a>,</p>
          <p>and wondering about the conductivity of my tent poles.</p>
