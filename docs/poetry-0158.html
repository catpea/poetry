          <p>Before we learn what we should know,</p>
          <p>we must first learn how to grow.</p>

        <section>
          <p>To break out of all the rooms and halls,</p>
          <p>we must destroy all the invisible walls.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>As we cannot reason-about what we can&#x2019;t see,</p>
          <p>and so we must surpass our limits before we can think free.</p>

        <section>
          <p>It is not so much moving forward,</p>
          <p>as it is always growing upward.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>We say forward when we seem to stop,</p>
          <p>but we mean up - up to the top.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And then rise above where our limits once stood,</p>
          <p>from could to would, to finally should.</p>

        <section>
          <p>What once we saw as highest complexity,</p>
          <p>we will know to navigate like a small city.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Then, we can help people finish their thoughts,</p>
          <p>help them to their stars, connect their dots.</p>

        <section>
          <p>We must learn, it is just how Human Beings are,</p>
          <p>we have to see the whole before we can find the star.</p>
