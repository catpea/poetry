          <p>That is all you get to save the world with,</p>
          <p>if it was easy somebody else would have done it already.</p>

          <p>Next time you&apos;re in class, look at the back row,</p>
          <p>one of them is a genius who does not believe in the world anymore, the rest need help, the sooner the better.</p>

          <p>All around the world, liars stretch accepted patterns they hardly understand, like a bubble gum, and with perfect deniability,</p>
          <p>there is no blame, there is no proof, there are no laws that could help here, nothing can be done to fix anything.</p>

          <p>But also nothing that Humanity needs,</p>

          <p>The state of things as we see today,</p>
          <p>can be prevented from re-occurring come next-generation by means of real education, and prevention of emergence of desperate creatures that become perfect liars.</p>

          <p>The same goes for criminals,</p>
          <p>the idea of stealing an ATM to become free comes from little more than Saturday morning cartoons and desperation.</p>

          <p>With real politics and wise politicians, we will see Universal Basic Income come into reality,</p>
          <p>and nobody is going to rob anything if they already have the money and live a life of Knowledge, Authenticity, and Dignity.</p>

          <p>As unbelievable as it sounds, Prevention coupled with Real Education,</p>
          <p>that guides people towards Knowledge, Wisdom and Greatness, is where Humanity will find its future.</p>

        <section>
          <p>Once liars take to power, we can only wait for them to retire,</p>
          <p>and while we are waiting we have to help children grow so that they will become the Great Beings that will may their place.</p>
