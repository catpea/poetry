          <p>You have to breathe,</p>
          <p>like a song.</p>

          <p>How are you, like everybody else,</p>
          <p>when you are so unique that there is no way to replace you.</p>

          <p>If a teacher is not teaching, or if a parent is indifferent,</p>
          <p>or if you are asked to lay down your life for a belief that only lines the pockets of whoever is asking.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is hard to understand the importance of a life changing book,</p>
          <p>before you actually find it, before it moves you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But you have to,</p>
          <p>you have to search for books that will change your life for better.</p>
