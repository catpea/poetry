          <p>Each day we must learn,</p>
          <p>and what we&apos;ve forgotten re-lean.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Our life depends on clarity,</p>
          <p>our visions must be sharp.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>A lesson learned, begets a wisdom.</p>
          <p>Two create a kingdom.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Our might comes from knowledge,</p>
          <p>and you can&apos;t find that in college.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Life is too short to lean in slices,</p>
          <p>leave them to their own devices.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>You are a powerful being,</p>
          <p>you learn fastest on your own.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>As few teachers there are,</p>
          <p>so there are but a handful of books.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>It will be hard work,</p>
          <p>to fill all the notebooks.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>But your mind is unique, anyway,</p>
          <p>there is no substitute for your own way.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>At first it will be gibberish,</p>
          <p>at last, they will read it feverish.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>You must not be tired,</p>
          <p>your mind cannot be stressed.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>You must resist what they desired,</p>
          <p>tell them you can&apos;t be hired.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>You are not a dime a dozen,</p>
          <p>there is no other like you.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>You have to tend to your mind,</p>
          <p>all the forgotten lessons remind.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>There cannot be anyone like you,</p>
          <p>learn to reach your own breakthrough.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Set your self free from the silly sting,</p>
          <p>you are not just a little thing.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>No retreat, no surrender.</p>
          <p>You are a meant to become a Great Being.</p>
