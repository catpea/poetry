          <p>Humanity must not be scared of poverty,</p>
          <p>poverty is just a symptom of immature, shortsighted politics.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>For politics to grow up and begin helping the world heal,</p>
          <p><strong>we</strong> must begin growing up, and inspire the children to growing up as well.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Nothing will change, nothing can change,</p>
          <p>unless we begin our lives by resuming where great beings left off.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>There is just one road for all to agree,</p>
          <p>the road of Reality, Results, Knowledge, Wisdom, Excellence, and Good Ideas.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>We receive a very good impression of the meaning of Wisdom when we are children,</p>
          <p>we think of Adults as all-knowing, as always correct, and perfect.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>This is our aim now, for in the absence of teachers we must become the teachers,</p>
          <p>we must become the adults we wished we grew up with.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>This is how we make the World better,</p>
          <p>for our generation, and moreso for the new generation, and all those yet to come.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>We can&apos;t hope for change,</p>
          <p>and not grow to meet that demand ourselves.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>The change we need,</p>
          <p>is driven by Permanent Inheritance of Culture of Wisdom for all generations to come.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>A Fine Culture, is self repairing, and it always heals,</p>
          <p>it towers over forces of poverty, pain, bondage, fear, anger, hopelessness, shyness, and loneliness.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And a fine culture is what we expect of the adults that we meet as children,</p>
          <p>once we become this culture, and the children learn that it is real.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>The children will see it as an actual, realistic aim to grow into,</p>
          <p>and they will enter a culture of beginning their lives, by resuming at the point where we leave off.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>In order for Humanity to Grow,</p>
          <p>a Central Universal Culture of Knowledge, Wisdom, and Excellence, should emerge.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>A Central Meeting Point,</p>
          <p>for all cultures that choose to leave bad ideas behind and converge on Wisdom and Peace.</p>
