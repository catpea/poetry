          <p>It has been a quarter of a century, but I still remember the sounds of New York,</p>
          <p>I can almost hear the busy parks, and cars and the occasional police siren.</p>

          <p>I still remember that a slice of New York Pizza across the street,</p>
          <p>is one dollar and twenty five cents, I am sure no pizza takes that! amazing anymore.</p>

          <p>While I never had a problem with fractions and the sixteenth of an inch,</p>
          <p>glancing 9/16 or 7/8 on a piece of paper, makes me want to begin with a calculator in hand.</p>

          <p>I never figured out how to spell the word &quot;W&quot;, I know it is written as a letter, but how do you spell it,</p>
          <p>and I love that the letter &quot;W&quot; may actually mean Double-U; fantastic.</p>

          <p>My reptile brain just accepted somehow that every few months it gets boiling hot outside,</p>
          <p>during hot summers, I catch my self staring at my thermometer that extra second longer,</p>
