          <p>Try to imagine yourself born in different places or to different cultures,</p>
          <p>note how you are influenced by all the surrounding factors.</p>

        <section>
          <p>Note, how there are parts of you that never do change,</p>
          <p>that form some kind of a foundation.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Rather, than than letting your place of birth or culture influence you,</p>
          <p>imagine inventing yourself <strong>independently</strong> of everything.</p>
