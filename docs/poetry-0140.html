          <p>We are granted Consciousness,</p>
          <p>but given no guarantees by the Universe.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>The only guarantee we have is Ourselves,</p>
          <p>the one Element that we are truly in control of.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>The deliberate act of Growing Up,</p>
          <p>is a constant reminder of that control.</p>

        <section>
          <p>Dusk and Twilight, Tears in the Rain, and Aches in Every Muscle,</p>
          <p>surrounded by Unfairness, Blindness, Ends Everywhere, and yet we Rise.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Though it may be the very end of some world,</p>
          <p>we are never robbed of the choice to keep going forward.</p>

        <section>
          <p>The choice to exert control over the walls that the Universe has us up against,</p>
          <p>when all else has gone dark, the choice always remains.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And when we can no longer change the World,</p>
          <p>then we have to grow up to gain new powers that fit that world better.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>The new powers will, alter the world,</p>
          <p>and eventually we will find our way back home.</p>

        <section>
          <p>No matter what misery or battles mark our past,</p>
          <p>having chosen to Rise, and Learn, and Rebuild; made us Beautiful.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>No matter what challenges lie ahead,</p>
          <p>The Great Act of Growing Up, is an Inexhaustible Source of Unlimited Wisdom.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And the sum of it all,</p>
          <p>is the Great Health and Joy of Life.</p>
