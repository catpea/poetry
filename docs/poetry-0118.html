          <p>Back when I was a Teenager,</p>
          <p>one late Friday afternoon.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I had a nap, so amazing,</p>
          <p>I have never forgotten about it.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I woke up light as a feather,</p>
          <p>and I dressed beautifully.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And went exploring,</p>
          <p>little Coffee Shops in Plymouth.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I went to see The Brew Ha Ha,</p>
          <p>full of Mighty Minds with Extreme Dreams.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I peeked into Coffee Studio,</p>
          <p>and saw Angel-headed Hipsters reading Tolstoy.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I poked into The Bean,</p>
          <p>full of Dirty Hippies, reciting Beautiful Poetry.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I made my way back home,</p>
          <p>walking alone through streets of gold.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I read Chaucer,</p>
          <p>programmed Visual Basic.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And went back to sleep,</p>
          <p>full of new memories that I would keep.</p>
