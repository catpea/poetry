          <p>You know how every once in a while you hear a beautiful piano song,</p>
          <p>and when it is over something is missing, something feels too quiet.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It means that the piano,</p>
          <p>or whatever it is that is moving you, is calling to you.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And that it is timeless,</p>
          <p>and that it is part of us.</p>

          <p>The same way that the yellow of the Dandelion would call to us,</p>
