          <p>Without learning we cannot grow up,</p>
          <p>and without teaching the world cannot progress.</p>

          <p>It does not matter where you start your journey,</p>
          <p>be it top of the world, or the very bottom, or somewhere in the middle.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Wherever you start, you must immediately begin moving forward,</p>
          <p>step after step, find what moves you, use it to grow up.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Grow to create a solid thought, or dream, or aim, or understanding,</p>
          <p>and get on top of it, and start building the next thing.</p>

        <section>
          <p>The road to catching up with everyone else is very short,</p>
          <p>once you are there, like everyone else, you take off in your own unique direction.</p>

        <section>
          <p>We must let go of beginnings and ends,</p>
          <p>and questions of lengths of road we must travel.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>We must let go of things that we can&apos;t finish in time to enjoy life,</p>
          <p>empires ought be build by generations of visionaries, not a single inspired being.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>We must put majority of our existence towards a happy meaningful life,</p>
          <p>not struggle, or war, or fear, but simple meaningful beautiful happiness.</p>

          <p>We must not forget about the importance of Meaningful and Enlightening Education,</p>
          <p>the world is not able to give all a safe home but we can learn to build one.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And once we learn, and find peace in life,</p>
          <p>we should consider becoming teachers.</p>

        <section>
          <p>By teaching people, by giving them the right tools, by helping them see how to accomplish great deeds,</p>
          <p>we also grant them the path, to get where they will bloom at their healthiest, and thus Find Hope.</p>

        <section>
          <p>Inadequate education is one of the greatest barriers to a healthy existence,</p>
          <p>but it is also the <strong>weakest</strong> barrier, as it is removed with simple audio-books.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>We should encourage people to search for best selling non fiction,</p>
          <p>and inherit both Lessons, and the Culture of Successful Great Beings.</p>

          <p>All the problems we face are Human Problems, and thus the solution is in Our Hands,</p>
          <p>as humans we know that the source of our Powers is in our Minds.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>That is where must begin our Lives,</p>
          <p>by making our minds Strong, Noble, Authentic, Unbreakable; Dignified.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Let the self correcting nature of inheritance of knowledge from all our Beloved Great Beings,</p>
          <p>be the start of our battle against all the problems that plague our Civilization and Cultures.</p>

          <p>Without wisdom all serious problems bear negative consequences,</p>
          <p>consequences that help to multiply problems until there seemingly seems to be no solution in sight.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>But that is an illusion,</p>
          <p>instead of building more prisons to contain minds sickened by poverty, let us teach meaningful wisdom and knowledge.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>We must learn to prevent minds from fracturing, and from getting lost, and from not growing up,</p>
          <p>we must build a better world for all.</p>

        <section>
          <p>To build a better world we must fearlessly challenge ourselves to success,</p>
          <p>to wisdom, to knowledge, to noble pursuits of excellence.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And then boldly teach,</p>
          <p>all the lessons that moved us.</p>
