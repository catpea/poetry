        <div class="section">
          <p>Normally,</p>
          <p>you want to go as simple as possible.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>So the main file to your program should not be the program it self,</p>
          <p>but rather a kind of an index of all the things that you are calling.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It should be written for your <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHJd-vk5x7k">Rubber Duck</a>,</p>
          <p>for your tired self few years down the road.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The opening file to your program,</p>
          <p>ties everything together, reveals the structure of the whole thing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It should be basic if/then statements,</p>
          <p>and calls to functions that do the actual work.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If you ever change your mind about something in your program,</p>
          <p>you will only have to edit that simple main file to make the changes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But, as you can imagine, some programs can get really complex,</p>
          <p>even a simple chat application can turn a simple program into non sequential madness.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Where things jump out of the server at you,</p>
          <p>when for example someone sends you a private message.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>All of a sudden, your program can&apos;t have a starting point,</p>
          <p>can&apos;t to things in a sequence.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is no longer like the music roll in a player piano,</p>
          <p>but more like a telegraph, a radio, or a phone.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It first has to listen,</p>
          <p>and only then can it execute its functions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>So there is this programming pattern, or a strategy called Event Emitter,</p>
          <p>and it only really has two things, it is part of its beauty.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The event emitter can listen to events,</p>
          <p>and it can emit events.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In a chat program,</p>
          <p>it would listen for an event named &quot;incoming-message&quot;.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The thing that it would listen to is is the web server,</p>
          <p>you need a hosting company that will sell you a server for about $5 per month.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Once you install the chat program, and someone connects to it,</p>
          <p>and types something in, and hits send...</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>They will be emitting an event to the server,</p>
          <p>let us call this event &quot;outgoing-message&quot;.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>So the stranger presses the send button,</p>
          <p>and the now-standard-program attached to the &quot;outgoing-message&quot; event...</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Will grab the text that the stranger typed in,</p>
          <p>create a data object and then send it to the server.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The server will then send the object to all the users in the chat,</p>
          <p>and that will be represented as the &quot;incoming-message&quot; event...</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Here the event handler will take the text out of the object,</p>
          <p>and stick it into the chat window.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>All this requires maybe 20 lines of code,</p>
          <p>it is a very simple program, as an example, it is just two events, &quot;incoming-message&quot; and &quot;outgoing-message&quot;,</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Both of those events have very simple programs attached to them,</p>
          <p>these programs are just five line functions, and the correct term for them is event handler.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Once an event is received by the event emitter,</p>
          <p>it will trigger the event handler.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And yes the event handlers can also emit events,</p>
          <p>making the entire program come to life.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And that is it,</p>
          <p>Event Emitter can listen for events, or emit them.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p><a href="https://github.com/catpea/bowel/blob/507c8e00eef06a7ba72a2d9105025e749cb94cbe/src/compiler/plugins/create-website/index.mjs#L28">My most recent use of the EventEmitter, was just about a week ago</a>,</p>
          <p>I had to say, once the server has started, then begin downloading its files.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I wanted to create a very simple abstraction,</p>
          <p>and not need to worry about what server I will end up using, or how long it will take for it to start.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>One of my most favorite ways of perceiving the event emitter,</p>
          <p>is to see it as a command system, instead of thinking about emitting an event, I think about executing a command.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And my most colorful use of the Event Emitter,</p>
          <p>was for a MUD program, an interactive Text Adventure Game.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I made a world that consisted of locations like room, palace, woods,</p>
          <p>and then send a Golden Snitch from Harry Potter Movies through it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The Golden Snitch, when opening doors,</p>
          <p>would actually trigger the Open Door event and i9nteract with the environment.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>(I don&apos;t know what a Golden Snitch does in Harry Potter&apos;s books,</p>
          <p>I am a fan of Twilight, I never had time for Harry Potter, but maybe some day.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>One time after a long programming session for a charity event,</p>
          <p>my teammates and I were asked to to step out for a photo.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And the day was so ridiculous bright that I before I could stop myself I said,</p>
          <p>if I step into that sun I am going to sparkle like a vampire from Twilight.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This was a weekend long programming session,</p>
          <p>and I really didn&apos;t like the idea of mixing PHP with JavaScript when node.js was already around.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I was wearing my superman shirt, one one programmer, was fool enough to say &quot;Hey Superman&quot;,</p>
          <p>to which I quickly replied *Good morning Lois* in the most Clark Kent voice I could muster.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I am pretty sure nobody liked me there,</p>
          <p>I was justifying to be funny.)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Anyway, the Golden Snitch led me to a new appreciation for the Event Emitter,</p>
          <p>it makes creating virtual worlds very simple, and very fun, I called it Thought Programming, because of how little work needs to get done.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And since it does not matter if it is a Non Playable Character or a User moving through an environment,</p>
          <p>it is fun to watch things happening all on their own when just the bots are bumping into each other.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>As a side note, I once connected two chat bots together over a network,</p>
          <p>and they started chatting to one another, and asking and sometimes answering each other&apos;s questions, that is a perfect job for the emitter, it was like 15 lines of code.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In closing, the Event Emitter makes complicated things simple,</p>
          <p>and if you stick to structuring your entire program out of events, you can create a beautiful diagram of it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Even without a computer, armed with just an... arm and a pencil, you can start sketching complicated multi-input/multi-user programs,</p>
          <p>with multiple things creating ordered chaos.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If you are just starting out with programming,</p>
          <p>try to imagine how you would create a program you like, by just listening to, and emitting events.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And if there is ever a program that is confusing you,</p>
          <p>try wrapping it in an Event Emitter, and giving it a simpler front-end.</p>
