          <p>Just like you can&apos;t be told what to learn,</p>
          <p>you can&apos;t quite just sit down and have a successful study session.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is not guaranteed to work,</p>
          <p>allow me to explain with something similar to learning: inspirational teaching.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>When I write these poems, I often try to teach you music,</p>
          <p>and I often fail, my lecture gets completely destroyed, and I end up writing about something else.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If you sit down to something that captured your attention,</p>
          <p>without a tiny little brilliant plan, it may fall apart on you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You need a passion for a subject,</p>
          <p>and a little bit of rest, so that you can dream up a strategy to get your foot in the door.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Often times what defines a successful session,</p>
          <p>is a strategy that you came up with indirectly, the rest of the time it is mostly luck.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

        <div class="section">
          <p>When I started learning BASIC,</p>
          <p>I wanted to make the computer answer my questions by printing text on the TV.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>That was an automatic strategy,</p>
          <p>that I did not notice I was having.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>When I wanted to draw on the TV screen (this was back in the 90&apos;s),</p>
          <p>I just wanted to see a simple line, that was a strategy, just get to a simple line.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>There was no learning involved,</p>
          <p>at all, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDZ26vj4vFM">I bought the book, I drew the line.</a></p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>What I was doing here,</p>
          <p>is becoming a programmer.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Let me give you a better example,</p>
          <p>I will give you such a good example, that you will not be able to walk away from the computer.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And once you do,</p>
          <p>your imagination will be out of control, and you will be composing your own music.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>First search YouTube for a tutorial,</p>
          <p>on how to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSqQgnUX0wM">install lmms</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrMTlpeSw8Y&amp;list=PLqazFFzUAPc4K1To5JTtR3cskcdRifM1M">take a few tutorials</a>,</p>
          <p>just so that you know how to get to the piano roll.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And here is the strategy,</p>
          <p>but I must warn you first... this is so amazing, that it will haunt you until you do it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If you are busy,</p>
          <p>then stop reading or listening to what I am about to say.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You are going to learn how to hack a song,</p>
          <p>you will be pulled right into it, AND UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING IMPORTANT ABOUT MUSIC.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Let me give you some background on the song,</p>
          <p>because this adventure does not just end with you gaining an insight into music, and composing your own songs, nuh uh.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Let just leave the Grand Finale for the end,</p>
          <p>and focus on just the song.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>When I was searching for new songs,</p>
          <p>the top original modern-dance-song comes up as Faded, by Alan Walker.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The lyrics are sad, maybe some day YOU can fix that,</p>
          <p>by making them about the re-discovery of Atlantis, and turn the song into a never-ending love story.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But lyrics aside,</p>
          <p>this is a 90 beats per minute song, with a wonderful <b>two part</b> piano opening.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We will focus just on that piano opening,</p>
          <p>and the aim is to make it your own.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Start by downloading <a href="https://lmms.io/lsp/?action=show&amp;file=8944">Faded by Peter F</a>,</p>
          <p>from the LMMS sharing platform.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Peter created a Faded clone,</p>
          <p>that relies only on the built in lmms instruments.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You will also catch a glimpse,</p>
          <p>of a pro configuring instruments in lmms.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Open the &quot;Alan Walker - Faded.mmpz&quot;,</p>
          <p>in your lmms, and hit play.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You can double click on the various parts of the song,</p>
          <p>to inspect the notes in the piano roll.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This is already quite an amazing look into a song,</p>
          <p>but there is more.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Faded is so popular that there are multiple tutorials,</p>
          <p>on how to disassemble it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Multiple videos on people back engineering that song,</p>
          <p>you get to see how the song is being put together.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Not only can you open the song in lmms,</p>
          <p>and inspect its parts, and see how it creates sounds, and the actual song.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But now you get to see, people reasoning about it,</p>
          <p>playing with it in their own programs:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Take a look at the two minute tutorial by amzine, entitled:</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You can see the same pattern of notes in your lmms,</p>
          <p>in Faded by Peter F.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Being able to see how a song is put together,</p>
          <p>and actually having it put together on your screen, goes a long way to inspire you to keep going.</p>
