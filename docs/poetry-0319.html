        <div class="section">
          <p>Woodland Adventures are pretty goofy, one moment you are tired and deprived,</p>
          <p>and the next, marching back to the camp with an ice cream sandwich in hand.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I am ashamed to admit that I am the only person that has ever gotten lost at Nordhouse,</p>
          <p>It was my first time at the Nurnberg Trailhead so I was double excited.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I marveled at the sophistication of the site,</p>
          <p>including the shoe scrapers that remove seeds and mud, as not to cross-contaminate sites.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>There is a 90 degree turn early on, and I tend to walk forward,</p>
          <p>that&apos;s where I got lost the trail the first time.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I found my self facing a large grassy field and murmured cheerfully,</p>
          <p>there are *blep* snakes in these *bleep* plains.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>A little further on, there was so much greenery and life,</p>
          <p>and out in the distance I spotted what seemed like a dune.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>So I got off the trail and headed right for it,</p>
          <p>it is a very short trail, and the dunes are very big.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In no more than three minutes, I discovered that the dune I saw...</p>
          <p>was just a well lit tree, and that there were trees everywhere, and no trail in sight.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>There was no point in turning around, because I was already turned around,</p>
          <p>so I did what every adventurer always does, I started walking in circles.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>To my horror I discovered that enormous spiderwebs would often block my roundabout way,</p>
          <p>and I&apos;d have to make circles around those too.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I remember becoming transfixed by a particularly large and seemingly thick Arachnid Installation,</p>
          <p>and then my heart sinking as I felt an evil presence behind me.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I jumped around, to discover another confused man,</p>
          <p>only to realize that I was back on the trail and his expression of confusion was just how his face normally looked.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I immediately admitted that I got lost - peeling back some of the spider webs that ended up walking into,</p>
          <p>his expression of confusion turned to a smile...</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Earlier he was probably wondering what the hell I was doing bushwhacking in complex circles,</p>
          <p>whilst collecting all the spiderwebs in quiet panic, 20 feet from the trail.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Well, now he had his answer - I was an adventurer, in training,</p>
          <p>I was still learning the ropes, because it is not easy being green, in the green.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The hell with him,</p>
          <p>and all his stupid spiders.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Just the moment I promised myself to stay on the trail until I got to the beach,</p>
          <p>there was a fork in the road, I wisely chose the path pointing towards lake Michigan.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I was basically lost again, crossing through terrain that was clearly barely walked,</p>
          <p>I made it back to the main trail, the one pointing away from the lake.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Covered in a toxic cloud of insect repellent,</p>
          <p>and some seriously pissed off mosquitoes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I itched my way to the edge of the tree line,</p>
          <p>and took a leap of faith into the bright sun and sandy dunes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It was like discovering an Ocean,</p>
          <p>everything seemed so huge, the dunes were enormous.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It was a beautiful adventure, on a sunny and beautiful day,</p>
          <p>I swam in the lake, watched the sunset, and I had sausages for dinner.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I probably stayed out there a whole month, collecting fossils, making walking sticks, eating ice cream,</p>
          <p>and then I went back few months later, in early Fall for even more silly adventures.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I remember advising a group a hikers to take the right the more traveled path at the fork,</p>
          <p>many new comers take the one on the left towards the lake, but that one is more difficult.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>...and whatever you do,</p>
          <p>stay on the trail, and don&apos;t take any shortcuts.</p>
        </div>
