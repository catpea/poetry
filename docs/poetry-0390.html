          <p>The primary purpose of High School would be the creation</p>
          <p>of the beginning of the road to financial independence.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The more successful their business undertakings,</p>
          <p>the more money they would make.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Teachers, and experienced students, would help groups of founders,</p>
          <p>with formation of small sturdy companies.</p>

          <p>To be clear, the idea of dividing Middle School from High School,</p>
          <p>based on age, is a stupid idea.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>A person starts High School when Middle School ceases to be challenging,</p>
          <p>Middle School is just a simpler and slower version of High School.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>These schools are for young people,</p>
          <p>what divides High School from College is the number of talks and presentations about how the world functions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Talks are events where renowned speakers and professionals share their thoughts,</p>
          <p>be it via video lectures or in person.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>These presentations will help the students discover their curiosities,</p>
          <p>and find a few paths that they may wish to explore in more detail.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Teachers should be present here, especially during pre-recorded presentations,</p>
          <p>these teachers are mostly made up of successful graduates, success is a requirement for the position.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>High School will require a network of Investors to whom the students may present their ideas,</p>
          <p>should the ideas require external investment.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>By the age of 20, when students are ready to move on to College,</p>
          <p>they should have several small side-businesses and belong to at least one multi-founder company that shows great promise.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is only fair that Students, the future of this world,</p>
          <p>should not begin their lives in poverty.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>College is just a more complex version of High School,</p>
          <p>where High School makes Business Creation easy, College is an introduction to business and legal frameworks, going public and investing and so on.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>No everyone will wish to spend their days on Practical Applications,</p>
          <p>people who find more inspiration in the Theoretical or Virtual will be guided towards existing companies that require that type of talent.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If something does go wrong,</p>
          <p>College is the place that will help Students repair, or rebuild, or change directions.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Text books, are replaced with a Knowledge Map, an open global collaborative network of lectures, narrated books, and countless presentations,</p>
          <p>The World Curriculum.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This is the scaffold that guides students to their calling, or new inventions, or curiosities,</p>
          <p>it is a self paced system of open pathways previously taken by other students.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Communities of students will organically emerge and form networks throughout the World Curriculum,</p>
          <p>and like minded individuals of varying levels of expertise will be able to openly discuss their curiosities.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This is a very fluid system driven by curiosities and financial independence,</p>
          <p>one that offers guidance and a great deal of inspiration by means of presentations, lectures, and talks.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>There is not enough rigidity here to discourage a Composer, or prevent an Artist from reaching their dreams,</p>
          <p>the new School System, is meant to accelerate the Development of Human Kind.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We must never stand in the way of the younger generations,</p>
          <p>we must honor the younger generations with Real Education, and Real Future.</p>
