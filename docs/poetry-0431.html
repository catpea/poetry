          <p>My uncle left for Africa and later America,</p>
          <p>and left behind was this interestingly scratchy and neatly smelling postcard.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It turned out that the city pictured there,</p>
          <p>was New York.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Being a fan of the new things,</p>
          <p>I begun getting used to the idea that I would have to live there for a couple of years.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I had some problems,</p>
          <p>that I first needed to solve.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The biggest problem was,</p>
          <p>actually pretty big.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Because, I was very smol,</p>
          <p>I might have been seven, maybe nine, but at nine it wouldn&apos;t seem like such a big problem.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In a word,</p>
          <p>I needed to become an adult.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>That New Yorkers spoke a different language,</p>
          <p>would have registered if I though about it, but I had my hands full with growing up.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It wasn&apos;t long before my parents bought me my Commodore 64,</p>
          <p>since everyone was saying &quot;Computers Are The Future&quot; I figured I should learn how to use it too.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Right about the same time, we begun receiving the British Sky Broadcasting Network signal,</p>
          <p>and the linguistic barrier hit pretty hard.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We also had Pro 7 and RTL, which was in German,</p>
          <p>but it was showing Rosanne, which was about America.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>On one end I was learning about America in German,</p>
          <p>and learning English from The DJ Kat show on the British TV.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I once knew as much German as English,</p>
          <p>and I actually used German in real life once.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>On my way back from a trip to Netherlands,</p>
          <p>as we stopped on a rest area in Germany a Harley Davidson rider came up to us and asked:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>&quot;Was ist die uhre?&quot;,</p>
          <p>I made my colleague show him his watch.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The rider might not have realized,</p>
          <p>that we didn&apos;t speak German.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It wasn&apos;t long before I ended up in New York,</p>
          <p>in Brooklyn, the city with streets paved with gold (or Mica as I was told)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I had to fill out some medical paperwork,</p>
          <p>across the city, so it was as good of a time as any to ride the freaking subway for the first freaking time.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I did not get lost,</p>
          <p>but let me just reveal to you what it was like.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>All the station names I memorized, over an over, so that I wouldn&apos;t get lost, or miss my stop,</p>
          <p>they were all wrong, they didn&apos;t sound anything like what I memorized.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Only a small part of this was the speaker,</p>
          <p>I memorized them in the language I knew, not the everyone that New Yorkers spoke.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And the same thing happened, a person walked up top me and asked &quot;Do yo have the time?&quot;,</p>
          <p>well I did, but in the heat of the moment, I only knew the numbers separately, and I wasn&apos;t sure if I should say 1-5, or 3.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And it was just too much,</p>
          <p>so in my best British Tongue, I uttered: &quot;I don&apos;t speak English&quot;.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>They asked something else,</p>
          <p>but I already failed that test.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Now, I was learning English, I was doing very well,</p>
          <p>and if I had 45 seconds, to pull my self together I would have remembered Fifteen, and to say 3PM, instead, and maybe even throw in you&apos;re welcome, to show off.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But,</p>
          <p>I was 42 seconds short.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This is a good thing,</p>
          <p>because all lessons aside, this is how you begin learning a language for real.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I never practiced numbers, or days of the week,</p>
          <p>I just willed myself to know them, from all the TV I watched, and Closed Captions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Once I had my medical paperwork,</p>
          <p>and went to school.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The English teacher ACCUSED ME, of knowing English,</p>
          <p>of pretending no to speak it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And she failed me multiple times,</p>
          <p>there was this hokey ceremony where everyone was getting awards for achievement, and I didn&apos;t get one.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The person I was sitting next to was laughing - that he got one,</p>
          <p>but the English teacher removed me from that list, because she was convinced I didn&apos;t achieve anything, that I was pretending not to speak English.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I was so proud of myself,</p>
          <p>and I wasn&apos;t scared of her at all.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>She made a acquaintance of mine, Ewa cry,</p>
          <p>and I went to the principal, who I am sure gave her a stern talk.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>English turned out to be a lot larger than I expected,</p>
          <p>but being exposed to these situations especially stressful or insulting, makes us hungry for language.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Not so long after that,</p>
          <p>I was working in Wyandotte on web design, which is is very easy to learn, and I highly recommend it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And a client complained that they couldn&apos;t understand me,</p>
          <p>and the office started discussing how my accent was heavy, I was now able to speak but accent was heavy, something I couldn&apos;t quite hear myself.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Though you can still hear traces of it in the way I pronounce the word Basic,</p>
          <p>I can&apos;t feel anything wrong with the way I pronounce it, until; I hear it on audio.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>BASIC is the name of a programming language, and one of the first words that I learned in English,</p>
          <p>and I was still pronounce it the Polish way.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But get this, later, it turned out,</p>
          <p>my accent was fine, it was my babbling about connecting to FTP servers, and talking about HTML tags, HTML tables that caused the trouble.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It was still somewhat stressful to speak to strangers,</p>
          <p>but now the stress was revealing it self in not being tactful about their vocabulary.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I think it is safe to say,</p>
          <p>that it was a huge milestone in my self education.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Reading wasn&apos;t much of a problem,</p>
          <p>I think we underestimate the magic of closed captioned TV, I think that is what taught to me to read.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I plowed through a shelf of cheap paperbacks,</p>
          <p>and I had zero problems with comprehension, I was reading books about UFOs and really enjoyed it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>By the time books on tape, or narrated books came up on my radar,</p>
          <p>I felt perfectly comfortable with English.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Though Narrated Books, are a powerful tool for learning English,</p>
          <p>and just learning in general.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And this is my recommendation,</p>
          <p>whatever language you are hoping to learn, Narrated Books will get you most of the way there.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>To finish it off, you will need to permanently move to that country,</p>
          <p>even if you don&apos;t speak the language yet, an mingle and soak up the new culture.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If you are not sure which language to pick,</p>
          <p>choose English, because part of the beauty of a language lies lies in the number of countries you can day dream about moving to.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And if you ever take to visit UK,</p>
          <p>whatever you do, leave your fanny pack at home, and do not use the word &quot;fanny&quot; lightly, or at all.</p>
