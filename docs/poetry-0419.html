        <div class="section">
          <p>Let me just open by hypothesizing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxyKNMrhEvY">why schools are not teaching</a>,</p>
          <p>it is because they don&apos;t actually know how, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hh6uHUx728"></a>since everyone gets paid anyway, they see no reason to fix it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Let us use, learning a photo editing program, as an example,</p>
          <p>today schools use multiple choice tests to asses the knowledge of a subject.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Instead of evaluating the students by for example asking them to create a fake photo,</p>
          <p>hide it among real photographs and let the class try to guess which is the fake one.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Schools use questions like, what is the purpose of image desaturation?</p>
          <p>A) making it sharper, B) making it lighter, C) all of the above, D) we&apos;re pretending to teach to take a paycheck home.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I know that in a real image editing class, an actual program is used,</p>
          <p>but the photo editing program we are using here, is an analogy for mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is meant to demonstrate fake lectures,</p>
          <p>and matching ineffective tests, in serious subject.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But even in a real photo editing class, the teachers still end up failing the students,</p>
          <p>because the real grade would have to be opening a successful photography business and making $100.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This could be signing up with Unsplash, and using the site to become a Droneographer or a wedding photographer,</p>
          <p>see, just learning how to use a photo editing program is useless.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The class must begin with photography, center around image editing,</p>
          <p>and passing all the students that now have a functional business.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Schools can&apos;t do this, because it would reveal them as ineffective,</p>
          <p>so as long as we are OK, with them being already ineffective, we are wasting our time, and the time of all the children.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Oh and by the, your kid is not supposed work Fast Food, or Retail,</p>
          <p>those are not jobs for the children that represent the Future of Human Kind.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Schools, actually could provide the students with 3 to 10 &quot;side projects&quot;,</p>
          <p>a side project is a miniature business, that makes about a $100 a month.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>To return to our analogy for mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology,</p>
          <p>these subjects are not being tested, the only thing that is tested here is the students ability to temporary memorize.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This is fraud, math is actually quite testable,</p>
          <p>but since schools are not teaching, all the children would fail math on a real test.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The math nerds, are not a vote for things working out sometimes,</p>
          <p>they are self taught, they learn about math, math history, and the underlying concepts on their own, they learn for real.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The lectures are ineffective, the tests only test memorization and lying,</p>
          <p>and all the class really teaches is how to cram before a test, which works great for a factory job as well.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Imagine a factory, that would give its employees surprise college entry exams,</p>
          <p>about every month on average - what would that reveal about the employees, would they all continue passing the surprise tests?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I would guess,</p>
          <p>they would all fail with a low score.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>That is because they only retain what they learned for a few days,</p>
          <p>they aren&apos;t actually educated, they are memorizing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Now, that I painted a certain picture for you,</p>
          <p>and let you make your own conclusions, lets fix this up.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Unfortunately I have to mention every step that led me to this architecture,</p>
          <p>and the first one is a little creepy, so lets just get it out of the way.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In 1985 Orson Scott Card introduced the idea of a game like intelligence test,</p>
          <p>for Andrew &quot;Ender&quot; Wiggin, in his si-fi book Ender&apos;s Game.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>When I read the book, I already suspected that creating a game like educational experience,</p>
          <p>could be useful in real education.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>About a decade back, one of the science popularized released a game that dealt with space,</p>
          <p>and currently there is an a game entitled <a href="https://youtu.be/F0KiePxOuuc?t=294">Kerbal Space Program</a> that teachers Orbital Dynamics, this is by a different publisher.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>About eight years ago I came across the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification">Gamemification, making serious things game like</a>,</p>
          <p>wikipedia describes it as:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>&quot;Gamemification strategic attempt to enhance systems, services, organisations and activities,</p>
          <p>in order to create similar experiences to those experienced when playing games,</p>
          <p>in order to motivate and engage users.&quot;</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Let us pause here for a moment, and note that Kerbal Space Program like game,</p>
          <p>is a good example of a real test of knowledge of Mathematics, Physics, and Orbital Dynamics.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The student fails an Orbital Dynamics lecture, if they are unable to put a simulated shuttle in earths orbit,</p>
          <p>this is a real test of real knowledge.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The precise scenario the student will be presented will be random, it could be the sun&apos;s orbit,</p>
          <p>geo stationary orbit, or get a ship nearing mars into the martian orbit.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>There will be a series of tests and paid internships,</p>
          <p>that ends in working for NASA or ESA, or some private company.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>These organizations have a say in the tests that they require,</p>
          <p>the school will be influenced by industry seeking talent, and not politicians seeking re-elections.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The student will see employment statistics,</p>
          <p>they will be able to make an informed decision about this particular job market.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Not everyone likes space things,</p>
          <p>space is a cold and dangerous place.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We all had music class at some point,</p>
          <p>and many of us didn&apos;t realize that we could have a side job as a DJ, as a musician.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Music composition takes just a couple of days, if not hours,</p>
          <p>when taught right.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRvkaxh8EU">children can&apos;t be taught musical notation, they have to be taught how to use lmms</a>,</p>
          <p>teaching children musical notation is fraud, musical notation is for people who are ready to study existing music.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Kids just want to compose at first, and they don&apos;t actually know the full picture of what they want,</p>
          <p>because their songs can make them money, just about all it takes is thinking of a song as six little songs ov varying complexity and instruments, they can upload that to bandcamp.com or similar.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>There would need to exist a music label for students, so that their music can get on spotify and the radio,</p>
          <p>I am sure there are many companies that would love to do that for free, passing on all the profits on students, if not one would be created for that purpose.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Of course in the music class of today,</p>
          <p>we are taught nonsense, and pushed along to memorize for the final and put it all behind us, in preparations for poverty resulting from unforgivable student loans.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Finally, before I looked at schools, I realized that Audio Books can help prison inmates a great deal,</p>
          <p>it is not possible to describe the importance of easy access to beautiful narrated books in prisons.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I would ask celebrities, to specifically create a prison version of a narration,</p>
          <p>a separate narration from what is given to school students.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Some people aren&apos;t willing to read for high school kids,</p>
          <p>but would be greatly honored, and in fact greatly appreciated, if they narrated great books for inmates.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This is so important,</p>
          <p>history will not look kindly at mass incarceration and legal slavery, they will not look kindly at our ignorance and arrogance, and failure to prevent children from becoming criminals.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And here we arrive at an explanation of the very architecture,</p>
          <p>of the new school.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>There is no building, no rent, and no fraudulent moochers, or big fat white lice, not to mention spoiled lemons,</p>
          <p>that pretend to teach children.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Parent&apos;s don&apos;t get to use school as a convenient baby sitter,</p>
          <p>actually the stress of High School and College, exposes children to drugs, school is a pretty nasty baby sitter.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>A tablet, large, free to replace, open source Linux Tablet similar to the <a href="https://www.pine64.org/pinetab/">PINETAB</a>,</p>
          <p>it presented to each student, there is a strong emphasis on socializing, and making friend in real life.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vHzUTtmbAM">But not behind the brick wall of a class room (trigger warning)</a>,</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmoor8DwqW4">children are not inmates, they are not meant to sit in rows memorizing noise, so that the teacher can take their fraudulent paycheck home</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>On the tablet there will be a series of programs, similar to the applications on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLPC_XO">OLPC XO</a>,</p>
          <p>but there will be one web application that will present a game like educational experience.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The students will still have stats, points or grades, this is somewhat kind of, similar to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FACg2r8OcF0">Dark Souls Player Status</a>,</p>
          <p>but here we will see things related to education.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>So passing and re-testing the Orbital Dynamics class,</p>
          <p>will increase different stats, like math, physics, astrophysics.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The student while still in school, will be asked to re-play the challenges,</p>
          <p>or games, that are used to refresh and refine their knowledge.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>To mention Kerbal Space Program again,</p>
          <p>students only need to learn how to get into the orbit once, the test are only there to help retain knowledge.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This is a real school and a real education,</p>
          <p>that is architected in such a way that the students end up getting contracts for well paying jobs, when their stats are high enough to qualify.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This is Real Education,</p>
          <p>and because the student chooses their own path, it also becomes really fun and respectful of their existing predispositions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The kids that get stuck with making music,</p>
          <p>are my favorite example.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Each school district will have a community of music makers,</p>
          <p>who don&apos;t want to get a job, because they already make a lot of money.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The orbital dynamics class example I give here, requires a little bit more explanation,</p>
          <p>not all students that end up in the aerospace industry will begin with love for NASA.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Orbital Dynamics, is needed for several things, Generative Art Classes, Animation Classes, Computer Game Classes,</p>
          <p>whatever requires a decent knowledge of Netwon&apos;s calculus.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>So it is not just this Orbital Dynamics class,</p>
          <p>that pops up in a class list on their tablet.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is used by many courses,</p>
          <p>and what makes a course outstanding, is that it helps the student with making money.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Due to money being misunderstood,</p>
          <p>the world is cutting off the oxygen to its collective brain.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The classes presented to the students have to help the out of poverty,</p>
          <p>Generative Art is about selling large beautiful canvas, with intricate high resolution computer art.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Some of those graphics, will be created by trails of objects that use Newton&apos;s Calculus,</p>
          <p>animation classes lead to a job in graphic arts, providing videos for advertising purposes, or as background to long winded poetry.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And computer game classes, help the students sell apps, and games,</p>
          <p>here lmms is a good example, it helps a person compose in less than an hour, and there are game engines that won&apos;t require years of programming.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbtmAjhtPss">Level design can be a big subject</a>,</p>
          <p>but a lot of players are a lot better at level design than they assume.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The tools that are used for building the levels,</p>
          <p>are often part of the game, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcREQzsS0Hc">it just makes sense to be within the walls of the game to make the levels more intricate</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Some programming will be required, and that is the area that would call for Orbital Dynamics and Calculus,</p>
          <p>in a first person shooter the math would be related to animations, in a game like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLKudh3vvsU">asteroids</a> larger asteroids would attract the smaller ones with the force of gravity.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Graduation is about successfully learning something that results in pushing away poverty,</p>
          <p>in a perfect world education would be more pure, but in a world that misunderstood how to use money, money making must be taught in school.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Jut to repeat my opening remarks,</p>
          <p>schools shy away from real results and noble aims, because they don&apos;t know how to educate, they are a place where adults go to make money under the protection of a union and an ineffective cirricula.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Real school is a much more personal experience,</p>
          <p>and the access point is a computer tablet with Open Source software, where companies can&apos;t trick students into paying for what should be free.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The removal of stress that students experience when they realize they are being forced to pretend to learn by memorization or fail the class,</p>
          <p>will already make a big difference.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Letting the students choose their own path,</p>
          <p>and creating paths that help students become financially independent, will take care of the rest.</p>
