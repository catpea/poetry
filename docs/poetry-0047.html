          <p>Think of a trickster, a real bad fool.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>What a great robbery it would be.</p>
          <p>If your parents sent you to college.</p>
          <p>And teachers sold disconnected snippets.</p>
          <p>And called it knowledge.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And wouldn&apos;t it be convenient,</p>
          <p>if you could chose you next batch.</p>
          <p>Wouldn&apos;t the trickster rejoice,</p>
          <p>had you called, that, a choice.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And then at the end of the day.</p>
          <p>When hard earned money was taken.</p>
          <p>You wouldn&apos;t even be shaking,</p>
          <p>even though it was worse than a break-in.</p>

        <section>
          <p>Think of a trickster, a real bad fool,</p>
          <p>that took away your very own school.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>The moral of this story,</p>
          <p>is that you should think through,</p>
          <p>when someone offers to teach you.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Education, requires that you learn on your own,</p>
          <p>that something that teaching can only postpone.</p>
