          <p>Robert Ardrey once said,</p>
          <p>that we will be known among the stars by our poems.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>He meant poems in the broad sense of the word,</p>
          <p>surely.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Even more powerful than a poem,</p>
          <p>is a dance.</p>
        </div>

          <p>Dance was invented to keep warriors, fit,</p>
          <p>it was invented for battle.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But since,</p>
          <p>Humanity has grown to make it nobler.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>To make it beautiful,</p>
          <p>our dancing will be seen as one of our most magnificent ideas.</p>

          <p>I grew up with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AQjcmzvx8">Fred Astaire</a>,</p>
          <p>and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT_IiHsZtWg">Mr. Bean</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I think <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0tm7IjqGfk">Mr Beanbastic</a>,</p>
          <p>is a real gem.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Of course, so is the choreography of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELBy5stH3b8">Napoleon Dynamite Dance</a>,</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WojwivFSM">which is used in joyful tutorials</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RMteAzkORE">and epic dares</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It did not occur to me to start dancing until I saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB8nImV9Kp4">Big Daddy Fat</a> do it,</p>
          <p>it is a variation on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oTUupME0-M&amp;t=15s">Melbourne Shuffle</a> which has undergone great evolution.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We all remember <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miax0Jpe5mA">Flashdance</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ2lUog6jZ0">Dirty Dancing</a>,</p>
          <p>but very few of us realize that dancing is a very important part of growing up.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If you are not yet in shape, that is OK,</p>
          <p>begin with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_9FyTiq3SA">Rocky IV</a> style exercise, where you avoid machines and try to work and flex your full body.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Jog, shuffle your feet to lifting dumbbells, try swimming, skating, bicycling,</p>
          <p>or hitting the trails and camping through beautiful adventures.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If you are large, that means you already have the muscles,</p>
          <p>you just need a cute little diet.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Switch your meals to be dominated by shredded lettuce,</p>
          <p>and only flavored by your favorite foods, you can even stick a little bit of a hamburger, or cut up a hot-dog into your lettuce creation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Lettuce is less of a health food, and more of a filler material,</p>
          <p>it will lower the caloric density of your daily food intake, and help your muscles come through for you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Dancing,</p>
          <p>will help you set aside all that is not important.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And dancing will make you healthy,</p>
          <p>flexible, strong, and even grow your muscles more, so as long as you dance fast, honest, and every day.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The dance I recommend is the Shuffle Dance,</p>
          <p>it is a combination of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZvD9p8Btdk">Running Man</a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuzTnjTGW44">T-Step</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Once you get your feet used to the Running Man,</p>
          <p>take a look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc6B14K1SZ8">the move set tutorial by Anastasiia Kirilik</a> on YouTube for more moves.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Start with slow music <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ItHLz5WEA&amp;list=PLa2rOLrAc0awWA1Y3xN5uxqm31ui-49_4">Alan Walker</a> works great,</p>
          <p>please remember to use music during your practice, synchronize your running man with the beat, and the switch of the feet to the sound between the beat.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You need that beat,</p>
          <p>and it has to be a slow song that moves your feet.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Your feet learn dance the same way,</p>
          <p>that your brain learns a poem.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Just trying to dance,</p>
          <p>will get your feet prepared.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And you will make,</p>
          <p>fewer mistakes as you go.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Lastly, as you speed your music up, your shuffle may transform to a much more optimized and lower version,</p>
          <p>and that is OK, it is jut not possible to do the full Running Man to very fast music, so your feet will make a smaller motion to hit every beat.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Take good care of your play list,</p>
          <p>it only takes a few months to run out of all the songs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>A new and fresh song,</p>
          <p>will give you energy, your body will move much faster.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But as you get use to it,</p>
          <p>that energy will fade, so you have to keep searching for new songs, every week and sometimes every day.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>So as long as you dance,</p>
          <p>you will become better at it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Don&apos;t be scared,</p>
          <p>and don&apos;t be too shy.</p>
        </div>
