          <p>First of all, you can&apos;t just pick a subject out of the blue,</p>
          <p>nor can anybody tell you what you need to learn.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If you are forced to learn something under a threat,</p>
          <p>you are likely to memorize it, and thus create the wrong impression of the subject.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Saying &quot;I hate math&quot;,</p>
          <p>and keeping away from mathematical things is not healthy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Saying &quot;I hate school math.&quot;, and &quot;I hate the way they teach math&quot;,</p>
          <p>is correct.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Schools do not distinguish between forcing you to memorize something,</p>
          <p>and you actually learning something for real.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This helps them increase graduation rates,</p>
          <p>and keep getting funding, they depend on you pretending to learn.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Personally, I think the threat of failing a class,</p>
          <p>makes it so that it is wiser (in that context) to pretend to learn by memorizing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is not just one class that is broken,</p>
          <p>it is many overlapping classes, with disconnected and irrelevant subjects.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>There may not _be a way_ to learn it all for real,</p>
          <p>as the class curricula evolved along side students pretending to learn.</p>
        </div>

          <p>Just in case you need to hear it - and you shouldn&apos;t need to rely on hearing somebody else say it...</p>
          <p>schools are bad for us, they don&apos;t work, they probably can&apos;t work.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>A real school would pay you for grades,</p>
          <p>it would help you move into your own apartment, not a dorm room.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And it would help you begin saving money,</p>
          <p>you would graduate with enough money to buy a house, car, and start a little business.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In return, your level of education,</p>
          <p>would help your city, and nation, grow stronger, grow collectively wiser.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The money you would get from schools,</p>
          <p>is just an investment in your nations future.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Happy and well educated graduates,</p>
          <p>create a Happy and Well Educated, and Wise, Nation; and soon afer a Wiser World.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

        <div class="section">
          <p>Right now, our wisest Politicians, the greatest beings in Politics,</p>
          <p>are fighting for a livable minim wage, which is to say doubling the minimum wage.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And the companies that will have to pay double,</p>
          <p>are probably getting ready to cut their workforce in half, with automation and computers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I greatly admire these politicians, and they bring tears to my eyes,</p>
          <p>but the minimum wage shouldn&apos;t be $15 but, at least, $50.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>More than $50 per hour, 40 hours a week,</p>
          <p>full medical insurance, and lots of perks.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Personally, I feel that it should be $75/h,</p>
          <p>not $15.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Not only school is making it impossible to learn,</p>
          <p>but working for a large company is severely broken.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You need to ask yourself, what are you pretending to learn,</p>
          <p>in a school that doesn&apos;t care about real education?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>As you graduate higher,</p>
          <p>you need to ask if you should be paying for a mediocre education.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Why should you sink into years of stressful debt for a diploma,</p>
          <p>that will be easily beat by someone with a brand name education.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>People with brand name education often have plenty of financial support,</p>
          <p>sometimes their family members went to that school (see Legacy Ivy)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And later on, you also face the fact that family members tend to recruit family members into companies (nepotism),</p>
          <p>your GPA, Hard Work, Happy Graduation, and a Diploma is not guaranteed to matter to anybody.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The debt you incur, is guaranteed,</p>
          <p>you will not be able to file bankruptcy, your school debt will not be forgiven.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The way you can learn anything,</p>
          <p>is by accepting the responsibility for your own education.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And accepting the responsibility for launching a series of small start-ups,</p>
          <p>as you learn to become an Entrepreneur.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The problem with learning in school is that the information they are forcing you to memorize,</p>
          <p>is too abstract, it is irrelevant to you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>That is why, even if you tried learning for real,</p>
          <p>your knowledge of the subject will be such low quality, that companies won&apos;t even want to hire you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>They prefer candidates with years of experience,</p>
          <p>and anyway, you shouldn&apos;t be looking for an entry level position after years of studying.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Even though companies asking for years of experience for entry level positions,</p>
          <p>may still grant you a job, it will be - by their own definition - a less than entry level position.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Self Education, and Entrepreneurship, and putting yourself in positions where learning math will be relevant to your success,</p>
          <p>will help you learn for real.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Would you even think to yourself &quot;I hate math&quot;,</p>
          <p>if your company worked on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV0Tjwq7Uc0">self replicating 3D printers</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>When you are working in real context, on a meaningful project,</p>
          <p>that will help to launch your first company for example, it is never a question of learning, you just do it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>When you have a real world context, and an aim that is personally meaningful to you,</p>
          <p>you simply progress forward, you become so passionate about your education.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If you are not interested in 3D printing, then perhaps you will become interested in something that involves it,</p>
          <p>how about 3D printing fashion, art, musical instruments of apartment buildings for the homeless.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And if there is nothing in the world that can get you into math,</p>
          <p>then it will be your top engineer friend who will gently walk you through, seeing that you have great respect for her or him,</p>
          <p>but that you struggle to understand what they are doing sometimes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>There are countless pathways that can help you learn anything,</p>
          <p>Biology, and Combinatorial Genomics will easily call to you if you take to publishing a Journal Of Anti-aging, for example.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In conclusion, we can&apos;t learn in school, because it is too abstract,</p>
          <p>and the risk of failing a class and ruining a GPA is just too great.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But, we can learn if we put ourselves in a position where a subject is relevant to us,</p>
          <p>and it is far more than just learning, we become passionate about it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>By creating our own future, our own job in a company that we build,</p>
          <p>we no longer need to rely on minimum wage, and deal with unforgivable debt.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In a way, especially when we are young, self education becomes a school that does pay us for grades,</p>
          <p>there is no better grade, or reward, than running a small and successful, smartly positioned independent business.</p>
