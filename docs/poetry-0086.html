        <div class="section">
          <p>Our minds constantly construct boundaries,</p>
          <p>and constantly try to make us comfortable.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>But in an evolved world this works against us,</p>
          <p>it creates boundaries across which we hope to discharge pain.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>The source of the pain is poverty, poverty of mind and wallet,</p>
          <p>fear, pain, unfairness and inequality, add to the blindness.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>There is no solution on the level where poverty reins,</p>
          <p>it will always be walls turning people against each other.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>We are not ready for the next level,</p>
          <p>in the next level we recognize poverty as a virus.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>We see it as a Natural Disaster,</p>
          <p>we sit back, relax, calm down, print enough money to end it and move on.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>This does not mean everyone is going to be rich,</p>
          <p>it only means, nobody will be stuck in financial poverty.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>Poverty of mind, the other half of poverty is not even up for discussion,</p>
          <p>not until everyone has a safe home.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>All of this seems impossible, to many laughable,</p>
          <p>irrational, infantile, unfair even.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>For those of you who don&apos;t understand how someone could possibly call this unfair,</p>
          <p>some will angrily yell &quot;Why should someone get a free home, when I worked for mine, my entire life?&quot;.</p>

          <p>This is the Nature of the Walls,</p>
          <p>the picture of the great divide.</p>

          <p>A divide between who we are today,</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>So special, that active countermeasures must be put in place,</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>They must never be pressured, never become stressed or depressed,</p>

          <p>We can&apos;t see that, because the walls are invisible,</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Emboldened we dare to hold up our opinion,</p>

          <p>The thing that makes Humans Special,</p>

          <p>And it seems like we are still operating,</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I know that divided, the generations will always fight across pointless walls,</p>
