          <p>You are not ordinary, nor are you standard, nor should you ever be standardized in any way.</p>
          <p>you are a sacred being, and you are meant to bring more light to the word.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Be careful,</p>
          <p>do not allow anybody to take away your real knowledge, your real education.</p>

          <p>It is all too easy to fake the teaching of knowledge by tricking students into thinking that they can just do it with memorization,</p>
          <p>schools thrive on it.</p>

          <p>Schools push you into memorization,</p>
          <p>and then use your shame-of-not-knowing-for-real, keep you quiet.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>People who benefit from protecting schools and the fake education,</p>
          <p>will not have a problem cherry picking data to prove that fake schools are excellent at teaching.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>There will be promises, incentives, careers,</p>

          <p>Your education is too important,</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Just the fact alone that schools do little to distinguish functional knowledge from rote memorization,</p>
          <p>shows that schools are only interested in doing as little as possible.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And simply for the purpose of retaining accreditation to stay stay in business,</p>

          <p>Most people will have to fight to show that they know to get that next promotion,</p>

          <p>Or teachers can simply come up with the excuse, of not being able to test some fundamental of mathematics,</p>
          <p>because it was simply not covered, or; is yet to be covered by university education that not all maybe interested in.</p>

          <p>This would be somewhat OK, if this was some industry, or financial sector,</p>
