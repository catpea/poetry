          <p>People grow old only by deserting their ideals, MacArthur had written.</p>
          <p>Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up interest wrinkles the soul.</p>
          <p>You are as young as your faith, as old as your doubt; as young as your self-confidence, as old as your fear; as young as your hope as old as your despair.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>In the central place of every heart there is a recording chamber.</p>
          <p>So long as it receives messages of beauty, hope, cheer and courage, so long are you young.</p>
          <p>When your heart is covered with the snows of pessimism and the ice of cynicism, then, and then only, are you grown old.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>And then, indeed as the ballad says, you just fade away.</p>
