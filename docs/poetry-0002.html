        <section>
          <p>Don&apos;t aim at success.</p>
          <p>The more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it.</p>
          <p>For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side effect of one&apos;s personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one&apos;s surrender to a person other than oneself.</p>
          <p>Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it.</p>

        <section>
          <p>I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge.</p>
          <p>Then you will live to see that in the long-run&#x2014;in the long-run, I say! &#x2014; success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think about it.</p>
