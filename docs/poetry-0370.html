        <div class="section">
          <p>The longer the trail,</p>
          <p>the more distant our troubles become.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We gain a new perspective on our existence,</p>
          <p>and we begin to notice troubles that aren&apos;t real.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The morning alarm is not a useful invention,</p>
          <p>it is not even healthy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The job that pushed us into positions,</p>
          <p>that are not what we wanted, goes away.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>All those things that seem so crazy to give up,</p>
          <p>become replaced with the soft trail beneath our feet.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Worries about bears or mountain lions,</p>
          <p>all of a sudden become our biggest worry.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We open our eyes,</p>
          <p>to check if we can catch a glimpse of a flying squirrel, or an owl.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We synchronize with the sunrise and the sunset,</p>
          <p>and after a few weeks, the toxic stress begins leaving our body.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And then you notice your health,</p>
          <p>the rays of the sun, the fragrance of the pine trees.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And then it happens,</p>
          <p>it occurs to you like a storm occurs to a great lake.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Everyone has always pushed you into places that you didn&apos;t want to go,</p>
          <p>and to survive that strange life, you almost became somebody other than you really are.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It makes you a little bit angry,</p>
          <p>and a little bit sad, and plenty scared.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The trails,</p>
          <p>bring you back to the Magnificent Human that you really are.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>First they bring back your health, and your balance,</p>
          <p>they wash away your stress, you begin eating the right amounts of food.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Your muscles awaken, extra fat burns up,</p>
          <p>and your back stop hurting, you become more bouncy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You are being restored,</p>
          <p>you are healing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>An you slow down to match the speed of your heartbeat,</p>
          <p>and the sun, and the moon, and all the stars.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And you curiosity returns,</p>
          <p>it feels so good.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>On your way back from a quick re-supply trip,</p>
          <p>you notice more things, a used book store, an antique store.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And you find yourself looking for Robinson Crusoe,</p>
          <p>maybe a notepad, there are bits of sand in all you pockets, you brush it away from the counter, as you pay.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Chipmunks, you discover that chipmunks make sounds,</p>
          <p>that seagulls are incredibly silly.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And you GRUMBLE,</p>
          <p>never again.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is hard to describe what it means,</p>
          <p>never again will you let other people push you into what they need yo to be.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>To make their own lives easier,</p>
          <p>or just for no reason at all.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Eventually, in a matter of months,</p>
          <p>maybe a couple of years, you become full of nature, and it will never leave you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The trails, the beaches, the sands,</p>
          <p>the warmth of the ocean, the songs that little frogs sing become part of you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is no longer possible for you to sway for others,</p>
          <p>just of of your own natural density, dignity, nobility, authenticity, insight, and great health.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It won&apos;t take you long to figure out where things went wrong,</p>
          <p>a lot of the people in authority were using you, lying to you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You were young, and got used to being this blurry version of yourself,</p>
          <p>because you listened to what everyone was telling you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Now you have unshakable integrity,</p>
          <p>you are cheerful.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>From the hundreds and hundreds of books you&apos;ve read or listened to,</p>
          <p>since that sandy expedition to the used book store; you have inherited lifetimes of wisdom.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>What once seemed impossible becomes natural to you,</p>
          <p>you become a writer, artist, musician, story teller, great adventurer.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Books are written on many subjects,</p>
          <p>Astrophysics, Quantum Physics, Astrobiology, Philosophy, these represent a second level of knowledge.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>One that is above painting, or composing music,</p>
          <p>you discover new challenges, new curiosities.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And probably, worry about others who walk on a path that is not their own,</p>
          <p>you emerge an urge to help a world grow.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You want to spare others,</p>
          <p>what you went through.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Which brings me to the short answer,</p>
          <p>you were looking for.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The Journey has fueled countless stories and myths,</p>
          <p>sometimes the myths feature mazes that represent getting lost.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Sometimes, there are dragons or strange monsters,</p>
          <p>that represent trouble or a call to courage, or leadership.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Sometimes it is a mystical treasure that the adventurer seeks,</p>
          <p>only to discover that it wasn&apos;t some magical chalice or sword.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The magical chalice represented the transformation on the quest,</p>
          <p>and the superpowers, were all the powers we already had, but never used before.</p>
