          <p>Let me just say, becoming a programmer is very easy,</p>
          <p>you just need to stick your foot in the door.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>When I was little I was very fortunate to be introduced to the supremely user friendly Commodore 64,</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBV_ASCLF4w">you flip the switch and you get a prompt</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And you can immediately start programming,</p>
          <p>you also get what I call a cookbook, with very small and very clever, and useful recipes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Good recipes will help you dream a new program up,</p>
          <p>you&apos;ll be able to splice what you need together, out of the bits of the recipes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Do it a few times, for a couple of different programs,</p>
          <p>and you are a programmer.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Today, things are even easier,</p>
          <p>but you have to start in the right place.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>People will try to tell you about programming web applications, phone apps, internet of things,</p>
          <p>or making window applications, and stuff like using online programming environments - don&apos;t listen - start small and strong.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Start by writing a node.js based Linux program,</p>
          <p>for your Raspberry Pi.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Don&apos;t worry,</p>
          <p>you never start from scratch.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You start with an existing project,</p>
          <p>and then you modify it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>What project to start with?</p>
          <p>we&apos;ll create it, together, right now.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

        <div class="section">
          <p>Let us call it,</p>
          <p><a href="https://github.com/catpea/fragrance">fragrance</a> after a sophisticated french word.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The entry point is index.js, the main functions are stored in api.js, which is short for Application Programming Interface,</p>
          <p>and the little reusable functions sit in helpers.js.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The Raspberry Pi, that I recommend is the <a href="https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-4-complete-starter-kit.html">8GB Raspberry Pi 4 Complete Starter Kit</a>,</p>
          <p>but get a super fancy keyboard, an extra fast 64GB Class 10 MicroSD card, a couple of monitors, and an extra Micro HDMI Cable.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Don&apos;t forget to plug the fan into the 14th pin on the GPIO header,</p>
          <p>as that will let the operating system turn it on and off as needed.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You&apos;ll figure it all out,</p>
          <p>a little bit of discomfort is good when learning amazing new things.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Use <a href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm">nvm</a> to install node,</p>
          <p>and clone the <a href="https://github.com/catpea/fragrance">fragrance</a> get inside the fragrance directory, and execute ```npm link```.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It lets you install it as a Linux command,</p>
          <p>but you can still tinker with, it is like a local installation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Use grep to find all instances of the word fragrance,</p>
          <p>and change it to something nicer.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Later on as you get the hang of things,</p>
          <p>setup github, cret a new repository, clone it down, copy your files into it, and push it up into your github.</p>

          <p>And now we arrive at the title question,</p>
          <p>what are programs?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>They are your digital extensions,</p>
          <p>it cannot be said what programs do, because they do absolutely everything.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Your programs are your magic spells,</p>
          <p>whatever you want is just a few days of programming away.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You can&apos;t be told what you can do, there are cameras, robot arms, relay switches, chat bots, 2D and Text Games,</p>
          <p><a href="https://codemirror.net/6/">Code Editors</a> and visualization libraries like <a href="https://js.cytoscape.org/">Cytoscape.js</a> and <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3</a> there are no limits.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>To get a neat overview of what else is out there,</p>
          <p>search for <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs">Awesome node.js</a></p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But you can do,</p>
          <p>everything, on the server, in the web browser, in a window with <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">electron</a>, and on the Linux command line.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Your program library is no different than your tool drawer,</p>
          <p>where you keep your screwdriver, pliers, your trusty hammer.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You only write or use programs when you need them,</p>
          <p>if you are interested in learning how to program, search the internet for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=node+js+tutorial">node.js tutorials</a> to get a better picture.</p>
