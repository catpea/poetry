        <div class="section">
          <p>So today, I will show you how to compose your own songs,</p>
          <p>with your own lyrics.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We have a talent that you may not be aware of,</p>
          <p>it is the talent of synchronizing with a metronome, or a simple beat.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Here, you just turn in on for one minute,</p>
          <p>and then come up with a thought that moves you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And then try to speak your wave-like-thought,</p>
          <p>in the mathematically square melody of the metronome or the beat.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If something goes wrong, and your song isn&apos;t coming together,</p>
          <p>you will need a melody to guide you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Come up with your own,</p>
          <p>just while something to a beat.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And then when you get stuck with lyrics,</p>
          <p>coming apart on you, return to composing a thought to your whistle, your root melody.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You must use your own lyrics,</p>
          <p>you must use your own thoughts.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You can speak from your heart,</p>
          <p>but you have to use short words.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Because if you use really long words,</p>
          <p>then the song is going to sound really strange.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But you can use them in a way, so as long as you split them up,</p>
          <p>try your luck with &quot;met-ro-nome&quot;, it doesn&apos;t always sound that bad.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But creating lyrics,</p>
          <p>is about finding a path trough a maze.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>So if a word does not fit right,</p>
          <p>then find one that will shine some light.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Here is a little example:</p>
          <p>*recursive example...*</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

        <div class="section">
          <p>Here is a short song I made out of the titles and thoughts behind my recent poems,</p>
          <p>I must warn you, this is not a masterpiece.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But, this is <a href="/audio/trying-to-sing.mp3">the first song I sing on my own</a>,</p>
          <p>next time, I will spend some more time on the lyrics.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I will come up with a melody,</p>
          <p>that the lyrics will click with.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And I&apos;ll combine the lyrics with the drum in the back,</p>
          <p>so that as the big drum hits, the lyric will hit too.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>My voice here has no special filtering,</p>
          <p>it just has some big-room re-verb, and I sung a tone lower.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I don&apos;t have a very good piano here,</p>
          <p>the few things I tried sounded miserable, so I ended up using an old synthesizer.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But, I recommend using Piano and Violin,</p>
          <p>it would make things sound much nicer.</p>
        </div>
