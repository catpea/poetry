          <p>With each little triumph, we add to our treasures,</p>
          <p>and it grows over time, it grows beyond measures.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Sometimes, it all starts in loneliness,</p>
          <p>but it quickly fills up as it reaches silliness.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And so, we carry our fancy treasure chest,</p>
          <p>we take it with us on every quest.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>It is not possible for it to get lost,</p>
          <p>and nobody else can touch it - at any cost.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>In no way could it ever be sacrificed,</p>
          <p>and no robbers could ever stage a big enough heist.</p>

          <p>Little chest in a safe place deep in our heart,</p>
          <p>it serves to light the fire that fuels our art.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>It prevents us from walking in reverse,</p>
          <p>it helps to make our existence more diverse.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>It also adds a great deal unto our beauty,</p>
          <p>as it drives us to create out of love, and not mere duty.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>All those petite little things that make us proud,</p>
          <p>also make us stand out in a crowd.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>So it also serves as a lighthouse with a bright beam</p>
          <p>that lights the way betwixt us, and our dream.</p>

        <section>
          <p>I think one reason why nobody ever mentions it,</p>
          <p>is because it is too sacred, to just talk about it.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>But I want to remind you, my Dear Friends,</p>
          <p>that sometimes we need to look through this lens.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Your treasure chest will show you,</p>
          <p>a picture of you that is most true.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Oh, don&apos;t worry if you have only one thing,</p>
          <p>it is still a treasure, it still makes you a Queen or King.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>We all have a few simple treasures when we start,</p>
          <p>but they grow as we use our heart to turn our life to art.</p>
