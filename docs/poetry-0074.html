          <p>It was a very rainy day,</p>
          <p>the sky was completely gray.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I took a nap come afternoon,</p>
          <p>fell into my bed with a big swoon.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I woke up rested, and ran to the door,</p>
          <p>but it only seemed to rain more.</p>

          <p>I resumed my endurance training a week back,</p>
          <p>It was a warm-up week, so I ran like a Mac truck.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I actually sprinted yesterday,</p>
          <p>somewhat frightening myself along the way.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I felt like I was all muscle,</p>
          <p>I moved like red lightening, without a hustle.</p>

          <p>Even though yesterday I ran in the rain,</p>
          <p>I rained only a bit, so I had to train.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Today, the rain seemed like too much trouble,</p>
          <p>I rested, but tomorrow I&apos;ll have to train double.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I always tell people not to rest,</p>
          <p>let Mother Mature decide, she knows best.</p>
