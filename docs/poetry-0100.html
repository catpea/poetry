          <p>I sprayed myself with sunscreen today,</p>
          <p>grabbed my bicycle, and went on my way.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And then,</p>
          <p>all of a sudden!</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I thought I was attacked by some angry bees,</p>
          <p>it turned out to be a mosquito who got me twice, in both knees.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>To be fair, I wore my new short pants to be trendy,</p>
          <p>but the little sucker didn&apos;t need to get me where I am so bendy.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>It itched all the way back home with each turn of the bicycle wheel,</p>
          <p>... it was indeed a very itchy ordeal.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>When I finally got home, I took a vitamin,</p>
          <p>and on each knee; I squirted a bit of anti-histamine.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I sat there a bit, wondering &quot;Why me?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Why get me twice in each knee?&quot;</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>To be honest, until I realized that&apos;s simply where my new pants ended,</p>
          <p>I was feeling pretty gosh darn offended.</p>
