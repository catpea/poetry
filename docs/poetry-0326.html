          <p>Everything we touch must advance forward,</p>
          <p>it is just how life works.</p>

          <p>This does not mean that we jog,</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It means that we identify what stopped us yesterday,</p>
          <p>and understand it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And rise above it,</p>

          <p>Everything that surrounds us,</p>
          <p>wants to burst out in colors.</p>

          <p>But if all we do is stop,</p>
          <p>and never try..</p>

          <p>Songs are a good example of that,</p>
          <p>they are full of color, patters, and energy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You just need to slow down,</p>
          <p>to hear what they are made out of.</p>

          <p>And see how they are just fast enough,</p>
          <p>to bring you joy, but not the building plans beneath.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Until you can hear the kicks, claps, hats, ambiance, melody and bass,</p>
          <p>and take it apart, and make a note of all the pieces.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And stop, stop, listening to other people&apos;s song,</p>
          <p>and begin making your own songs that others may listen to.</p>

          <p>All the intricate details of all the wonders around us,</p>

          <p>The teachers won&apos;t help you understand any of it,</p>
          <p>it is you who must reach out, pencil in hand.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is the same for everything,</p>
          <p>from quantum physics, to dance songs, abstract art and oil painting.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This is one of the biggest gifts of life,</p>
          <p>understanding the beauty around us, and maybe creating some more.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We won&apos;t understand everything all at once, only one precious step at a time,</p>
          <p>and that is both what it takes to start, and what it takes to get to the finish line.</p>
