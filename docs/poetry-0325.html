        <div class="section">
          <p>Music Theory is not something you learn or study,</p>
          <p>it is something you independently invent.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Music theory contains a very important lesson,</p>
          <p>there is an infinity within.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You can spend a life inventing music,</p>
          <p>but you have to stop yourself, to live one.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Similarly, you can spend a lifetime</p>
          <p>trying to create photo-realistic paintings.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But it is best to let the brush be a brush,</p>
          <p>and let the paining say that it is a painting.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The perfection of a painting</p>
          <p>is found in the rays of the sun it contains.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The perfection of a song,</p>
          <p>is found in the way it makes a dancer&apos;s body move.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>To sit down with sound synthesizers</p>
          <p>is more about meditation than composition.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>There are libraries of pre-made sounds out there,</p>
          <p>and it is not a terrible thing to use them.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Just like it is better to learn to make songs,</p>
          <p>by trying to replicate existing ones.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is better to learn about good sound synthesis,</p>
          <p>by making use of pre made sounds or sample.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The samples that you fall in love with,</p>
          <p>will call to you, and eventually you&apos;ll recreate them.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Once you create a really good song that connects with you,</p>
          <p>you can then re-synthesize your own version of the sounds within.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Music is about having fun, it is about creating beautiful things,</p>
          <p>it is not about slaving over bare bone sound synthesis.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is important to keep in mind that sharing fun, is even more fun,</p>
          <p>songs that help people dance, may just be the loveliest kind of songs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Let us make a strange little dance song,</p>
          <p>out of existing sound samples.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We&apos;ll use the sounds found in</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lTZ8Tuyu5I">Sam Aaron</a>&apos;s Sonic Pi project.</p>
        </div>

          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is not a bad idea to start with the Rhythm of the song first,</p>
          <p>the rhythm is like a foundation onto which we can add Harmony and Melody.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If we started with Melody first,</p>
          <p>the melody would not tell us much about the rhythm of the song.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Starting with rhythm we can get our foot tapping,</p>
          <p>and those taps will dictate how that melody will move.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Using ready made samples</p>
          <p>we can instantly get a nice drum setup going.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>*song plays*</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And then sprinkle in a bit of hats, or cymbals,</p>
          <p>now to be fair, we got to get our shoes on, and dance it out.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>A dance song must always be tested,</p>
          <p>against the type of dancing that it will be used for.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Here are the fist three sections,</p>
          <p>a clumsy intro, a cymbal free beat, and then the initial enchilada.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>*song plays*</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is at 130 beats per minute, and it is reasonably danceable,</p>
          <p>it is nothing too special, but it is a danceable rhythm.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We can bend it a little bit,</p>
          <p>but we have to mindful of our dancer.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>They are currently meditating to our song,</p>
          <p>and we must not interrupt their mediation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Or they&apos;ll skip the song,</p>
          <p>and later remove the song from their play list.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is a sad fact of life,</p>
          <p>that no matter how good our song is.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It will stop being catchy to the dancer,</p>
          <p>in less than 30 days.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>There is nothing you can do,</p>
          <p>your song will expire like produce.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>While we are on the dancer&apos;s mind,</p>
          <p>we can bring them some joy by alternating moods as the song progresses.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Let us create a more intense mood in what we have so far,</p>
          <p>by adding bass.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Bass is still a low frequency sound like the drums,</p>
          <p>but it is less percussive (as in hitting a drum) and more stretched as in a whistle.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>One common example of bass is a bass guitar,</p>
          <p>it is low and deep, but unlike the drum the sound it makes is long.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Let me take a moment and explain how melodies,</p>
          <p>including bass, as bass guitar usually plays simple melody get created.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The rule of melody making is keep it simple and sweet,</p>
          <p>and I am not joking about this.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The creation is so simple that all we need to create a melody,</p>
          <p>is dots and lines.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Moreover, it almost does not matter how the dots and lines are arranged,</p>
          <p>so as long as they go up and down a little bit.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>(Just to clarify, the dots and lines I am referring to, represent long ans short sounds,</p>
          <p>is basically what you would see on an cowboy era automatic-player-piano sheet.)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Let us go over to a text to Morse code translator,</p>
          <p>and convert the word meow to Morse code for our melody.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>*beeps play*</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This does not sound very good because it is the same note,</p>
          <p>it is as boring as whistling the same tone:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>*whistle -- / . / --- / .--*</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>So let us very gently vary the notes used in our melody here,</p>
          <p>just gently going left and right with our finger on the piano.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>When making melodies, you can skip two keys, maybe three,</p>
          <p>but don&apos;t make a huge jump of four notes, because then you have to search for notes that go well together.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Interestingly enough if you have a piano handy and never played it,</p>
          <p>you can easily improvise a song by pressing a key to a tempo, and then just gently moving left and right.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>As a bonus try to keep rhythm with the low frequency keys on your left,</p>
          <p>that will be your &quot;piano drum&quot; and your right hand will give the melody.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>As an extra bonus try pressing two or three keys at the same time to create a chord,</p>
          <p>this will make a richer sound - you&apos;ll probably make a better song than I am making right now...</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Here is what our Morse code melody sounds like, in low bass,</p>
          <p>with a couple of gentle changes to sync it up top the back beat.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>*song plays*</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>and here it is with drums:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>*song plays*</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Remember, that all the samples you are using, are uniquely stacked together,</p>
          <p>very few other songs will use the same bass sample, with whatever you put on top of it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The way to think about bass is this:</p>
          <p>a fuzzy and furry container for higher pitched melodies.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It almost has the same result as hall effect has on old school computer chip tunes,</p>
          <p>but here you are not relying on an echo to blend beeps into something richer,</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You are relying on hand picked bass sample, or even a real guitar,</p>
          <p>and there ain&apos;t no nothing wrong with that.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>So now that we have the beat, the hat/cymbals, and the bass,</p>
          <p>we now need to add that melody that goes on top of the bass, that will melt into the bass.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Now, before we you add a melody, you need to take a breath of fresh air,</p>
          <p>we can&apos;t pretend that music creation is a science, it is a exploratory and generative process.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>So we have to listen, and understand to the soul of the song we have just created,</p>
          <p>my use of the Morse code, is kind of already whispering something.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>When you really listen to the melody our Morse code created,</p>
          <p>it sounds Russian.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We have to listen to the song,</p>
          <p>the song is dictating a certain path through a maze of infinite complexity.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In this situation,</p>
          <p>I went <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/connect/sounds/index.html">NASA&apos;s website</a> and borrowed the sound of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_(rocket)">&#x421;&#x43F;&#x443;&#x442;&#x43D;&#x438;&#x43A; (&#x440;&#x430;&#x43A;&#x435;&#x442;&#x430;-&#x43D;&#x43E;&#x441;&#x438;&#x442;&#x435;&#x43B;&#x44C;)</a></p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And our little Sputnik gives us melody,</p>
          <p>here is what it sounds like.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>*song plays*</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>At this point we have a tird of a song,</p>
          <p>it is not a bad idea to end the song, with a variation on the begining, without ading anything new.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>So that gives us about a minute and a half,</p>
          <p>and we only need about 60 more seconds, as our dancer has better songs to dance to.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Since our song wants to be russion, let us grab a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Russian_Man_signoff_2013-04-23.ogg">recording of an old russian number station from wikipedia</a>,</p>
          <p>and sprinkle in a bit more more sputnik at the end.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I chose to decorate the center of the song with a piano,</p>
          <p>as that will pleasantly surprise our dancer.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Overall the songe ended up being very tanky,</p>
          <p>but it is dancable.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If I had to do something differently,</p>
          <p>it would be spending more time replicationg and studying othr songs to make the song less Heavy Industries and more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Cutting+Shapes+Dance">Cutting Shapes</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In closing, Building songs should not rely on a pre-set recipe,</p>
          <p>it is a creative process that should invole lots of randomness and pleanty of dancing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
