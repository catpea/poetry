          <p>Any adventure,</p>
          <p>is an adventure.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>You don&apos;t have to go far,</p>
          <p>though walking will be involved.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>Adventures within adventures,</p>
          <p>are even more fun.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>That&apos;s where you go somewhere,</p>
          <p>and then explore something else from there.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>It is like going to Ludington,</p>
          <p>but then marching around Nordhouse Dunes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>Or visiting White Fish Point,</p>
          <p>and then trying to find fossils on the beach.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>Or even going to the mall with your friends,</p>
          <p>and then just people watching instead.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>One definition of tiny adventures,</p>
          <p>is going somewhere and then learning something new.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>But you see, in this modern age we live in now,</p>
          <p>this is a lot more exciting than it sounds, because of Audio Books.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>Though you maybe walking to the store for a change,</p>
          <p>your Audio Book, may transport you to the Appalachian Trail.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>There are other things that can spice up your adventures,</p>
          <p>it all depends how creative you are.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>For example, back in January 2014,</p>
          <p>during the gorgeous -16 Fahrenheit Polar Vortex weather in Michigan.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>With all the warnings as not to go outside,</p>
          <p>and stay home, and drink hot chocolate.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>I put on all my clothes, all at once,</p>
          <p>and hurried out, for an hour-and-a-half-long expedition.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>I wasn&apos;t in want for anything,</p>
          <p>so I figured I might as well get some little beef jerky sausages.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>It didn&apos;t seem as cold as everyone made it out to be,</p>
          <p>but it did make my sausages; as frosty, as my little adventure fantastic.</p>
