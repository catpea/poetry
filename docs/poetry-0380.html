          <p>It won&apos;t be as easy,</p>
          <p>as a walk in the park.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Because you need an edge,</p>
          <p>an Ocean, a Sea, or a Great Lake.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is best to set off for a body of water,</p>
          <p>that has nothing on the horizon.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This is what an edge is,</p>
          <p>a starting point.</p>
        </div>

          <p>Ludington State Park is the nearest edge to where I live,</p>
          <p>you need to start away from big cities and parking lots.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And you need to dive a little,</p>
          <p>it has to be a ride towards wilderness.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>An you need options,</p>
          <p>the state park allows you to park your car and head towards Nordhouse.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is always good,</p>
          <p>to have a more advanced level near by.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You never know when you change your mind about camping at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/vWqnC3NnBSZYWmrGA">hike-in sites</a>,</p>
          <p>and search for something bigger or less Raccoony.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Though always remember, out in the wilderness,</p>
          <p>Raccoons are family, and they know how to unzip tents, so bring a little padlock.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Hang your food down from a line attached to a tall branch on a tree,</p>
          <p>goodness knows... they need a workout.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>

        <div class="section">
          <p>For me, in the beginning, a mile long walk to the <a href="https://www2.dnr.state.mi.us/ParksandTrails/Details.aspx?id=168&amp;type=SPCG">Jack Pine hike-in sites</a> with my backpack on,</p>
          <p>was good, not too long and not too short.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The hike-in sites are away from the entire State Park Kerfuffle,</p>
          <p>but they are not too lonely, and have water and rustic restrooms.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Once you hop over the dune,</p>
          <p>you see the endless horizon.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And a distant lighthouse, just about a mile north, sells knickknacks,</p>
          <p>and M&amp;Ms, and offers a proper bench to sit on.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And if you keep going due north just about another 4.1 miles,</p>
          <p>you&apos;ll get to the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/yEjfkpDshPNVegq78">end point of the southern Nordhouse Nurnberg trail</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You can actually drive to the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/wzXUKQr7AhmTQqQw7">Nurnberg Trail Head</a> and there is a neat parking lot there,</p>
          <p>again rustic restrooms, a bunch of cars, sometimes you may need to park along the road.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And if you park right before the permit required area,</p>
          <p>the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/AL1Z2k7ThQ6ajmDD6">parking is free</a>, people park there for days though make sure that this is still the case.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is a mile long walk from the Nurnberg Trail Head parking lot,</p>
          <p>to the beach and all the sites, but it is a paradise, and no Raccoons.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Nuremberg is a gravel road, if that is not for you than take the paved <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/uavgj5pSmW396DUJ7">West Forest Trail Road</a>,</p>
          <p>and keep an eye out for that left turn or you will end up in that pretty day camp area.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Once you get to the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/R2M8RbYSftjvgqHx9">end of West Forest Trail Road</a>,</p>
          <p>there is plenty of parking (32 spots), and then you have to walk the Arrow Head Nature Trail south to the Nordhouse boundary.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>There is also a very large camping area here for campers,</p>
          <p>and cars, where you can camp next to your car, the bathrooms and showers are nice.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This camping area is not a state park, it is privately owned,</p>
          <p>it is mostly people in campers just spending their summers in the woods.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Just to clarify, there are two access sites for driving into Nordhouse,</p>
          <p>one via the paved West Forest Trail Road, and the other via the Nurnberg gravel road for nature geeks.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And that is a pretty good start of camping adventures,</p>
          <p>bring your books and journals, and some books about learning how to draw.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You can start camping in a tent by your car,</p>
          <p>at a nice site with a fire place, at the State Park.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Then, you can move on the the Jack Pine hike-in sites,</p>
          <p>and then Nordhouse, be it by Nurnberg or West Forest Trail Road.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It may not be perfect to be five or six miles away from your car by foot,</p>
          <p>so don&apos;t walk to Nordhouse from the State Park, just drive there, at first to Forest Trail Road, and later Nurnberg Road.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Don&apos;t forget the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/GmftgFifmwkzzHKu7">gas station</a>,</p>
          <p>it has chocolates, ice cream, and sausages.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This is a very gentle on-ramp for getting comfortable,</p>
          <p>with the woods, and backpacks, and figuring out what you need in your backpack.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Some people do all their hiking here,</p>
          <p>they come in a couple of times a year stay a couple of weeks, and regain their strength.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Lake Michigan makes a huge difference,</p>
          <p>you are not just camping in the woods, the beach is a minute away.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It takes the endless horizon, in combination with hiking and camping to hear the call of the wild,</p>
          <p>once you hear it, you bring it with you wherever you go.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You will never let anybody overwork you again for any reason,</p>
          <p>you will gain insight into the world by means of a simple external perspective.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>A simple insight goes a long way,</p>
          <p>you&apos;ll begin seeing what the unimportant or fake things are, like promotions, or grades or GPAs, or diplomas.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If you ever lost touch with your Genius, or Greatness, or even Childhood Dreams,</p>
          <p>they are all at the edge of your universe waiting for you to Rest, and Remember.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I&apos;ll close with what Henry once wrote,</p>
          <p>about his own stay by a lake.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>&quot;I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately,</p>
          <p>to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach,</p>
          <p>and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I did not wish to live what was not life,</p>
          <p>living is so dear;</p>
          <p>nor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life,</p>
          <p>to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life,</p>
          <p>to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms...&quot;</p>
