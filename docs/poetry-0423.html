          <p>Conscious life is a magnificent accident on such an impossibly large scale,</p>
          <p>that it becomes the single most important miracle in the universe.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You, I, all the other Earthlings,</p>
          <p>and all the other conscious life out there: we are the meaning of this universe.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We are all connected with this incredible feat of emergence; Consciousness,</p>
          <p>it does not matter where we come from or how we look - if we can see ourselves - we are Family.</p>

          <p>Our minds were crafted by an adaptive process,</p>
          <p>that step by step, improved on the previous.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The steps were not aimed at anything in particular,</p>
          <p>and are far from perfect.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But consciousness is something different,</p>
          <p>it is not random, it is not a function of mere adaptive mechanics of accidents, and fundamental principles.</p>

          <p>Consciousness allows us to deliberately and in foresight, cross the line between mere evolution,</p>
          <p>onward into Freedom of Will, Love Of Life, and Power of Knowledge, and Light Of Wisdom; and Love, Good Will, and Lasting Peace brought on by Greatness of Vision, Heart and Spirit.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We must deliberately aim to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases">push away the flaws that the meanderings of nature instilled in us</a>,</p>
          <p>by the countless accidents of the process of our initial emergence as conscious beings.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If we don&apos;t detach,</p>
          <p>our minds will be held back by racism, xenophobia, nationalism, group-think, fear, hate, and blindness.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We will point Nuclear Weapons at each other,</p>
          <p>and list the flags of our enemies as if it was a checklist for advancement.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>What may seem like a soap opera news program to the educated,</p>
          <p>can be perceived as reality and opportunity to the poor, starving or disadvantaged, who did not know to seek real education.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We have introduced a device of deliberate advancement for all Human Beings,</p>
          <p>that device was supposed to pull us towards a Wiser State of Existence.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But its aim was lost, it was an experiment that has never fully reached its goal,</p>
          <p>and ended up being used by the poor, as means to put food on the table.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>That noble experiment.</p>
          <p>was organized education.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Today it may cost as much as a million dollars or more and in unforgivable student loans,</p>
          <p>to become a medical expert.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Don&apos;t bother trying to understand why schools failed, there is no time,</p>
          <p>simply accept the responsibility for your own education, and begin immediately.</p>

          <p>There are many flaws in our perception,</p>
          <p>the biggest one is our tendency to follow leaders.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But the act of following, is an act of destruction,</p>
          <p>we are each to lead, we are never to follow, ever.</p>

          <p>Self education by means of reading or listening to books held in high esteem by the world&apos;s most prominent intellectuals,</p>
          <p>paves the road towards a balanced and enlightened view of the world, and the view of our place in it.</p>

          <p>All the people that hate, that want to cause harm, are just ill from lack of growing up, from lack of education,</p>
          <p>from standing in-place, without ever knowing to reach for books, for wisdom, and for greatness.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>When we stand in the place that we are born into,</p>
          <p>we come under the control of the flaws, that consciousness, easily allows us to escape.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You must withstand the culture you are born into, the neighborhood you are born into,</p>
          <p>the poverty you are born into, be it of mind, or wallet, or both.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You must resist the urge of belonging, cheaply and effortlessly,</p>
          <p>as that is the oldest recruitment mechanism to make a slave - to turn a young person, old and bitter.</p>
