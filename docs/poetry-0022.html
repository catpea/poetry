        <section>
          <p>Found two bugs in code, and got stuck in between.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I was supposed to be working on a Sound Machine,</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>but spent the noon formatting the code to keep it clean.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I can&apos;t believe, there is a bug in my code,</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>its probably in octicons, because I am using node.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Worst of all, I can&apos;t see it fail until I publish,</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>because sapper likes static as not to be sluggish.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>So here I am, finally dressed up like Superman,</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Debugging code, blind, like a veritable caveman.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I did a bit of soul searching,</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>then followed with some researching.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Now, I am sitting here, contemplating if I need a cape,</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>wondering if I should follow up with an Audiotape.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I could finish up getting in shape,</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>and completely change the workout landscape.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I am serious about making a workout tape,</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I really want to get in shape.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>What if the workout required wearing a tail?</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Would it become like super holy grail?</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I would walk the street and people would pale,</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>&quot;Sir! Why have you done this?</p>
        </section>
