          <p>A World torn apart by borders,</p>
          <p>is a broken world full of dark secrets.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>The world can&apos;t progress forward,</p>
          <p>if we are not learning.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Observations are very important,</p>
          <p>but they are not on a large enough scale.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>We need a steady stream from multiple reinforcing sources,</p>
          <p>Audio Books and Lectures are exactly that kind of stream.</p>

          <p>They are integrated works of art,</p>
          <p>tightly compressed, well arranged.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>If you are lucky it will be read by the author,</p>
          <p>the chapters will flow together with feeling, pride and joy.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>If you find a Memoir, or Travel/Adventure book, that makes you rest, that you enjoy, that makes you smirk.</p>
          <p>You are bound to permanently inherit massive amount of knowledge, it really does not matter what the book is about.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Any story story you love can only add to you, it will reinforce you, make you better and stronger.</p>

          <p>Our first great achievement is reaching out for Knowledge and Wisdom,</p>
          <p>and the reward is a Greater Mind.</p>

          <p>Every person is capable of becoming, Profound and Wise,</p>
          <p>it takes effort, it is a deliberate, volitional act.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>If a person does not know: how big the world is,</p>
          <p>they will never leave their city, or their small mind, behind.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>We have to learn to slow down,</p>
          <p>and live at such a speed that does not interfere with our inheritance of wisdom.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>We can&apos;t deny ourselves knowledge,</p>
          <p>and then run quickly forward.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Without constantly expanding your knowledge,</p>
          <p>we may not be able to tell, which way forward, is.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Inheriting from lives and wisdom of other people, is a great super power.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And accepting responsibility for self education, is easily of of the greatest things we&apos;ll ever do.</p>

          <p>Finally, the answer to that stupid question that people ask us when we are little,</p>
          <p>&quot;What do you want to be when you grow up?&quot;,</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Must not conjure up a picture of some career path.</p>
          <p>There is only one correct answer, and it should be the same for us all:</p>

        <section>
          <p>&quot;I want to Become a Wise Being&quot;</p>

          <p>Only in our wisdom can the World grow,</p>
          <p>and especially in the wisdom of the youngest generation.</p>
