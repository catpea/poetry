          <p>Consciousness is not as simple as it seems,</p>
          <p>because to think, also means to out-think.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Political liars, for example,</p>
          <p>tend to out-think voters.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Political analysts worth their salt,</p>
          <p>not only out-think voters, but also out-think the out-thinking of voters.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The writers of Space Operas that span countless generations of characters,</p>
          <p>take this to a, fantastic maximum.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>To think, is to be able to out think,</p>
          <p>and there is no limit to how far you can go.</p>

          <p>Scientists invented a rule, where in terms of realism,</p>
          <p>&quot;If you can&apos;t prove it, it does not exist.&quot;.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Conspiracy theorists, in their tendency to ignore rules,</p>
          <p>are a good example of how one can leap out of reality.</p>

          <p>Beings that are Conscious, and aware of their surroundings,</p>
          <p>who capable of choosing what to do next, create a Universal Family.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s1qTUqOv88">Wonderful Scientists</a> suspect,</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But we have to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtIyx687ytk">pay attention to Choice</a>,</p>
          <p>because that too is a bit tricky.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>There is this small problem, where we tend to believe,</p>
          <p>what people in authority tell us.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If our view of the world is not set in reality,</p>
          <p>then our freedom of will, stand on uneven ground.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Without truth, and clarity of vision,</p>

          <p>There is no one to blame for Humanity&apos;s Greatest mistakes,</p>

          <p>When we _do_ take to wisdom,</p>
          <p>the clarity of our vision and the freedom of our will greatly improves.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>As great of a superpower that Consciousness is, I think we have to consider Consciousness without Wisdom,</p>
          <p>Consciousness without clarity of vision, Consciousness without the stability of Truth, as a problem that we should each quickly solve.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>A Planet wide problem, especially now that we face Climate Change, Holocene Extinction,</p>
          <p>and the presence of some 16,000 nuclear weapons spread across nine nations, who do not aim to converge on wisdom, and will diverge on political and religious issues.</p>

          <p>I know that some of you think little of humanity for what it has done to you, and the promises it has broken,</p>

          <p>Though you may not care about Humanity,</p>
