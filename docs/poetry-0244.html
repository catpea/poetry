          <p>Some secrets are right there,</p>
          <p>in the sand, they lay bare.</p>

          <p>For a few days,</p>
          <p>I, manned that blaze.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>I lit a fire so great,</p>
          <p>that it moved me, to create.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>I didn&apos;t have much in my tent,</p>
          <p>in my wallet, I didn&apos;t have a singe cent.</p>

          <p>I lived in a castle, built by a gigantic dune,</p>
          <p>its halls hummed that ancient tune.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>In the day I&apos;d gather firewood,</p>
          <p>come the eve I&apos;d have a potato, that tasted so good.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I neither searched for a beginning nor the end,</p>
          <p>I merely wanted to find idea&apos;s edge, to my own content.</p>

          <p>It was right there,</p>
          <p>but it was not in the horizon, nor the fire&apos;s flare.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>It was in living at a proper pace,</p>
          <p>and sleeping in the right place.</p>

          <p>Composing Music and Painting Art,</p>
          <p>are unique and worlds apart.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In art we race to paint,</p>

          <p>Each requires a different place,</p>

          <p>sadly, they will never finish their painting, or their song.</p>

          <p>And when it was time go back whence I came,</p>
          <p>I rolled up my tent, and put out the flame.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Somebody else down the trail, instantly lit another fire,</p>
          <p>and pondered their own wisdom, to their own desire.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>I waddled back, my painted walking stick in hand,</p>
          <p>slowly marking notes, beats, and measures in the sand.</p>
