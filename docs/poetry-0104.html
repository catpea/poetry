          <p>Authenticity would be Wonderful on its own,</p>
          <p>it helps with trust, admiration, knowing, feeling.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>But, actually, it is far more than that,</p>
          <p>it reflects Fundamental Principles of The Universe.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>There is a very big difference, between crossing a real bridge,</p>
          <p>and a fake one.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Or, reading a book for real, and pretending to read.</p>
          <p>Or, studying a Field of Science and, and cramming for a test.</p>
          <p>Or, doing something for a grade, and doing something for your mind.</p>
          <p>Or, doing something for real, and pretend to do something.</p>
          <p>Or, being your complete self, and being what others approve of.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>The one thing in common here, is one is a fantasy that ends,</p>
          <p>and the other, just is ... and grows, and alters the course of life ahead.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>It is a testament to our connection with the Universe,</p>
          <p>that an Authentic Human Being will grow Healthy and Strong, and Keep Expanding.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>The best example of this is getting an education that looks great on paper,</p>
          <p>but does nothing for interacting with the real word.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>A similar example has to do with a great job that pays well, that goes great,</p>
          <p>but halts a person&apos;s development, and robs them of their youth, dreams, and hopes,</p>
          <p>robs them of the highest version of themselves.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Time, cannot be warped, or faked,</p>
          <p>it ticks away, our bodies grow, day by day, year by year, decade by decade.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>The long-vision of becoming of ourselves, will reveal that the first and foremost,</p>
          <p>and most dominant and meaningful thing, is our acquisition of wisdom.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Acquisition of Wisdom is deeply connected to Authenticity,</p>
          <p>Courage, Dignity, Nobility, Pursuit of Knowledge, Rising, Growing Up.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Time helps our bodies progress forward,</p>
          <p>but it is Wisdom that helps our Minds.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Authenticity, gives us this incredible power to start something today,</p>
          <p>that will make us Wiser, Healthier, Happier, Filled with More Insight.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And not merely tomorrow, but for all our time to come,</p>
          <p>as in Authenticity, each day adds to the previous.</p>
