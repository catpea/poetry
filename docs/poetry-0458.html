          <p>Most of us ignore the idea of genius,</p>
          <p>because nothing profound can come from it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But we needn&apos;t be like that,</p>
          <p>we are all geniuses.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Genius is a state that we can all easily make our way into,</p>
          <p>it requires rest, a happy place, and Happiness.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is a state that we should live-in; for a long time,</p>
          <p>little notebook in back pocket, that trusty old mechanical pencil.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is a state of cheerfulness and serenity,</p>
          <p>peacefulness and long, long, looooooooooooong thoughts.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Sometimes it is not easy to reach that state,</p>
          <p>life gets busy and sometimes sad.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But sadness has its place in happiness too,</p>
          <p>and no one is granted the right to stay permanently unhappy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>For those of us who struggle to get there, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPSvdKTEZug">long nature trails</a>, were invented to serve as a quick emergency access point,</p>
          <p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/US_National_Trails_System%2C_50th_Anniversary_map.jpg">and they are everywhere</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_longest_cross-country_trails">all over the world</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>All you need is a loaf of bread,</p>
          <p>and some bug spray.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>When we are little, parents remind us that we are not to follow,</p>
          <p>with that curiously morbid &quot;If everyone was jumping out of the window, would you jump out too?&quot;</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But we get caught up in life,</p>
          <p>chasing promotions and paychecks, mortgage payments, and student loan debt.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But we can&apos;t say that we are ourselves when we are in that state,</p>
          <p>and when you really think about it...</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We aren&apos;t really doing anybody any service,</p>
          <p>by being constantly overworked and over-worried, and generally being other than we really are.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Those who care about us,</p>
          <p>expect us to be who we really are at all times, they care because they appreciate who we are.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Overwork, stress, chasing promotions, quotas,</p>
          <p>diplomas, patents, deadlines, and all that hard work... needs to be pushed all the way in the back.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We _must be_ who we really are,</p>
          <p>because that is how we grow.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We should never fall behind on growing up,</p>
          <p>not for a day, not for an hour.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Our beauty depends on always moving onward,</p>
          <p>and always bettering ourselves.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Our natural instinct is to always cheerfully advance forward,</p>
          <p>in pursuit of our curiosities and dreams.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>That is what the state of genius really is,</p>
          <p>finding comfort and balance in advancing forward in life.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>As we each take to unique curiosities and paths,</p>
          <p>our genius too, grows unique.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>There is no real definition of genius,</p>
          <p>because no two people are the same.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But we know that is is precious and sweet,</p>
          <p>and irreplaceable, and worth the while.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In a way it is something that outlines the presence of the person that shares it with us,</p>
          <p>and should the person quit sharing we, almost instantly, long for more.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And the same goes for us, when we set off on that great adventure, and return to tell the story,</p>
          <p>our listeners will be sure to wish for more.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Take good care care of your genius and adventure,</p>
          <p>don&apos;t forget about your neat and interesting curiosities, as they pave a way forward towards accomplishment, cheerfulness and serenity.</p>
