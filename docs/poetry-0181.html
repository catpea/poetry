          <p>If the world had an enemy,</p>
          <p>its greatest weapon would be the control of the level of knowledge,</p>
          <p>and control of what is allowed to be known.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Even without an enemy, we fall into the trap of unknowing, all on our own,</p>
          <p>..and we make, what we discover later on to be, wrong decisions.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>While we are making those decisions,</p>
          <p>we are certainly making them with goodness in mind,</p>
          <p>but without knowledge, good intentions may indeed, pave a way to hell.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>This is something that has been known for thousands of years,</p>
          <p>control of what is known is the evil behind slavery,</p>
          <p>it is the evil behind manufactured consent.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And anything, that stands in the way of real education,</p>
          <p>even broken schools, should be seen as an attack,</p>
          <p>the theft of our intellectual inheritance.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Real Education must be seen as one of our Greatest Rights,</p>
          <p>as a Great Treasure, a Great Honor, and Great Reward.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Failure to see that, is a sign that something has gone wrong,</p>
          <p>and it is time to begin reading books on your own.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Be mindful of schools that are not educating you,</p>
          <p>find your way to the library, read all the books that help you,</p>
          <p>drop out, and carry on in Relentless Pursuit of Knowledge.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Know with full certainty,</p>
          <p>that Dysfunctional Education, Neutered Education,</p>
          <p>Education that fails to help you become Wise,</p>
          <p>and Education that Makes You Feel Trapped, of Stupid,</p>
          <p>is Fake Education!</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>It is a trick</p>
          <p>that is robbing you of your right to knowledge and your path to greatness;</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Find A library, find the Philosophy Section,</p>
          <p>and find your beloved books there.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>In the absence of teachers, you become a teacher,</p>
          <p>learn, so that you may help others grow.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Humanity needs you to become a Great Being,</p>
          <p>so that it too, can grow.</p>
