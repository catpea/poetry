          <p>Life is not meant to frighten you,</p>
          <p>it is meant to become your most Beautiful Work Of Art.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Even if we had perfect governments and perfect schools,</p>
          <p>and became perfectly educated...</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>...it would still be better for us all, and the universe,</p>
          <p>if you stopped following and begun leading to become the Best You.</p>

          <p>Yeah, I guess you can&apos;t be a Doctor then,</p>
          <p>but being a Doctor is not as lasting as becoming a Great Being.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>A great being can heal entire generations,</p>
          <p>reminding them of vision, wisdom, and of importance of an examined life.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Very few professionals can go that far out of their way,</p>
          <p>and we all need help with Heart, or Fear, or Answers, and the Art of Existence.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>A career will not help you make sense of life,</p>
          <p>and there will be many challenges as we progress on.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Is it really that foolish to say that Wisdom should come first,</p>
          <p>that we should get a solid grasp on things before setting aims?</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I suppose that wisdom takes a relay long time,</p>
          <p>but that&apos;s not a good reason to make it second to aims we set in High School.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>We all agree that we should all be judged based on the content of our character,</p>
          <p>and Knowledge and Wisdom is a pretty good way to make it Beautiful.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And things like Fear, Loneliness, or Sorrow cannot be helped by a career,</p>
          <p>no matter how well it pays - being Human always comes first.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Only knowledge and the many components of wisdom contained within us</p>
          <p>can help us rise to the great many challenges of life.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Learning to become Knowledgeable and Wise is so wonderful,</p>
          <p>we just take our audio books on long winding nature trails, and sandy beaches.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>We bring our graphite and drawing notepads, even canvas, acrylics and oils,</p>
          <p>and all the questions, that we struggle finding answers to in the midst of haste.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And we learn, on beautiful evenings thick with oxygen, and energizing mornings rich with crisp cool air,</p>
          <p>so as long as we have access to books that help us inherit wisdom from countless other lives, so that we need not start at zero - we learn.</p>
