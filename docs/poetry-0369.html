        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Understanding song structure by listening for it is somewhat difficult,</p>
          <p>too many things are going on at once and one on top of the other.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But song structure, is extremely important,</p>
          <p>as it marks beginnings and ends, helping you reason about buildup and release, and even manage your time during composition.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>One day you may wish to focus on the strong parts of the song where all the action is going on,</p>
          <p>and the next, on the slow parts like intro or closing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>A tidy and simple structure that I prefer,</p>
          <p>has an opening, intro, action1, rest, action2, closing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Action is allowed to repeat,</p>
          <p>and in deed your listener may wish it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Each part can have two halves, first half and second half, the second half allows us to create a tension build-up before we go into to the next part.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>There is an exception to tension build-up,</p>
          <p>the second part of the closing should actually probably slow down or fade.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Let us begin with a clean and simple opening,</p>
          <p>you can see I divided it in two, slow and fast.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>My closing, will use the same melody,</p>
          <p>but I will play the fast part first, followed by slow.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>INTRO PLAYS</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Now, that the song is rolling,</p>
          <p>we begin preparing for action with a two part intro.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The second part of the intro introduces drums,</p>
          <p>and some extra complexity for easy transition into action.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>INTRO PLAYS</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The action is also divided in two halves,</p>
          <p>this increases complexity and gives the ear a bit more to listen to.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is important to note that duration of actions and upcoming rest,</p>
          <p>is the same as both opening and warm-up added together.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Here I rely on strings to provide all the action:</p>
          <p>ACTION1 PLAYS</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And here is the center piece of the song,</p>
          <p>often times it is the part where your listener rests from the action a little bit.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I chose to remove drums from here and empathize the flute,</p>
          <p>to give the listener something delicate to focus on.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The rest has a strong build up,</p>
          <p>as not to too abruptly leap into the second action part.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>REST PLAYS.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The second action has little-more to offer than the first,</p>
          <p>it may not be a good idea to switch too many things around especially if it is a dance song.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>So it is basically a copy of the first action,</p>
          <p>and in this case it is followed by the piano melody from the opening, but now arranged in such a way as to give the listener closure.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Here is the song we made, in full,</p>
          <p>I hope you like it.</p>
        </div>
