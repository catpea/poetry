          <p>The time meant for your growing up,</p>

          <p>Growing up,</p>
          <p>is not as random as it seems.</p>

          <p>Your own observations,</p>
          <p>will create questions.</p>

          <p>Growing up, begins with simple questions, and simple answers,</p>
          <p>but we amass a library of twisty little passages.</p>

          <p>We face the Universe,</p>
          <p>and there are consequences to all our actions.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>What do we do when the bullies come?</p>
          <p>We learn to practice restraint, so that we don&apos;t end up the snarling beasts they are.</p>

        <section>
          <p>What do we do, when people belittle us, step on us?</p>
          <p>We expand our own sense of Dignity, and Nobility into an Independent Universe free of their flaws and limitations.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And how do we stand up against Isolation, or being Cast Away?</p>

          <p>Your growing up,</p>
          <p>is the very Formation of you.</p>

        <section>
          <p>I don&apos;t know if there is anything more sacred,</p>

        <section>
          <p>You must learn to push what is not important away,</p>
          <p>you must get comfortable with not following.</p>

        <section>
          <p>And you must stand your ground, or walk your path...</p>
          <p>You must, lead.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>You must make sure that you rise a little higher each and every day,</p>
          <p>and that each day adds to the previous.</p>
