          <p>Forgive me, Dear Reader, as this poem does not yet end with an answer,</p>
          <p>but it does create a question that brings us one step closer to it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>President Kennedy once said,</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>&quot;Too many of us think it is impossible too many think it is unreal but that is a dangerous defeatist belief</p>
          <p>it leads to the conclusion that war is inevitable that mankind is doomed that we are gripped by forces we cannot control</p>
          <p>we need not accept that view our problems are man-made therefore they can be solved by man and man can be as big as he wants</p>
          <p>no problem of human destiny is beyond human beings</p>
          <p>man&apos;s reason and spirit have often solved the seemingly unsolvable and we believe they can do it again&quot;.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The world misunderstood money,</p>
          <p>and it has begun relying on its simplest and most primitive mechanics.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Who knows why, but we can see that those who are in the know,</p>
          <p>for example business people on Wall Street, use it differently from the rest of us.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Well, the rest of us can build complex streets as well,</p>
          <p>we can erect infrastructure that will help US use it differently.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We are Eight Billion strong,</p>
          <p>the wrong doers are nothing by contrast.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Poverty can only be erased by those who are its victims,</p>
          <p>world governments are too primitive to do anything about it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The human mind is powerful and beautiful,</p>
          <p>and all human beings deserve safety, food, and a home, not just shelter, but a home.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In order to build an infrastructure that can bring money to the poor,</p>
          <p>we will have to use technology - computer tablets can be as inexpensive as $35.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>A tablet connected to the global internet,</p>
          <p>is far more powerful than shorting stocks and predicting or manipulating markets.</p>
        </div>

          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We have to start with a person who was given a plastic chair,</p>
          <p>at a local homeless shelter.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>They have the option of work assistance,</p>
          <p>or having their chair taken away.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And we have to start with prisons, a long sentence,</p>
          <p>nothing to coma back to but more broken promises, and more poverty.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Prison takes away the Hope in Humanity,</p>
          <p>the way the so called smart people treat the criminals destroys our entire world.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And here, we give a person,</p>
          <p>access to a tablet.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Obviously the first and foremost,</p>
          <p>are the narrated books.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>No matter how dark the future,</p>
          <p>the narrated books, bring the light.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>They help sleep at night,</p>
          <p>they bring knowledge and experience.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And they are beautiful, private,</p>
          <p>sacred and full of wisdom.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Here great many voice actors and celebrities,</p>
          <p>will MAKE time to lend their voice to books in the Public Domain.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>While the books will heal the mind, and bring wisdom, and calm,</p>
          <p>as well as the understanding that being born poor to a violent neighborhood victimizes a person into someone other than they really are; in other words self-forgiveness.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Here the least fortunate of The Human Family,</p>
          <p>still need a way out of poverty.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>There needs to be a program on the tablet,</p>
          <p>that will both protect the assets they create, and help them create more.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>For many that tablet will represent the work of a lifetime,</p>
          <p>the full measure, of the hope, in their new and better future.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Whatever happens on that tablet,</p>
          <p>must be safe from fellow inmates, prison employees, and crooked politicians and presidents.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We can all be sure,</p>
          <p>that things that do represent monetary value, require study; and the more one learns the easier it gets.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The simplest and safest asset a person under attack can keep,</p>
          <p>is knowledge learned.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>For example, if the tablet was to teach how to write computer programs,</p>
          <p>how to design user interfaces, efficient web servers, secure networks.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>That person would be able to leave their past behind,</p>
          <p>and build a company, perhaps with colleagues from the same environment.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This is not the same as going to school, or even going to business school,</p>
          <p>this the study and assembly of a ready to go development house.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The tablet would contain a simulated, ready to go business,</p>
          <p>with real case studies, and projects.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In a safer environment, where it is possible to open a bank account,</p>
          <p>where one can be reasonably sure that what lite money they have will not be taken away.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>A planet wide market,</p>
          <p>where people create digital goods.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>A program architecture that relies on the human mind,</p>
          <p>where a person is answering simple questions to build a unique and greater whole that will help them out of poverty.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And while this would be too cumbersome for one individual,</p>
          <p>it would be doable for a network of thousands, or perhaps billions of people fighting their way out of poverty.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Where prison offers time to practice,</p>
          <p>the world of the streets requires an instant trickle of money.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And this income must absolutely require,</p>
          <p>the best and most creative that the human mind can produce.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This way world&apos;s Corrupt Politicians will not be able to force the homeless to slave for them,</p>
          <p>it has to be more meaningful work than training neural networks.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We can convert prisons to Start-up Accelerators,</p>
          <p>that will emerge companies ready to accept clients.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But helping people who don&apos;t have a roof over their head,</p>
          <p>who don&apos;t have rations waiting for them, must include instant money.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is not just a man on a plastic chair,</p>
          <p>it is also the woman who has nowhere left to go.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>What is on the tablet that helps her pay for the apartment,</p>
          <p>and it isn&apos;t just random noise, but something meaningful, that adds up to create a greater whole.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Because if we can help those two,</p>
          <p>go to pay rent, and buy a house, and a car and then make it a home.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Then we will have ended poverty,</p>
          <p>not just for those two, but for the world over.</p>
