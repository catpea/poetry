          <p>The Philosophers attempt to bring ideas to the future generations,</p>
          <p>they are masters of learning how to think, conceptualize, and get extremely smart.</p>

        <section>
          <p>There are a few things that we must set aside at first,</p>
          <p>and above all remember that they were children once, teenagers, that they are all too human.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>When possible we should begin with survey courses and general overviews,</p>
          <p>Video Lectures and Audio Books on the subject of Philosophy in general.</p>

          <p>In 1977 they were presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Gerald Ford,</p>

          <p>We must not judge a Philosophy by the mistakes of the Philosopher,</p>
          <p>if they did make mistakes, then they published hoping to be granted a hearing.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>We should avoid memorizing, ideally we want to approach Philosophers that we find familiar,</p>
          <p>and perhaps already having re-invented some portion of what they worked on.</p>

          <p>One concept that comes to mind is Amor Fati,</p>
          <p>it means Love of Fate.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>But to me, it does not speak about the kind of fate where everything is pre-determined,</p>
          <p>or the fate of a person who lets whim and life push them around, but rather events that just happen.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a> wrote a great deal about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amor_fati">Amor Fati</a>,</p>
          <p>but in my opinion he takes it too far as he speaks of Suffering, he runs into the extremes.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>My bullies are an example of Extremes and Suffering,</p>
          <p>and Amor Fati does not mean I should love my bullies, and Friedrich states as much:</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>&quot;Only great pain is the ultimate liberator of the spirit. I doubt that such pain makes us &#x2018;better&#x2019;; but I know that it makes us more profound.&quot;</p>
          <p>(Thanks Friedrich, My Dear Old Friend.)</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Albert Camus brings it down to reality,</p>
          <p>speaking of accepting that life comes with Difficulty and Ease, and we should accept both.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>&quot;A will to live without rejecting anything of life... is the virtue I honor most in this world.&quot;</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>It is not enough to learn <strong>about</strong> a philosophical concept like we just did,</p>
          <p>we should hope to integrate it, or keep it as a reminder that we have more to learn before we understand it fully.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>The way I connect with Amor Fati,</p>
          <p>is by understanding that not everything in my life will happen for a reason,</p>
          <p>some thing will just happen out of complexity and randomness that we can&apos;t prevent; and that to me is fate.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I like how Albert Camus telks about Ease and Difficulty and the way I understand him,</p>
          <p>is that we should stand up for what we believe in, even if it means that people will yell at us.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>So it is not tolerance of difficult things that just happen for no reason,</p>
          <p>but the difficulty of standing up for what we believe in when the chance presents it self, for no reason- you see.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Our decision making which dictates our path in life,</p>
          <p>has nothing to do with things that happen for no reason.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Finally, Amor Fati simply means,</p>
          <p>do not let things that you have no control over take away from your Love of Life.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>While this may not be exactly what Friedrich Nietzsche and Albert Camus talk about,</p>
          <p>my initial, more personal interpretation, gives me a platform from which I can learn both of their interpretations and mutual differences.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And what I am showing here, is that we don&apos;t have to understand all the philosophical concepts right away,</p>
          <p>that it is best to learn a little bit at a time, at our own pace, and in our own sequence.</p>
