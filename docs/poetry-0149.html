          <p>Life is always about learning and knowing,</p>
          <p>all those winds of change freely blowing.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>But there is something you must always remember,</p>
          <p>that you are a <strong>Raging Fire</strong> not a glowing ember.</p>

          <p>It is your <strong>right</strong> to <strong>strive</strong> and <strong>thrive</strong> and <strong>grow</strong>,</p>
          <p>may you <strong>melt</strong> all the sleeping-and-cold snow.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Let there fill new oceans, let the rivers flow,</p>
          <p>and may the sun shine forever with your beautiful glow.</p>

          <p>We each should live our lives with a huge thunder,</p>
          <p>because no matter the tests life is always a wonder.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>But the best things come from us beating life&apos;s test,</p>
          <p>by rising up, becoming wise, and doing our best.</p>

          <p>No challenge is ever as easy as it looks,</p>
          <p>it all requires reading plenty of books.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I don&apos;t think anybody is ever truly blessed,</p>
          <p>I think life may push us all to feel stressed.</p>

        <section>
          <p>But we are each so special and so strong, and so sweet,</p>
          <p>that we can all take on the challenge, and handle the heat.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>All the things we hold tight to the breast,</p>
          <p>always come from some hard challenge or quest.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <hr>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>It is <strong>all</strong> about learning and taking that harder route,</p>
          <p>so that each day we grow-more in wisdom and less in doubt.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>So please, always strive to do your best,</p>
          <p>so that the 90 year old you can get some good night&apos;s rest.</p>
