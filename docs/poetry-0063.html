          <p>While the sunsets are over the sea,</p>
          <p>the sunrise, must rise from behind dunes.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>There are no dunes taller than these,</p>
          <p>they are ancient, born of frozen seas.</p>

          <p>When the sun finally made it,</p>
          <p>the warm air rolled down the dune.</p>

          <p>The symphony of the ancient forest,</p>
