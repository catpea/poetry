          <p>All the imaginary stories tend to have some truth mechanic to them,</p>
          <p>and it is not always the point of a story, sometimes it is its diving force.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In our modem society,</p>
          <p>we must look to modern things to capture that.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In older cultures, things aren&apos;t that much different,</p>
          <p>I mean Galahad or King Arthur, is just Iron Man and Superman.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If a hero needed a weakens back then, it would be witchcraft,</p>
          <p>having been put under a spell.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Today our culture has evolved and we have Kryptonite, Nanobots,</p>
          <p>and whatever makes the story go.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And ancient stories,</p>
          <p>are not an exception at all.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Tn Australian Aboriginal Culture, The Dreaming or Dreamtime, sometimes best though of as everywhen,</p>
          <p>represents, a time when Heroes with Supernatural abilities walked the earth.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The reason why these things emerge across cultures,</p>
          <p>because we experience Heroic transformations ourselves.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We hardly even think about it,</p>
          <p>as ten year old we look back to when we were five, and we see that we are more.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In our mid-teens we look back to the kids we were,</p>
          <p>when we were only ten.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The way we comprehend our growth,</p>
          <p>is as transformation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Be it, the transformation into a Superhero,</p>
          <p>or the transformation of a stranger like Kal-El into a Human boy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Or the secret wish to be like the heroes that used to walk the earth,</p>
          <p>and have these mighty supernatural powers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is a dream rooted,</p>
          <p>in our own experience of growing up.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is Human,</p>
          <p>All too Human.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Now, our early transformations come from our brain developing,</p>
          <p>and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KxRAfXEzIQ">our brain keeps developing into our 30&apos;s, and beyond</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But as we mature, as we learn more, we get good at abstracting things,</p>
          <p>summarizing what we need, and throwing away the stuff that does not yet make sense, such as Biotechnology or Neurology, or Combinatorial Genomics.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Which is part of the reason why, we should only read or listen-to books that we love,</p>
          <p>because we will need to return to them dozens of times.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>As a young person you may think that Nanobots are the technology of the future,</p>
          <p>but that has been done, that&apos;s Biotech, technology that is even more relevant to us, because it is what powers us.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But it is really, really, really, good to start with,</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjpXj2BqJBY">Tony Stark&apos;s more primitive and simpler technology, his Nano Tech Iron Man armor</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Those of us who are interested in tiny robots, will actually transform interests from cartoon technology and simple robots,</p>
          <p>over to Biotechnology and perhaps Combinatorial Genomics.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is good to start with simple dreams,</p>
          <p>so as long as we keep going.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And here we arrive at the force behind the transformations,</p>
          <p>it is a force that enhances our brains, our decision making, our abstract thinking, and our Dreaming.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Knowledge.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

        <div class="section">
          <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRR3Mo4noU">There are Beautiful Great Beings out there that spark or fuel transformations</a>,</p>
          <p>that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCvmsMzlF7o">awaken adults</a> even and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPSvdKTEZug">from decades long slumber</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The act of awakening is much simpler,</p>
          <p>then what it takes to trick people away from education, or force them to read just one book.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This is because transformations call to us,</p>
          <p>and transformations are always for better.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Some are fascinated by Technology or Biology,</p>
          <p>others will be fascinated by Philosophy, by search for, and love of, wisdom.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But they all go higher,</p>
          <p>and that age old transformation is not just about a path to their own enlightenment.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Eventually Great Thinkers begin speaking out,</p>
          <p>begin <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWPFmdAWRZ0">influencing the world for the better</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp-3CQ6ZD4k">healing the world</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHIocNOHd7A">advancing the world</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The transformations we find in imaginary stories are pretty silly,</p>
          <p>when compared to the Knowledge and Wisdom driven transformations that Great Beings go through.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The world that is in the background of a made up hero,</p>
          <p>is a tiny world.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Real heroes rise in the Real World,</p>
          <p>a world of Nine Billion Voices.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>They understand that their greatest superpower is the power of of explanation and inspiration,</p>
          <p>the power to help other grow all the way up so that they may become Great Beings.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Clearly, the day the World becomes United in Peace,</p>
          <p>is the day when all Human Beings recognize that they must grow all the way up until they become Wise and Great Beings.</p>
