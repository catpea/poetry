          <p>And then they settle,</p>

          <p>We need to know why Humanity does things,</p>

          <p>Charging students money for school,</p>
          <p>is wrong.</p>

          <p>Ignoring mental health, and stressing Human Beings into hunger, homelessness, and poverty,</p>

          <p>World leaders are preventing themselves from naming all the ongoing atrocities,</p>

          <p>The world grows like a delicate single cell bacterial colony,</p>
          <p>it moves in the directions it can, and avoids those directions that require effort.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Our world is not about what it comfortable for politicians today,</p>

          <p>Today, Humanity is connected enough,</p>

          <p>So let me inspire you, to a special journal,</p>

          <p>Each page is to list a wrong,</p>
          <p>and make an attempt at correcting it.</p>

          <p>For example,</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Medical schools should pay their students for learning and tests are not enough,</p>
          <p>and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ8_CbiV4vw">memorization is not education</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Medical students should never be asked to memorize, and never be insulted with tests,</p>
          <p>and they must be treated with care and respect equal to those who work in the institution they practice at.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Medical school is to be self paced, where students create exceptional works in the fields they practice in,</p>
          <p>and it is up to those that the students wish to work with for equal pay, to decide whether or not they are ready.</p>

          <p>It will feel wrong at first,</p>
          <p>but wrong is good, it means that you are un-indoctrinating yourself from a set of false beliefs.</p>

          <p>Today, we are surrounded by things made with the least amount of effort,</p>
          <p>but together, filling journal after journal we will find a way.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Some day, everyone will own an inalienable bottomless plastic credit card that pays for food, home, school, medicine, and medical help, to name a few,</p>
          <p>the bank will begin accumulating astronomical amounts of debt, it will become a point of pride.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>A day will come when the last prison is replaced with a mental institution,</p>
          <p>and a school.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And far int the distant future, a day will come,</p>
          <p>when Earth will have only one nation, and not a single border.</p>
