          <p>The best way to win against a liar, is to never meet one,</p>
          <p>the simplest way to &quot;win&quot; is not to play their game.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>This is extremely easy, because avoidance of liars entails a path that they will never walk on,</p>
          <p>liars will never walk on the path of Knowledge, Invention, Hard Earned Accomplishment, Wisdom, and Greatness.</p>

          <p>One example of a good liar is that good old Wild Wild West snake oil salesman,</p>
          <p>they were probably selling cheap sugar and cheap moonshine, because it was cheap to make and didn&apos;t cause much headache.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>But it, looking like an expensive medicine, and costing like one,</p>
          <p>when people felt it in their system, they automatically assumed it was working.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>This is still going on, and when I was a teenager I actually bought a skin cleanser,</p>
          <p>at a pharmacy, in the US, that in no uncertain terms, stated that this was homeopathic medicine,</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Home and medicine, sounded good to me,</p>
          <p>and it seemed to have been a gentle soap, but it was just the cheapest thing that they could possibly put in a tube.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I checked the top three pharmacies in the US in 2020, and heart-breakingly,</p>
          <p>they all continue selling homeopathic &quot;medicine&quot;.</p>
        </section>

        <section>

        <section>
          <p>Knowledge and Wisdom, and the path it entails,</p>
          <p>is the most wonderful and safest way to avoid all this nonsense.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Because once you become more knowledgeable than the liar,</p>
          <p>you will be able to hear them bending words, and twisting stories, the way your Mum was able to pick up on subtle cues when you were lying as a baby.</p>

          <p>Now, past some point in an education, many, or perhaps most people, front healthy skepticism first,</p>
          <p>not because they assume everyone is a liar, but because they wonder if someone might not have tricked themselves into a falsehood like I did with my homeopathic &quot;medicine&quot;.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>More than that, when I was a teenager, and someone asked me if <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mokele-mbembe">Mokele-mbembe</a><a> existed,</a></p><a>
            <p>I would whole heatedly, and with all the love in my heart, say:</p>

          <section>
            <p>&quot;I hope so, after all, it is not a question of their existence, is it now? They used to exist millions of years ago.</p>
            <p>It is a question of whether or not there is one or two, left in Rhodesia.&quot; - with a heavy and hairy accent, whilst bouncing my unibrow up an down.</p>

          <section>
            <p>Anybody asking me about cryptozoology was better off,</p>
            <p>fronting mountains of skepticism first - the brontosaurus was my favorite dinosaur!</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>And get this, Brontosaurus is no longer the same thunder lizard we are all familiar with,</p>
            <p>it was a misclassification, the dinosaur that you think of as Brontosaurus is actually called Apatosaurus now.</p>

            <p>In context of liars, which are pretty damn scary, and only get more frightening as they come together in groups,</p>
            <p>...searching for forgiveness, reinforcement and easy pickings to whatever their disorder is; we need to take to knowledge and wisdom as soon as possible.</p>

            <p>Middle school, is a pretty good time to start learning for real,</p>
            <p>and start climbing over everyone&apos;s heads, to get ahead of things.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>Books narrated by their authors,</p>
            <p>are an especially precious gift of knowledge.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>Bill Bryson has some nice and funny books that help people grow,</p>
            <p>A Walk in the Woods, A Short History of Nearly Everything, The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid, and In a Sunburned Country, are beautiful.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>But it is best that you start with what moves you,</p>
            <p>look at various best seller lists, and keep an eye on non-fiction of you can.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>And climb, keep searching for that next book that will agree with you,</p>
            <p>and explore everything, explore the world, the trails, the libraries, all the places of knowledge, wisdom and greatness.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>It does not take many books to get ahead of liars,</p>
            <p>it only takes a few more to get ahead of those that don&apos;t know they are causing harm.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>And here the handful of your beloved Memoirs, Biographies, and adventure books,</p>
            <p>will transform ,to your Sword and Shield, and you will fell many a monster and dragon, onward to a cheerful future.</p>

          <section>
            <p>Start learning on your own, not just to avoid liars and crappy people,</p>
            <p>but to become you, the person that you are predisposed to be.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>As you grow, there will be some mild regrets, but it is not going to be anything huge,</p>
            <p>and whatever you do end up missing by taking your own less traveled road...</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>Use is as a compass, just because you missed something, it doesn&apos;t mean you can&apos;t find it again,</p>
            <p>feeling like you missed something is a beautiful call to new adventure.</p>
          </section>

          <section>

            <p>those are the very components by which humanity grows.</p>
