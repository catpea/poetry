          <p>There are tipping points in your intellectual development,</p>
          <p>where you go from careful observation to certainty of knowing.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>You build one thing on top of the other,</p>
          <p>it becomes your Temple of Knowledge.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>If you are correct about it all,</p>
          <p>then the more you add the more you understand.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>To learn for real,</p>
          <p>we need fascination.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And we need freedom to move between curiosities,</p>
          <p>and there are no divisions of subjects here.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>We may learn numbers from calculating how many potential exoplanets our radio signals reached,</p>
          <p>or we may trade mathematical notation for computer programming-languages where we can bring numbers to life.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Then quickly leap to Astrophotography, and learn about Biology from books written by Astrobiologists,</p>
          <p>Enlightenment is not just about what we target precisely, but also what we learn along the way.</p>

        <section>
          <p>Enlightenment is Life, it is going round and round, and higher and higher,</p>
          <p>through all these tiny twisty passages of Curiosity and Fascination to Discover more and more Light.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>There is no need to divide Enlightenment from Wisdom and Knowledge,</p>
          <p>but we must make a strong division between Real Education that brings results,</p>
          <p>and Fake Education that makes you unhappy, exhausted, stressed.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Because unhappiness, exhaustion and stress,</p>
          <p>will <strong>stop you</strong> from growing up, from becoming wise and enlightened,</p>
          <p>from becoming an inspiration and helping the world grow a little.</p>

        <section>
          <p>It is a scary thing to aim away from everything we&apos;ve been taught to want,</p>
          <p>but you are you and not what someone tells you to be</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>...and you are supposed to be much more courageous than merely taking your own path in life,</p>
          <p>we can&apos;t live like quiet little mice just to be nice.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>We have too much imagination, too much passion and inspiration, foresight insight and vision,</p>
          <p>we are not to live ordinary lives.</p>

        <section>
          <p>We are Thinking Humans!</p>
          <p>We are to live Lives of Inspired Enlightenment.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Because that&apos;s what furthers Human Kind the most,</p>
          <p>because that is part of what is <strong>best</strong> within us.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Human Kind must grow in Wisdom and Enlightenment,</p>
          <p>each of us is more than capable of becoming a Great Being.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>When we grow the Wold Grows With Us,</p>
          <p>let us make this world a better place for us all.</p>
