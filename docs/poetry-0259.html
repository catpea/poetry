          <p>Even if you set off at noon,</p>
          <p>you will discover, the new moon.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>While the day is full of light,</p>
          <p>it is not over, till midnight.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>Because, once your eyes get used to the night,</p>
          <p>the moon and the stars, become almost as bright.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>Though many, may count their sheep,</p>
          <p>an adventurer need not yet go, to sleep.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>Please, believe me, there are sights to see!</p>
          <p>there is a second world out here, and night is key.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>Aside from the occasional streak of silent owl,</p>
          <p>you may catch a pack of coyotes, look up, and howl.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>Some grasses by the beach glow blue,</p>
          <p>static electricity can create a breathtaking view.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>Over in the ocean all the glowing fish come out,</p>
          <p>they look like stars, when scattered about.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>And the moon does not glow, it carries a reflection of the sun,</p>
          <p>the photons touched it, and now touch us, in their cosmic fun.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>The trees take on a whole new life in the moonlight,</p>
          <p>rich green fragrant watchers of your campsite.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>The night in many ways is just as bright as the day,</p>
          <p>if you have never been on an adventure... please don&apos;t delay.</p>
