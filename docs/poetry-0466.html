          <p>Somehow,</p>

          <p>A set of lectures by a magnificent teacher,</p>

          <p>That is why I say that our Life and Mind,</p>
          <p>should be a Masterpiece, that it is a work of art.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The best lessons, that teach us the most,</p>
          <p>must be crafted by an artist.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>A powerful, knowledgeable, wise, and inspirational teacher,</p>
          <p>someone that knows the weaknesses, and loves to help.</p>

          <p>There is one itsy-bitsy little bit, that is highly computerized,</p>
          <p>and that is the path that students take through the lectures.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>See not everyone is interested in all the things the lecture holds,</p>
          <p>so a set of lectures has to be flexible, and that means computerized.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And this is great, because it means the teacher gives the lecture once,</p>
          <p>and then it becomes infinitely re-playable, by an infinite number of students.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But please note that this is the simplest lecture model,</p>
          <p>it is best used for teachers that are deeply connected to their lecture.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Single-teacher lectures,</p>
          <p>are primary for the purpose of honoring the teachers and their art of teaching.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The standard lecture format,</p>
          <p>is very similar to a wikipedia category.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>There are many students,</p>
          <p>continuously improving the various lectures in the set.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And let me just say that they are all volunteers,</p>
          <p>money-making or hoarding has no place in education.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>School and Knowledge is meant to be free,</p>
          <p>otherwise it is just fraud, perpetrated on the future generations.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is more than volunteers,</p>
          <p>and quality of the lectures.</p>

          <p>It is also the usefulness,</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Today, when a student does not understand mathematics,</p>
          <p>they are encouraged and forced to pretend to understand it by memorization, by acting.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The force is pretty formidable,</p>
          <p>they will be punished with grades, that will destroy their GPA, and in some cases sent to prison, the prison of repeating a year.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The future generations will never forgive us for this,</p>
          <p>I don&apos;t event want to tell you what they will think of us.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In a real school, when actually learning for real,</p>
          <p>getting snagged on something is no different then discovering something uniquely interesting about a subject.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Not understanding something very well,</p>
          <p>and wanting to understand something very much, is the same thing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In today&apos;s schools, one leads to being told to pay attention, or else,</p>
          <p>and the other to the barbaric act of actually being punished.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I think the first subject that people have difficulty with,</p>
          <p>is mathematics.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Mathematics, is actually taught wrong,</p>
          <p>the lectures are so broken, that they likely transformed into a memorization dog an pony show.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And memorization is not education,</p>
          <p>it is just make-believe, it is just acting.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>There are teachers out there that can help students understand,</p>
          <p>but it is actually really bad for the classroom.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Because lovingly teaching all students to understand all the concepts,</p>
          <p>will require far more time then what a class has before the final.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>There will not be enough time to cover all the concepts,</p>
          <p>the class curriculum is not meant for real education, but mere memorization.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The bureaucracy of the school,</p>
          <p>does not care that you are educated, they only care that you pass the tests.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>What is there to be done in this situation?</p>
          <p>that part is really easy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I call it &quot;The Million Student March&quot;,</p>
          <p>but don&apos;t worry, you don&apos;t have to get up from your chair.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>What you have to do is stop pretending,</p>
          <p>your willingness to cram, to memorize, is helping this strange theater carry on.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You have to stop pretending that memorization is an education,</p>
          <p>and start learning for real, on your own.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And this part is really, really, important,</p>
          <p>there are some subjects that are so important, that without their knowledge you will be immanently tricked.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You need to know about physics, don&apos;t worry about the formulas - as that comes next, and it can&apos;t be easier,</p>

          <p>that as everything else has been horribly misrepresented.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And this particular goodie,</p>
          <p>grants you the ability to get inside any system of any complexity.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This subject is so powerful that you can do experiments on spacetime it self,</p>
          <p>by actually simulating sustained acceleration for prolonged periods such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Orion_(nuclear_propulsion)">Project Orion</a> describes,</p>
          <p>and run tests on things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_singularity">gravitational singularities</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I am of course describing,</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGeT8IyKd2M">Programming</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Programming is how you learn mathematics for real,</p>
          <p>for one, the notation is consistent, <a href="https://github.com/Jam3/math-as-code">as Math As Code states: &quot;Mathematical symbols can mean different things depending on the author, context and the field of study&quot;</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Don&apos;t worry, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmJ-4B-mS-Y">school wasn&apos;t teaching you real math anyway</a>,</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmoor8DwqW4">you were just learning an easy to pretend-to-learn fragment mostly for the bureaucrats, and so that the teachers would keep getting paid</a>,</p>
          <p>the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbKtFN71Lfs">real math is actually pretty cool</a> and full of interesting mysteries.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But you can&apos;t approach, neural networks or combinatronics for example, directly,</p>
          <p>the way school presents these subjects is basically toxic, insane, deadly, and crazy - it is deeply heartless.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The right way to approach neural networks,</p>
          <p>is by looking at <a href="https://brain.js.org/#/examples">Simple Letter Detection or maybe Color Contrast examples over at brain.js</a>,</p>
          <p>and follow up with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=neural+networks+explained">couple of videos</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I think even more illustrative of the need for programming is combinatronics,</p>
          <p>and the way you would get at it, is by cracking passwords in a cute little hacker game that you would program as part of learning programming.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The complicated subjects in mathematics,</p>
          <p>are so trivial in the programming word, that no programmer dares to say a thing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Start learning programming by taking to JavaScript,</p>
          <p>and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j0UDiN7my4">Learning how to mess around with P5.js</a>.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Other people working on the same subject,</p>
