          <p>Learning has a lot to do with being able to make direct connections</p>
          <p>between what we know, and where we are hoping to get.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If you skip a connection,</p>
          <p>learning will become frustrating because you will not be grounded in anything.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>There are too components at play</p>
          <p>when we are forced to abandon knowledge for memorization.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>On one end it is the threat of failing a class,</p>
          <p>this is similar to how criminals are forced to plead guilty, rather than stand up for truth.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And on the other it is being forced into learning something,</p>
          <p>that we don&apos;t have any base knowledge for, and thus cannot help but t memorize it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If you don&apos;t have the dots,</p>
          <p>you are forced into abandoning learning in favor of just acting like you know, or memorizing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The teacher, gets paid, you get your diploma, the school gets funding,</p>
          <p>for as long as you are pretending to learn, everything appears to work.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The threat of failing a class must not force you into memorization,</p>
          <p>because that only cheats _you_, and helps the teachers get paid.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You are supposed to rise above inauthenticity,</p>
          <p>the way you win in this situation, is by not playing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Eventually, once you educate yourself for real,</p>
          <p>you can comeback to school for your diploma and carry on with whatever your career may be.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>A career will require a trail of diplomas,</p>
          <p>the only other alternative here is becoming a founder, and creating a series of small companies.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Returning to school with the knowledge of a thousand books and years of experience,</p>
          <p>feels wonderful, it feels like revisiting your home town.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The curricula will still fore you into memorization,</p>
          <p>but your self education will greatly help you with that.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Obviously, once you know the subjects for real,</p>
          <p>the tests are trivial, if not a downright insult.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>At no point should you ever throw your years away,</p>
          <p>if that is what High School or College Feels like, come back later.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Real education is too important,</p>
          <p>it has great impact on your decisions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>While pretending to get an education works on the surface,</p>
          <p>not having read a few hundred biographies may make your elder self regret your decisions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>SO there is no question here, if your school is fake,</p>
          <p>come back later, after you have learned on your own.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Even the fact that all the tests you take from high school to college,</p>
          <p>are connected together and rely on one another is not a good reason to participate in inauthentic education.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Your years are precious,</p>
          <p>not a single one is allowed to be thrown away.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If you do return to school later on, keep in mind that professionals can&apos;t rely on people with inauthentic education,</p>
          <p>self taught people with real knowledge, that accepted their responsibility for their own education will be in high demand.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But do not forget that the institution that you are re-entering,</p>
          <p>is fundamentally inauthentic and relies on temporary memorization to stay in operation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This inauthenticity will begin manifesting it self in many ways,</p>
          <p>and your stay there may become frustrating.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Also keep in mind, that your career may expect the kind of a person that feels OK with temporary memorization,</p>
          <p>that being self educated, and equipped with diplomas is not a guaranteed that your career will be healthy for you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If you are searching for guarantees in life,</p>
          <p>then make self education and becoming a business founder one and the same.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>When I question the way education works,</p>
          <p>I always think of Doctors, and how impossible it is for a self taught person to get there.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But even so, that is not an excuse not to be educated for real,</p>
          <p>that is no excuse to forgo books that teach us about life.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You still need the real deal,</p>
          <p>real knowledge, real wisdom, strong decisions that will make your elder self live life with great satisfaction, knowing that you have chosen wisely.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If your career choice interferes with you moving towards becoming a Wise and Great Being,</p>
          <p>then the path you have chosen for yourself is blocked, or damaged, and you may need to rethink your career choice.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Real knowledge, real wisdom,</p>
          <p>must always come first.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Whatever you want from your future,</p>
          <p>you must first take care of yourself.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Be compassionate with yourself,</p>
          <p>love yourself.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If you don&apos;t take great care of yourself,</p>
          <p>then people will be too scared to care about you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Because when you hurt,</p>
          <p>those who care about you hurt too.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>There is a lot of incomplete things in our word,</p>
          <p>there is a lot of broken promises, like standardized education, and healthy careers with proper retirement.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The only way to build new things and repair what is broken so that it may stand complete for the future generations,</p>
          <p>is to be authentic about what works today, and what does not.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Whatever the things today,</p>
          <p>that are not yet strong enough, for you to climb on, so that you may reach your dreams, those are the things that need your help.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>That is likely to be your Call To Greatness,</p>
          <p>and the aim to your self education, and all the great many adventures, to follow.</p>
