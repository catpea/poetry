          <p>First of all, I want you to know, that you could win that Prize.</p>
          <p>bestowed upon those who made the greatest contributions to humankind.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And that there are multiple pathways,</p>
          <p>so as long as you are in the right place, somewhere out on the edge.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is hard to say a bad thing about it,</p>
          <p>but the road there is not perfect.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ti9ZsP4wa0Q">The schools are not working</a> for one,</p>
          <p>and as always there will be troublemakers and liars along the way.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You will be forced to learn strange and ultimately meaningless things to get into a brand name college,</p>
          <p>tested by an outdated ever-being-phased-out process, and you need the full 1600 score, to send a message.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You need to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2A0aOqVn3E">start preparing for the SAT years ahead of graduating high school</a>,</p>
          <p>at first your entire education must be structured to unhinge the SAT patterns.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Apply to all the expensive colleges,,</p>
          <p>and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aNp6bJCAhU">learn to relax but keep moving, fast.</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You are not going to give the Senior Orator speech,</p>
          <p>because to get at the Prize you will not have the time to follow all instructions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Then you will need to find a lab that is doing cutting edge research,</p>
          <p>and begin scanning the unknown for anomalies, don&apos;t focus on what seems interesting, so much as what is anomalous and unexplored.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You will become a World Class Scientist, you will become a force of science, you will be huge, a perfect expert in your field,</p>
          <p>and with a touch of luck easily find something, maybe in anti-aging, or DNA recombination, computer integration.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>That will nearly guarantee you the Prize,</p>
          <p>it will be a great accomplishment.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Worse comes to worst, it may just be that the Prize Committee is not going to be as forward in their thinking as they should be,</p>
          <p>but that will be just as good as the prize, you will know it, the history books will know it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>There is a lot of forks in the road, yes,</p>
          <p>and the correct paths rely on luck, yes, but you can make your own luck by standing at the fork long enough.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Once you get into the university, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jONxkm62aDI">the outsider-teacher will say the truth: they don&apos;t know if the grades and classes and guidance, will help you at all</a>,</p>
          <p>they are teaching blind, and throwing these blind tests at your feet, which is more like interference than help, isn&apos;t it?</p>
        </div>


        <div class="section">
          <p>There will be bumps in the road,</p>
          <p>unfairness along the way.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>What happened to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIP0lYrdirI">Rosalind Franklin</a>,</p>
          <p>is beyond heartbreaking.</p>
        </div>

          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I think, I want you to have more than a prize,</p>
          <p>I don&apos;t want anybody to fight things that should honor them, be it school or whichever company you care to work at.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If the schools were working,</p>
          <p>if you didn&apos;t need to fight odds.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If you could start in High School,</p>
          <p>not a lab at 40, then this could be balanced with life.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We are not machines, we aren&apos;t meant to bend odds that are against us out of stupidity, greed, inauthenticity, shortsightedness, or whether or not our parents work in that lab,</p>
          <p>we shouldn&apos;t need to sacrifice on our way towards that kind of greatness.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Rosalind Franklin... Elsie was fighting the same fight that stands in your way,</p>
          <p>and liars are cunning, and evil, and they drain us of energy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>What the hell does a Dean at a Brand Name University know about what it takes to be like Elsie,</p>
          <p>the things claiming to help you will be attacking you if not downright stalking you out of debt, greed, jealousy, the same damn nonsense that has always held humanity back.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Remember Sun Tzu?</p>
          <p>&quot;Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win.&quot;</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It may be that the world isn&apos;t good enough to appreciate the many sacrifices that you will surely make along the way,</p>
          <p>I want you to choose living a healthy and balanced life, where DNA recombination is something you do as a second thought with the person that you will end up sharing the rest of your very long and very happy life with.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I don&apos;t want you to fight the odds,</p>
          <p>the odds should always be on your side, and every step of your journey to make lasting contributions to Human Kind should be Honored, even before you get your Prize.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I want the world to work for you,</p>
          <p>not against you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And I don&apos;t want you to be alone like Elsie,</p>
          <p>and the countless many whose names we don&apos;t yet know, or may never know.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I know that there are people who will help you along the way,</p>
          <p>people who monitor those who aim the highest, and help them graduate, and get the job, and the lab, and all they need.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But maybe before you set of for that kind of greatness,</p>
          <p>you should consider Wisdom, Books and Adventure, Art and Music.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Become Wise first,</p>
          <p>and then see what your aims are, then.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Maybe you won&apos;t need to take that test,</p>
          <p>it&apos;s not like it is a real test of real knowledge.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="section">
          <p>And if you still need a lab,</p>
          <p>then why not build one, both for you and those brilliant many who discovered the odds against them to be too overwhelming.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>For you and Elsie,</p>
          <p>pure research, pure madness, raw talent.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Sometimes, when something stands in your way,</p>
          <p>it is a signal that you should build the path you wish you had, for others to walk it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Maybe the honest school,</p>
          <p>we all once needed?</p>
        </div>

          <p>There is a man in a video entitled &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPSvdKTEZug">What is the Appalachian Trail?</a>&quot;,</p>
          <p>who at 6 minutes and 27 seconds says:</p>

          <p>&quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPSvdKTEZug&amp;t=380">By the world standards I don&apos;t have anything, but I stand before you now and tell you, I&apos;m the richest man there is.</a>&quot;</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I think it maybe best that each Human Being should find their Wisdom and Enlightenment,</p>
          <p>before, setting their aims.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Rise First, and then help the world grow, and in a way that comes naturally to you, that completes you,</p>
          <p>where the path before you isn&apos;t against odds, but matches your unique predispositions for greatness.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It isn&apos;t really about that particular prize,</p>
          <p>is it?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is a call to greatness,</p>
          <p>it is a call directly to you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is meant to be answered in a way that fits you best,</p>
          <p>that makes you better and stronger.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Here you need not worry about odds,</p>
          <p>or interference from schools or labs meant to help you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And you get to read or listen to books that you pick,</p>
          <p>and not ones that are picked for you by strangers who can&apos;t even tell if any of it will be useful to you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I say,</p>
          <p>dream even bigger.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And if you must, then remember it is not just Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine,</p>
