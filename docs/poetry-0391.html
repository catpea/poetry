          <p>If you like adventure,</p>
          <p>eventually you will ask yourself about the big future.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Will we be able to ask Artificial Intelligence,</p>
          <p>to build better artificial intelligence, or will their thoughts have limits too?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>What will it be like when scientists cure aging,</p>
          <p>how will that change Humanity, will we immateriality take to the stars?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Will we Terraform nearby planets,</p>
          <p>or will it be genetic engineering that will allow people to settle there.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>One of the most shocking realizations is that the future humans must leave Earth,</p>
          <p>because of the sun, or ecosystem collapse.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is fair to say, that the future humans area Spacefaring Species,</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaOPDk8Xbgw">they have no choice</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And hen there is something else, if we have four billions years left on earth,</p>
          <p>think about how evolution transformed the Majestic Little Shrew into a Human.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It only took 65 million years, to go from mouse to great ape,</p>
          <p>and we have four billion years.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We will look as different from who we are today,</p>
          <p>as a chicken is from a dinosaur, as a mouse is from an ape.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Not to mention science,</p>
          <p>and all those other inventions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_udY35m3SdE">Seth Shostak</a> thinks that maybe <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvm7dB0mOic">advanced species load themselves up into computer programs</a>,</p>
          <p>after billions of years of dealing with artificial intelligence, we all get really good at computers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Chances are that the future humans have cybernetic enhancements,</p>
          <p>that some portion of the future brain, is stored on a chip.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It will happen, first to cure diseases, then to enhance clarity of thought,</p>
          <p>and quality of evening poetry - perhaps radio waves will be how we travel between near by stars.</p>

          <p>If feels weird to talk about things like that,</p>
          <p>doesn&apos;t it?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We are used to thinking of ourselves as ordinary,</p>
          <p>of our school, legal and political systems as something that we are improving, and it used to be a lot worse.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But a lot of that comes from,</p>
          <p>the comfort we take in our routines and so called ordinary lives.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But to call a Human, ordinary,</p>
          <p>is an oxymoron, a mistake, an error.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We are thinking beings,</p>
          <p>all extremely intelligent, tough like nails - or yes we are.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We are not ordinary,</p>
          <p>there is nothing ordinary about your mind.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It feels strange to think about futuristic things,</p>
          <p>because <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15axMs0yw8Q">we aren&apos;t of the culture to consider future enough</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But cure aging even if just with cry sleep,</p>
          <p>where we can wait out the next hundred years as in just leap into the future, where cure will be available, and our minds will alter.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Perhaps the biggest realization is that the difference between the modern human the beings we were ten thousand years ago,</p>
          <p>is Knowledge alone, that saying that Knowledge is Power, is an understatement, knowledge is how Humanity progresses forward.</p>
