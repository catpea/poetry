          <p>Sometimes writing journals becomes a chore,</p>
          <p>because page after page the darn thing begs for more.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Slowly it becomes a bore,</p>
          <p>and so as we grow, writing turns into a thing of yore.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I think, writing poetry is the best,</p>
          <p>as here your language takes you on a little quest.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>You can write very little and even in jest,</p>
          <p>and it still comes out with grrrreat zest.</p>
        </section>


        <section>
          <p>Moreover,</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>many do not wish to read long pages,</p>
          <p>as getting to the end would take them whooooole ages.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And, some may wish to read your thing twice,</p>
          <p>or may even wish to enjoy it thrice.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And here brevity is king,</p>
          <p>short little things are just the thing.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>So if it has been a long time since you writ,</p>
          <p>dig up your journal and lay down some fancy wit.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And if you never wrote before, you&apos;re in luck,</p>
          <p>lookup word families or find a a rhyming dictionary, and pluck!</p>
