          <p>Melodies should be composed by ear,</p>
          <p>wherever you start, wherever you are, it is always about finding the next note.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You should use a violin to make the sound,</p>
          <p>there is nothing more beautiful sounding than a lovely violin.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And just keep going until you make it till the end,</p>
          <p>make a whole song out of just the melody, and you will find what ever it is that you are looking for.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Before we begin composing our little melodies,</p>
          <p>I want to introduce you to the most beautiful song ever composed.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And the greatest, and most magnificent story ever told,</p>
          <p>and the story told is different for all of us.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The song is named, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyy0p90GO2w">Capriccio Italien</a>,</p>
          <p>and composed by Pyotr Tchaikovsky in 1880.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I think it contains all the secrets of music,</p>
          <p>it is a wonderful masterpiece to learn from about instrument composition.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Now, let us return to the task at hand and make a melody together,</p>
          <p>something with long notes and positive directions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Something non too cheerful,</p>
          <p>and non too sad.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The way I usually do this is by meowing first,</p>
          <p>and then following it up with an instrument like this:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>* initial call *</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Don&apos;t stop, when you find something that you like,</p>
          <p>keep going.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Let us add a second part,</p>
          <p>something more uplifting.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Before you add,</p>
          <p>you have to listen to what you have thus far, and then add something that makes it better.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>* a small extension *</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Everybody always teachers melody making to be about asking questions,</p>
          <p>and making answers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But we can do a lot better than that,</p>
          <p>in the third part of our melody we will call out to the universe out of loneliness.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is not a sad call,</p>
          <p>it is just a way to remind all the stars that we are here.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Here is how you speak to the universe:</p>
          <p>* an expression of feelings *</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And of course,</p>
          <p>our listeners will now expect an answer.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Now, of course, the universe has it&apos;s own voice,</p>
          <p>this does not mean that you abandon the violin, no, no, no, no.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It just means that in this moment in your melody,</p>
          <p>you will have to speak for the stars.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Sure, you may not agree with the way I think that stars speak,</p>
          <p>but since they are tiny little plops in the sky that are always all too far to get to.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>So, to me they make a plop sound - please don&apos;t laugh,</p>
          <p>and a music box - that in my mind is associated with going to sleep - is a neat interpretation of that.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>* the universe speaks back *</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And now we add a second violin,</p>
          <p>one that is more distant.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Whatever the stars of the universe say,</p>
          <p>the make the new voice respond.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I add distance by increasing the reverb and tail of the notes,</p>
          <p>and I make it different from the voice asking the question, by giving it a different tempo.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>* the friendly response *</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Here is our little melody in full,</p>
          <p>first I will play my meows, and then the instruments.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>* full song plays *</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
