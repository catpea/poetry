        <div class="section">
          <p>You need knowledge from books to expand your view of the world,</p>
          <p>you need to know more, you need hundreds of books.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You need a view of the world that comes from the books you chose,</p>
          <p>but is also correct as it balanced it self.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>As it corrected it self, just out of the number of books that you listened,</p>
          <p>and re-listened, and continue re-listening to.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I do not wish to concern you, but whatever you choose in life,</p>
          <p>also choose to become an Independent Entrepreneur just in case.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Nobody knows the troublemakers that we will encounter in our future,</p>
          <p>I once watched a very nice person invite a reporter to an event we were both volunteering in.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It later occurred to me, that he was collecting newspaper articles about him self,</p>
          <p>for years in the future, when he needed a promotion.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I just had to look up nepotism,</p>
          <p>and &quot;legacy ivy&quot;.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This is not something an ordinary honest person can go up against,</p>
          <p>now with social media, people probably pay agencies for posts, original articles, probably vacation videos, even.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This kind of thing is too complex to fight,</p>
          <p>and don&apos;t just assume that nepotism is about getting the job, because it may also be about people trying to push you out, to get you to quit.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Don&apos;t assume that this will happen to you,</p>
          <p>but don&apos;t assume that this will happen to somebody else.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Instead,</p>
          <p>slowly and calmly read and listen to your books and build up the knowledge required,</p>
          <p>to swiftly build your own company, have a plan for giving away free services to build a group of happy customers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Understand that this is not just about a product you would like to make, or a service you would like to provide,</p>
          <p>but mostly about customers that will reliably come to your product or service and gladly pay as they will honestly need it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And there is more,</p>
          <p>you need to get in touch with your elder self.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Begin asking &quot;What are your regrets?&quot;,</p>
          <p>just keep freaking asking that question until you whip yourself up out of whatever you are in, by your own shoelaces...</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I don&apos;t know how to say this, you know that you need real knowledge, like functional knowledge,</p>
          <p>not just &quot;performing on tests&quot; like an actor, which is what school will give you, so that they can take a paycheck home.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Real Knowledge is huge, you go home and start making stuff,</p>
          <p>sometimes stuff you didn&apos;t even know you could make, awesome.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But, then, wisdom will come to you, it happens, you get a good bull**t meter, and all your decision become good,</p>
          <p>you will smile and feel joy, and make stuff like paintings of philosophers, and their happy quotes, or something, and change lives of people, for better, for happier.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Somehow.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But there is more,</p>
          <p>because wisdom is something you hardly work for - I mean it comes to you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>So, what happens when you make a move forward, or up, or both...</p>
          <p>...what happens?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I think people observing someone taking that step,</p>
          <p>call it Greatness.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I am sure no person making that step ever called it that,</p>
          <p>but that is what others call it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And, I think that is where you need to go,</p>
          <p>discover your Knowledge, watch Wisdom Surround You, and then take that step.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Whatever it may be,</p>
          <p>others will call it Greatness.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The results that come from taking that step,</p>
          <p>are a very important part of your well-being, of the meaning of your life.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>When you finally become your elder self, and take a look back at your younger life,</p>
          <p>and probably still not be satisfied - I doubt anybody ever is.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But look at and feel that journey, and feel how heavy it was, how impossible those dreams,</p>
          <p>you will understand how important it was to make it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Looking back all the big decisions you made,</p>
          <p>may still even seem scary, but you will greatly appreciate having that foresight, that knowledge, having found that balance.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>A huge chunk of your accomplishments will come from enlarging your view with books,</p>
          <p>you&apos;ll feel it but may have difficulty pinpointing a set of books, it will just be having read many of them.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Let me put it in a way that approaches a vision of it,</p>
          <p>hundreds and hundreds of books, decades and decades of knowledgeable and wise decisions, and hundreds and hundreds more, and decades and decades more.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is impossible to arrive in a place that you feel uncomfortable in, when you just spend decades and decades,</p>
          <p>and read hundreds and hundreds of books, slowly and slowly, slowly and wisely making your way forward.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Take your time, but remember, our life is very long, much longer than you will ever expect,</p>
          <p>and that once you reach for real knowledge from real people who worked really had at it...</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>...and carry on in some part with knowledge gained from them,</p>
          <p>and from your beautiful life, and experiences as well.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="section">
          <p>You are sure to become wise,</p>
          <p>and then, you will be able to use that wisdom to help others.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And eventually make your elder self feel warm and cozy,</p>
          <p>probably in their 80s and 90s, as they cheerfully shuffle around.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Hey, you can&apos;t be sure, so don&apos;t say know,</p>
          <p>but they maybe painting something really beautiful, or typing on an ancient typewriter, to make it difficult to write the way I am writing right now.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>(Let me tell you, I already know what I am getting for my 90th birthday,</p>
          <p>this is my third poem today, the other two were to long, I try very hard to keep under 130 lines.)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Which brings us to the closing of this flight of poetic fancy,</p>
          <p>so let me just say it one more time, without mincing words, let me just say it:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>BECOME A GREAT BEING</p>
