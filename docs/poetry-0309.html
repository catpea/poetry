          <p>Scientists teach us to question everything, reproduce previous results,</p>
          <p>to be skeptical and free of biases, and never put opinion over fact.</p>

        <section>
          <p>And everywhere we are bombarded with falsehoods, broken promises, half-truths,</p>

          <p>All of this added together begs that we take control of our life,</p>
          <p>it is safer to think for ourselves, than to have somebody else think for us.</p>

          <p>Let us stop following advice,</p>

          <p>When we are told to become a Doctor or a Lawyer,</p>
          <p>let us turn the table around and reply:</p>

          <p>&quot;No, that&apos;s what you want,</p>

          <p>There are too many people that stand to get something out of you,</p>
          <p>if you listen to them, and do what they want.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>You have to do what you want, and the best way to figure out what that is,</p>
          <p>is by inheriting many lifetimes of knowledge from fascinating books.</p>

          <p>The wiser you become the more open gateways will appear before you,</p>
          <p>think by subtle analogy to your childhood, how small your world was back then, and how big it is now.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>With more wisdom your world will become even bigger,</p>
