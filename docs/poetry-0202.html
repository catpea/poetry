          <p>Once and for all, learn to see Your Life as a Whole,</p>
          <p>You only get one life, and that whole life is your life.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>The whole thing is yours,</p>
          <p>but you also have to become,</p>
          <p>Great Beings, Mountain Movers, and Mentors.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>The little ones need it,</p>
          <p>you have to teach them the height you rose to,</p>
          <p>so that they may continue,</p>
          <p>and not reset back to where you started,</p>
          <p>where it all started.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Governments, Laws, Institutions,</p>
          <p>Schools Universities and Constitutions,</p>
          <p>are Nothing compared to Your Heart, Your Wisdom.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Without Heart and Wisdom, all the machines we created out of paper and paper clips,</p>
          <p>and bureaucrats, and democrats, an all the lying rats,</p>
          <p>it all turns against us, and we are sent back a hundred years.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Back to war, concentration camps, bullet riddled buildings.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>By the powers of Universe we have access to all the future we want,</p>
          <p>but to advance forward we must teach, because lessons lost,</p>
          <p>come at a great cost, a cost to the little ones,</p>
          <p>your daughters and your sons.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>To Teach, we must become Wise,</p>
          <p>to become wise we must Learn,</p>
          <p>not merely age as if we are living in a cage,</p>
          <p>you are free to grow.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Grow to see it all,</p>
          <p>so that you may know gateway from a wall,</p>
          <p>so that the children may stand on the shoulders of giants,</p>
          <p>so that their future is that much closer.</p>
