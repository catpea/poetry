        <div class="section">
          <p>I parked at a little wooded rest area,</p>
          <p>I was already nearing Ludington I didn&apos;t need to stop.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But I had some tasty crackers with me,</p>
          <p>and I wasn&apos;t actually in any hurry to get anywhere at all.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This was early morning,</p>
          <p>and it is not possible to describe that early morning fragrance.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It was the middle of summer,</p>
          <p>and everything was blooming, everything was alive.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Mornings were especially thick with the scent of pine trees,</p>
          <p>and endless, endless deep and dark woods.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I put the key in the ignition, and my power inverter cheerfully tweeted at me,</p>
          <p>followed by the GPS babbling something about a turn.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Highway 31 ended, and in a split second decision, if you can call it that,</p>
          <p>I turned right on US 10, I was going to skip Ludington and head straight for Nordhouse.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I usually take North Stiles Road, until it ends at West Townline Rd</p>
          <p>and then I turn left onto North Quaterline Rd.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Here when I am headed straight for the wilderness,</p>
          <p>I turn left on West Nurnberg Rd which leads to a neat parking area.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This time I drive a little but further and did a left turn on West Forest Trail Rd,</p>
          <p>this leads to a day camp area if you keep going forward where the road changes name to Porter Creek.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But I took the well manicured left turn keeping on West Forest Trail Rd,</p>
          <p>and took it all the way until the end passing hundreds of happy campers and fancy sites.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I parked at the loop where the road ended, paid a few dollars for few days of parking my car,</p>
          <p>and set off for the Nordhouse Wildernes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I made it up the first hill, and sat down for a moment, a lovely couple walked by with a big dog,</p>
          <p>that was proudly trotting with a very funny little-backpack on.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I thought to myself, I&apos;d be happy too if I was carrying my snacks with me,</p>
          <p>alas, I ate mine at the rest area, which now seemed like a terrible mistake.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I waited a moment to let the couple go on ahead of me,</p>
          <p>so that they could have the wilderness to themselves.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Slowly put my backpack on, which was heavy, with all the water,</p>
          <p>and went on my way.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I was kind of half-heatedly looking for a nice site looking down from the top of the ancient dune,</p>
          <p>you know I got to tell you, there was this unusual cool breeze which in the warm air felt like a miracle.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The smell was even more beautiful, I think if I tried to describe it,</p>
          <p>I would end up crying, it is the fragrance of Happy and Healthy Nature.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I thought to my self if visitors from outer-space find this planet,</p>
          <p>many will just end up going hiking to all the world&apos;s destinations to just sniff the woods.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I switched my Audio Book from Seth Shostack&apos;s &quot;Search for Intelligent Life in Space&quot; lectures,</p>
          <p>to Bill Bryon&apos;s A Walk In The Woods.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It was only later that I found out that bears were re-introduced to Nordhouse,</p>
          <p>now that I think about it, it was probably on top of a bunch of bears quietly living there already.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It took a few moments to actually get to the sign that indicates that,</p>
          <p>this is the Nordhouse Wilderness Area,</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Few moments later the sites started popping up,</p>
          <p>you can see patches of well worn exposed dirt where hikers or hunters camp, they are all very nice.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Mine ended up being the second or third, it was small and beautiful,</p>
          <p>but to get there I had to descend down the ancient dune, not exactly an easy task with a heavy backpack on.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I set up my tent, and took to gathering up firewood for the evening,</p>
          <p>especially the chunky fallen logs which people usually can&apos;t carry as they can&apos;t chop them in pieces.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I bring a sharp saw, really sharp,</p>
          <p>and the dry fallen logs are much easier to cut and carry.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This time people dragged a huge fallen tree into the site,</p>
          <p>they were using it for sitting, so I used that for fire, and to clean up the site so that there is nothing left but dirt.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Not sure what time it was but the sun was still up high,</p>
          <p>so I set off for a long walk down the beach.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The dunes are very beautiful studded with big old trees,</p>
          <p>every-time you look you discover something different, a break in the tree line, or a sandy area where the dune parted for some reason,</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Or in this case an exceptionally tall stretch of dune,</p>
          <p>way taller than even I expected.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>When I got back from my sunny walk,</p>
          <p>I decided to walk the same distance, but now on the Arrowhead Trail in the woods.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I almost felt guilty about the beauty that was surrounding me,</p>
          <p>and then I made an amazing discovery.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>There was a fork in the trail that I have never noticed before,</p>
          <p>and the right path lead to a less worn trail that led up that gigantic dune I saw earlier.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Just as I was getting comfortable with being speechless about all the beauty around me,</p>
          <p>things became even more beautiful.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>To get to the top of the high dune you had to climb the cutest little trail,</p>
          <p>that dune could be one of the most beautiful features of Nordhouse.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And looking towards Lake Michigan you kind of see the lake in a new light as well,</p>
          <p>it looks, well, more beautiful from that height as you get to see more waves, and what seems like a more distant horizon.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>When I finally made it to the highest spot,</p>
          <p>I checked for ants and bears, and sat down on a log, speechless.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>When I finally took it all in, I had a drink of water,</p>
          <p>and of all the things, my phone beeped that it had a signal.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Happy with my discoveries, I begun my descent and just kept slowly walking back,</p>
          <p>I was going through a phase where I was re-listening to &quot;Electric Universe, The Shocking True Story Of Electricity.&quot; over and over.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>When I got to my camp, I just kept walking forward, as if it was a strangers tent down there,</p>
          <p>and I made it back to my car.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The amazing fact about the West Forest Trail Rd is that it&apos;s other end,</p>
          <p>is a gas station by a continuation of US 31, this is a whole new stretch.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The US 31 is connected by about four and a half miles of US 10,</p>
          <p>it is very strange, I just see them as two endings.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You don&apos;t need much when you live in the wilderness,</p>
          <p>some crackers, a bit of ice cream, and a sausage.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I paid for my snacks and cheerfully described to the employees my journey thus far,</p>
          <p>I had to hurry back it is a 10 mile drive but it is beautiful.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>When I made it back to camp, I hung up my food in the tree,</p>
          <p>even though in my experience there aren&apos;t any raccoons down there, and went down to m beach.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I circled around waiting for the sunset, probably found a fossil or two,</p>
          <p>and finally sat down to watch the sun put on a show.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It got a little bit cooler almost instantly,</p>
          <p>I took to lighting the fire and roasting my sausage on one of the twigs I found earlier.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>By the time all the stars came out I was already in my sleeping bag,</p>
          <p>watching them through the netting, as I fell asleep to the Electric Universe.</p>
