          <p>Hey! whew,</p>
          <p>it&apos;s only eight,</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>and here I was worried,</p>
          <p>that I am going to be late.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Today is Friday,</p>
          <p>and on every Friday I must look,</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>for new ideas,</p>
          <p>to add to my fancy <a href="https://westland-valhalla.github.io/warrior/">Warrior Book</a></p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>It is a book,</p>
          <p>made out of videos,</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>and some ideas,</p>
          <p>don&apos;t have enough of those.</p>

          <p>Last week,</p>
          <p>I searched for &quot;Ladies Fast Draw&quot;,</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>but it only returned three videos,</p>
          <p>last time I saw.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I also tried Women Sharp Shooting,</p>
          <p>and Compound Bow,</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>but something didn&apos;t fit,</p>
          <p>the chapter just didn&apos;t flow.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I am searching for</p>
          <p>inspirational things,</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>ideas that bring friends together,</p>
          <p>and give them wings.</p>

        <section>
          <p>I wrote that book to show all;</p>
          <p>that we all start slow,</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>but we can all become mighty,</p>
          <p>so as long as we give it a go.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>All too frequently we assume,</p>
          <p>that we have to have talent.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>and all the steps we take,</p>
          <p>must be naturally gallant.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>But the truth is,</p>
          <p>that we must fail to get there,</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>effortlessly succeeding at anything,</p>
          <p>is as boring as rare.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>No need to hurry,</p>
          <p>we can learn really slow,</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>the most important thing,</p>
          <p>is that we grow.</p>
