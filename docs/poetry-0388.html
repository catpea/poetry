          <p>Poetically speaking, it is a description of an anonymous voting mechanism,</p>
          <p>the peril is to be denied a second chance.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And the vote is about whether or not,</p>
          <p>the person&apos;s claim of Greatness is true.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>To spot a liar calming to be a Great Being,</p>
          <p>that is not very difficult.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But having traveled some distance,</p>
          <p>it probably means they don&apos;t like to have fingers pointed at them.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It probably means,</p>
          <p>they are not a very nice person.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>So imagine this noble round table that beacons to every troublemaker,</p>
          <p>and at the table sit great many Wise and Great Beings.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I imagine, true peril was that the troublemakers in search of more power,</p>
          <p>revealed themselves to the Wise and Great, who knew well, what it takes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>So the seat was a place that baited bad people,</p>
          <p>and made them reveal themselves to the Great Beings of the of Arthurian Legends.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Poetically asking, did truly great beings join the table by sitting in the Seat of Peril?</p>
          <p>legends aside, probably not, not really.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I think they would be invited by invitation and have a proper seat ready for them</p>
          <p>- the seat of peril was for the liars to reveal themselves.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And overall, the entire idea of the round table is in it self a powerful wisdom,</p>
          <p>the Great Beings do not wish to stand in the spotlight.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Whatever their calling, it is made a million times more powerful,</p>
          <p>if they are not the ones at the center of attention.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>A Million Human march,</p>
          <p>unlike its leader, cannot be stopped.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And the lesson,</p>
          <p>to learn from this is two fold.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Do not lead the change,</p>
          <p>because than you become a weak point of that noble pursuit.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>What you have to do,</p>
          <p>is inspire great many leaders, and encourage them to inspire more.</p>

          <p>Do not look towards liars, but when considering corruption in politics,</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The changes the world needs cannot happen by shining light on liars,</p>
          <p>they are too cunning for that.</p>

          <p>These Great Beings are not interested in coming together to lead the world,</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But you see what they are doing,</p>
