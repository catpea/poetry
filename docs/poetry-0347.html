          <p>We all have to be careful about what we end up believing in,</p>
          <p>and we have to be good to ourselves taking care of our minds and bodies.</p>

          <p>Our greatest flaw,</p>
          <p>is our susceptibility to indoctrination.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We have a tendency,</p>
          <p>to believe whatever it is that we are born into,</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We must get ahead of all that,</p>
          <p>we have to verify, we have to check our beliefs.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We have to make sure that who we become, come our golden age,</p>
          <p>does us justice, and that our world is good to us.</p>

          <p>We have to care about our mind,</p>
          <p>we have to take to self education.</p>

          <p>There is nobody we can trust, with our finest work,</p>
          <p>the content of our character.</p>

          <p>And we have to keep our stress levels to minimum,</p>

          <p>When you look at institutions, and governments,</p>
          <p>do not be disenchanted by how little progress they make.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Instead see that they are just little pebbles,</p>

          <p>Together, we have to build so big,</p>
          <p>that liars will be prevented from thriving in the systems we build.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>To make it move faster,</p>
          <p>the world needs more Understanding, more Wisdom, more Greatness.</p>

          <p>And that;</p>
          <p>is in your hands.</p>

          <p>It is the content of character of every generation,</p>

          <p>Countries can only make fast progress,</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>That is a journey we should all make,</p>
          <p>slowly, cheerfully.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And with the certainty of knowing that,</p>
          <p>this is the most enlightening and healthiest path.</p>
