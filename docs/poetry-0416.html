          <p>There isn&apos;t really much to explain on the subject,</p>
          <p>division feeds inequality.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And, f you live in a major city,</p>
          <p>then there is a nuclear warhead painted at it.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>There is no recovery from a nuclear strike,</p>
          <p>it overwhelms everything, and poisons everything else.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>So as long as humanity is divided,</p>
          <p>this type of sick behavior will never change.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We will be forever sending troops,</p>
          <p>over to parts of the world that fluctuate in decay.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Division, like poverty,</p>
          <p>is an anomaly, an error, a noose wrapped around humanity&apos;s head.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The way to stop war, it to prevent it,</p>
          <p>by spending decades building real schools that offer real education and safety.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>There cannot be such a thing as an enemy combatant,</p>

          <p>My Granda, the one that explained to me that &quot;war, is what men do&quot;,</p>

          <p>In English there is a similar adage that goes:</p>

          <p>That massive toxic cloud of poverty that hangs over humanity,</p>
          <p>can be converted to good because, destroying that poverty creates great energy.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>All you do, is design the worlds most beautiful, most artistic, and most intricate passport,</p>
          <p>give a digital copy to everyone, and sell the paper version for a few dollars.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In the back pocket of the passport,</p>
          <p>will be a credit card, linked to an empty account, in a bank of your won making.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>For the sake of protecting privacy,</p>
          <p>it shouldn&apos;t have a unique number, all cards just link to the same account.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And a flag,</p>
          <p>probably a pale blue circle that symbolizes unity of people of earth, and its future colonies.</p>

          <p>With every swipe of your card,</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Ad especially not for a man who was about to commit a crime,</p>
          <p>but gave it one more swipe with a deafening yelp... and... it... worked..., the card must work for him too.</p>

          <p>For every human being on Plant Earth,</p>

          <p>And when the border officials say &quot;We do not recognize The Union at this border&quot;,</p>
          <p>many will replay &quot;Fair is fair, as The Union does not recognize your border&quot;.</p>

          <p>Just like the borders,</p>
          <p>uneducation has been tearing the world apart.</p>

          <p>In the global state of uneducation,</p>
          <p>people do not understand that Police and Brutality are words on the opposite ends.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Police brutality, is a crime against humanity,</p>
          <p>a brutal police force is just a gang of thugs, it is no longer a force of goodness.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Tolerance or blindness towards a betrayal as evil as Police Brutality,</p>
          <p>will destroy all good will, erase it completely.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Police brutality is an oxymoron,</p>
          <p>and the wold can&apos;t see that without real education.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Real education does not test how good a person is at mathematics,</p>
          <p>it simply asks questions such as &quot;Should police brutality be tolerated?&quot;.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Those who respond in affirmative, have not yet learned enough to pass on to the next grade,</p>
          <p>and need help with finding better books, and more love towards our kind.</p>

          <p>There are many anomalies, weapons manufacturing, mutually assured destruction,</p>
          <p>climate denial, vaccine hesitancy.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>These anomalies hold Humanity back,</p>

          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You won&apos;t know how powerful your passport is,</p>
          <p>until you yourself hold it in your hand.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Until people everywhere start ordering it,</p>
          <p>and start swiping your card so often that computer networks will crawl under the strain.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>As terrible as it sounds today,</p>
          <p>&quot;INSUFFICIENT FUNDS&quot;, will slowly transform into a message of hope.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Every swipe,</p>
          <p>representing a new person&apos;s understanding of the error of poverty.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Every swipe casting a vote for a bank,</p>
          <p>that does not keep track of numbers, just hands out the money that the person requests out of the collective Genius, Love, and Foresight of Human Kind.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>May your hopes and dreams,</p>
          <p>works and adventures help Humanity grow, and may your name be honored for eternity.</p>
