          <p>I pulled up to the gate at Ludington State Park,</p>
          <p>it made no sense to get to the hiking sites this late, and I didn&apos;t want a camper spot, I grabbed a tent site.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I had to show the woman at the booth my Raccoon Drawings,</p>
          <p>she loved them, and I think I had a deer in there too.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I quickly explained to her,</p>
          <p>you need a cheap office projector, then use a photo editing program to help you find edges, and mid tones, and trace them.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

        <div class="section">
          <p>I drove in circles and circles, and some crazy fog I half remember,</p>
          <p>and finally found the tent sites, way, way, way down the road.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I setup my first, overpriced, extra light tent, and started the fire,</p>
          <p>I had my leather jacket on, it was cold in the evening.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I was probably listening to &quot;The Story of Philosophy&quot; by Durant,</p>
          <p>you have to listen to it dozens of times.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

        <div class="section">
          <p>There was a family camping behind me, their boy played a guitar,</p>
          <p>how do they do that I wondered.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>They made a couple of trips for fire wood,</p>
          <p>and we chatted a little.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I told the mom that it is really important that her boy listens to audio books,</p>
          <p>I showed her my iPod, and how you scroll the wheel to bring up the audio books.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>She asked if this is what I do,</p>
          <p>and then pointed at my car to change the subject.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>&quot;yeah&quot; - I said,</p>
          <p>simply.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I waived goodbye, and got into my tent,</p>
          <p>probably fell asleep to A Short History of Nearly Everything, Bryson is a kindred spirit.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I woke up, packed and left early in the morning,</p>
          <p>before the family could talk to me again.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I am not sure if she waited until Christmas with buying the iPod for her boy,</p>
          <p>I think not.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>There are too many books to be read,</p>
          <p>she set him up right after they got back, yeah she did.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I probably drove to Nordhouse for a few days,</p>
          <p>for a change of scenery.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I don&apos;t know why people judge me to be a Yellow Buttercup Pansy,</p>
          <p>a month after the three days that I planned to stay.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I ran into another mini-hiker who recognized from the parking lot the month before,</p>
          <p>this was on THAT steep hill in the middle of Arrowhead Trail.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>He was surprised to see me in the wilder-beast version,</p>
          <p>with three or four fanny packs, a huge and well warn Bushcraft KA-BAR, and a dank superman shirt.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>&quot;Dood?&quot; - He Said,</p>
          <p>to express his surprise that I also stayed there forever.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I drove my heavy walking log into the ground and pronounced:</p>
          <p>&quot;Though shalt pass&quot;, for that was about all the conversation I cared to have, I was listening to Paul Strathern&apos;s Philosophy in 90 Minutes series, it is good refresher.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Anyway, It was three times the conversation that he cared to have,</p>
          <p>but it was still kind of sad, it meant that the woods were crowded now.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I drove back home, but I didn&apos;t take the stuff out of the car,</p>
          <p>and I really appreciated the sand being everywhere, I like beach sand.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I drove back in a couple of months, I showed the lady at the booth, some more drawings,</p>
          <p>she asked me not to stop being an amazing artist, bless her heart.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This time I unpacked over a the hiking sites,</p>
          <p>I think I was re-listening to A Walk in the Woods by Bryson.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Whichever book has that damn paragraph about <a href="https://catpea.com/read/furkies-purrkies/220.html">that owl</a> swooping down,</p>
          <p>and freeing a man of his scalp, thinking it is a fury creature, an easy mistake to make when you fly, apparently.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Gosh, squeaking with that water pump,</p>
          <p>with the smell of my camp fire, the lake right over the dune Seth Shostack&apos;s &quot;Search for Intelligent Life in Space&quot; lectures playing and a nice sunset a moment before was very relaxing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In the morning I went to search for that shipwreck site, a man with a troop of cub-scouts walked up,</p>
          <p>and mumbled something, but I couldn&apos;t look away from his forehead - I was confused about what I was looking at.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Then he explained with a heavy heart, that the perfect sideways D on his forehead,</p>
          <p>is from his baseball cap that he had on backwards, I nodded carefully.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But, I didn&apos;t have a poker face back them, it is a recent talent,</p>
          <p>there is nothing I can do to remember what he was asking, but I am pretty sure I was listening to either Robinson Crusoe.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Shortly thereafter, I climbed up the dune,</p>
          <p>put my hands on my hips and proclaimed, &quot;it is time to go see what that little lighthouse is all about&quot;.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I put on &quot;The Science of Superheroes&quot;, hooked my shoes to my day-pack,</p>
          <p>and slowly begun walking the beach making plenty of stops for snacks.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It turned out there was a little apartment there,</p>
          <p>and they rented it out to the person that worked there.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="section">
          <p>And they had a whole bunch of little knick&#xB7;knacks for sale,</p>
          <p>I stared brainlessly at a postcard of the lighthouse I was in.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I don&apos;t know what conclusion I came to in regards to the post card was,</p>
          <p>but it certainly didn&apos;t involve wishing to make it my own.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The sunset,</p>
          <p>was perfect that day, not a cloud in the sky.</p>
