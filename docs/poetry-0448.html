          <p>Life, in large part is about becoming a noble, dignified, and thus great being;</p>
          <p>and later, helping the world grow.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I am sure someone, someday will simply explain,</p>
          <p>why so many things have gone wrong today.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It could be that nobody is really in charge,</p>
          <p>and the liars are keeping everything in a constant state of destruction.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It could be because of lack of education,</p>
          <p>and the thing that is disrupting education is the ongoing-uneducation, and fantasy beliefs and lifestyles.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Be it believing a falsehood, or pretending to know something,</p>
          <p>or having been mislead, it will all have lasting consequences as those things influence our decisions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It isn&apos;t always easy to pull our selves up and above,</p>
          <p>am I wrong to say; that finding a good book or a good friend; is... kind of a function of luck?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The unlucky, may never set themselves free,</p>
          <p>they may never come across something that is compatible with their mind; that will influence them to keep learning and rising.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Obviously, schools were meant to fix this,</p>
          <p>they were meant to teach us what is false, what is wrong, what isn&apos;t real, how parents shouldn&apos;t behave.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And school - really - should be our Shield and a Place of Wisdom,</p>
          <p>but it is actually a place of punishment, that frequently will cause parents to punish the student further.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This is an example of an interruption to growing up,</p>
          <p>our natural curiosity would have us do amazing things.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Observing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei">Jupiter&apos;s Moons, and Saturn&apos;s Rings</a>,</p>
          <p>through our own telescope, and that would be just one tiny step away from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcRKoxTPVg">taking pictures of the Andromeda Galaxy</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We would be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRvkaxh8EU">Composing Music</a>,</p>
          <p>it is unbelievably easy to compose beautiful melodies for the piano with a Digital Audio Workstation like the Open Source <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=lmms">lmms</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The world of Art would open it self to us as we put our photographs through basic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=GIMP+filters+tutorial">GIMP photo filters</a>,</p>
          <p>and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1fAWGTTFdY">project outlines of our art inspirations on walls or canvas</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Then our attention would turn to fixing Climate, fixing Politics, making World Peace a reality, ensuring <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTlrSYbCbHE">Human Rights</a>, and Fixing Schools,</p>
          <p>becoming Great Beings comes naturally to us.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Ba careful,</p>
          <p>if school is not teaching you for real.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If it is interrupting your real education,</p>
          <p>then it poses a danger.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You have to grow up in a culture where opinions can&apos;t stand up to a facts,</p>
          <p>where ineffective politics are seen as clear evidence of corruption.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You have to grow up in a world,</p>
          <p>that does not try to trick you into thinking that memorization is education... to make the job of collecting paychecks easier.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You have to grow up in a world that cares about the future,</p>
          <p>and thus consequences of actions that are taking place today.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You have to grow up in a world,</p>
          <p>that will protect you, and empower you to become a great being.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>There is a disgusting little saying in the country I come from,</p>
          <p>&quot;Co wolno wojewodzie, to nie tobie, smrodzie&quot;; it means &quot;A stinking little person can&apos;t do what a governor can.&quot;</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>That is the opposite, of the truth,</p>
          <p>it is a lie that is meant to belittle and intimidate the younger generations, and it automatically forfeits the authority of the persons spreading it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The truth is, to you; belongs the future,</p>
          <p>and by the time you get there; all that will be left of those governors, is the unforeseen consequences of their brainless actions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Consequences that in their lack of education, they were unable to foresee,</p>
          <p>consequences, that they will not be able, to deal with - and they will be too old to care.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>See the truth is, the future of Human Kind is more important,</p>
          <p>than any shortsighted vision.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>All the ongoing mistakes are unmovable,</p>
          <p>precisely because almost nobody is growing up to face the reality of the Future Human Kind.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>People are instead taught to deal and make deals,</p>
          <p>which only complicates problems like Climate Change, or our road to World Peace.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If your school is teaching you to pretend to learn by means of memorization,</p>
          <p>and to stop caring about the world, because it is not your problem yet.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Your first act of greatness is to quietly, and peacefully, resist a fake education,</p>
          <p>and go get a real one; presumably from Narrated Books that will ease you into complicated subjects.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Those who stand in the way of your real education,</p>
          <p>forfeit their authority over you, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmoor8DwqW4">as they are simply there to pretend to teach you and get paid</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Being your teacher is not just a job, bridging generations with Knowledge and Wisdom, is nothing like a job,</p>
          <p>and pretending to teach to merely get paid, is not only fraud, but a crime against Humanity, and The Future of Human Kind.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Not only do you have to resist fake education and make your way to get a real one on your own,</p>
          <p>you also have to help the others, prevent their growing up from being interrupted with fake education.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

          <p>you will lose if you try to stand up to them directly.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Move beyond, who is right and wrong, _do not_ waste time on broken things,</p>
          <p>begin your self education, immediately; and help your classmates if you can.</p>

          <p>Start slow, be gentle, you have much to learn, here are a few Authors and real Teachers to get you started,</p>
          <p>there are thousands of these magnificent individuals, and you will have to understand most of their thoughts and philosophy in order get a real, self balancing, and mutually reinforcing picture of the world.</p>
