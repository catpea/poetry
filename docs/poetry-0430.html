          <p>When you are sitting at your desk, in school,</p>
          <p>and the teacher is regurgitating textbooks to get you to pass tests.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And you have no idea what the heck he is taking about, and you are not inclined to understand that everyone else is lost too,</p>
          <p>and that the reason they are getting better grades than you, is because they aren&apos;t listening to comprehend, but to memorize.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Know, that he teacher can&apos;t rely on your comprehension skills,</p>
          <p>because they won&apos;t risk getting into trouble over your actual understanding.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>So what they will do, is look over the test you need to pass,</p>
          <p>and then feed you information that will help you pass if you blindly memorize it.</p>
        </div>

          <p>If you don&apos;t understand,</p>
          <p>that you are not supposed to understand.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If you don&apos;t understand,</p>
          <p>that you are only supposed to memorize to pass the tests so that they can put food on the table.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Then you are running the risk,</p>
          <p>of becoming convinced that you are unintelligent.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Which you are not,</p>
          <p>the world is just not understanding how badly schools are broken.</p>

          <p>You have to pay attention,</p>
          <p>to the broken things, and know when to walk.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>All the broken things are equally toxic,</p>
          <p>and you have to protect your mind.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Sitting in rows, while being spoon-fed timed lectures, from a one-for-all curriculum that does not see you as a unique human being with a colorful imagination,</p>
          <p>and then being graded down for not having temporarily-memorized it for long enough - is not an education, that&apos;s just fraud.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You are manipulated into cramming,</p>
          <p>so that the teacher can hold up the tests as evidence, that he is not a fraud.</p>

          <p>There are no standardized humans,</p>
          <p>there cannot be a standardized assessment.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Even in prestigious universities, and medical schools,</p>
          <p>a standardized assessment can only asses the height you are standing on, while cutting out the entire being that you are.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In average schools, a standardized assessment can only asses,</p>
          <p>whether or not you have given up who you are, under the stress of being held back, and laughed at.</p>

          <p>There are no bad grades,</p>
          <p>you either understand something or not.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>A bad grade is a nail in the coffin of a school,</p>
          <p>it reveals its own fraud - and blames it on you.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>A school could be built to do you and your classmates justice,</p>
          <p>but it would be an unstructured series of games, levels that would require actual study.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And when you fail to progress,</p>
          <p>nobody would know about it.</p>

          <p>It would not be the final test,</p>
          <p>you&apos;d find a better book and get to the bottom of what had you stuck.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Only your progression forward would matter,</p>
          <p>you would never be punished for learning what you like at your own pace.</p>

          <p>Graded fantasy education that trick you into unforgivable-debt is an insult with a curse,</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is a road that will slowly meander towards wisdom,</p>

          <p>Scientists are taught to question everything,</p>
