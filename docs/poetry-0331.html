          <p>I still have a world to go before I feel comfortable dancing to my dance songs,</p>
          <p>I have no other choice, in a few day every Cutting Shape song will go bad on me.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I danced to my own music before,</p>
          <p>but it was just drums and samples, it wasn&apos;t anything fancy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>For the past couple of days I&apos;ve been searching for &quot;Techno Tutorials&quot;,</p>
          <p>whatever it is that I am learning, I always search for THING + the word tutorials.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>That&apos;s how I learned my early programming languages,</p>
          <p>one exception was art, it just came to me one day to point an Office Projector on oil canvas.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

        <div class="section">
          <p>Three months ago, I searched for &quot;Shuffle Dance Tutorial&quot;,</p>
          <p>I think that is my favorite one, I feel amazing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Whenever a tutorial talks about something,</p>
          <p>there is a strong hint of a procedure.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Unlike in a school lecture,</p>
          <p>that has no rhyme or reason, and plenty of noise.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Thus far my favorite video is:
          </p>
          <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18HxK2lVhY">How to produce Techno #1 - The Basics, by Dash Glitch on YouTube</a></p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I don&apos;t know the program he is using,</p>
          <p>I am just re-creating the things he talk about with <a href="https://lmms.io/" title="lmms: Cross-platform music production software">lmms</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And I learned how to use lmms by just expecting a canvas that will help me arrange song structure,</p>
          <p>and then wanting to see a piano roll, and a beat sequencer.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The need for piano roll and beat sequencer</p>
          <p>came from a tutorial on <a href="https://learningmusic.ableton.com">https://learningmusic.ableton.com</a></p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>So first I looked at how to make beats and melodies,</p>
          <p>and then practiced with the free lmms program, and now I am breaking down techno.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I already made a tiny test song this afternoon,</p>
          <p>and in deed following the Dash Glitch procedure will create a unique techno song each time.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Once I feel comfortable with that,</p>
          <p>I will move on to create dance friendly songs, which is still basically techno.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Without the procedures that Dash Glitch and many other YouTubers present,</p>
          <p>the songs come out too rough.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But by taking the same steps they are, and paying attention to the same details,</p>
          <p>following the general procedure they reveal, it only takes a few minutes to make a new song.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>So open up the internet, type in whatever you are interested in learning, followed by the word &quot;Tutorial&quot;,</p>
          <p>and I am certain it won&apos;t take you very long to show amazing progress.</p>
