          <p>You can&apos;t leap into whatever you conceive Enlightenment to be,</p>
          <p>it is built layer by layer, step by step, and year by year.</p>

        <section>
          <p>We all need might, never has a creature been alive that didn&apos;t need strength,</p>
          <p>and waiting until the last moment; is a bad idea, anyway.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>That&apos;s why people run marathons,</p>
          <p>this is why people challenge themselves with practice.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>So that when life becomes a challenge,</p>
          <p>for all the finish lines they crossed, failure won&apos;t cross their mind.</p>

          <p>A self challenge, is a practice of strength,</p>
          <p>it is good for us.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>It is different challenges for different people,</p>
          <p>at different places in their lives.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>But there is one thing they all have in common,</p>
          <p>whatever they set off to do, it seems impossible at first.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>That&apos;s what the hard parts of life are like,</p>
          <p>they seem like an impassible challenge at first.</p>

        <section>
          <p>Practice makes us strong,</p>
          <p>difficult challenges help us grow, and help us think too.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>It is all for life,</p>
          <p>it is all for enlightenment.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>It is all for living above the common levels of life,</p>
          <p>it is all for knowing that no matter the challenge, we will find a way.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>May we all grow wise, and strong, and healthy,</p>
          <p>may we each find a mountain to move and inspire a generation.</p>
