        <div class="section">
          <p>Umm, sitting here,</p>
          <p>and Ohhhhh Dear.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I have destroyed two LED lights and I had to mellow,</p>
          <p>as I killed a beautiful Green and Magical Yellow.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I was building my first electrical circuit thing,</p>
          <p>and I wanted to _ssssimplify_ all the wiring.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I didn&apos;t know I _trully_ needed a resistor on the line,</p>
          <p>but I was smart enough to pay attention to the plus sign.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It was in the blood flowing through my veins,</p>
          <p>to know the longer leg marked all the electron gains.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And you know, it glowed for a little bit,</p>
          <p>it made me think I made it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But then darkness came,</p>
          <p>as the little LED died, _currrrsing_ my name.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>My third light is still glowwwwwwing,</p>
          <p>and now I can sense the electrons cheerfully flowing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But, shoot, I don&apos;t actually know how to calculate the needed resistor yet,</p>
          <p>I am kind of waiting for my third LED to get upset.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I am poking the resistor I did plug in there with my finger, hoping not to make it pop, or yeet,</p>
          <p>well, I know that the electrons it stops turn to heat.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I could increase the voltage to 5,</p>
          <p>but I expect the LED won&apos;t survive.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But you know what, I love it, I love it so deeply,</p>
          <p>and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01IH4VJRI/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_image_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">the whole thing was just 11 dollars</a> - I bought it very cheaply.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Even thought my LED is not very bright,</p>
          <p>it is not dim as I am, about the source of my glowing delight.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I _know_ I used the wrong resistor number,</p>
          <p>but it has not fallen yet to that perpetual dark slumber.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I poked the resistor to run another test,</p>
          <p>I didn&apos;t get shocked, I must say I am impressed.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Gosh, I am impressed with my new curiosity,</p>
          <p>even though the circuit I created is only little short of atrocity.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I learned something from the way my resistors are numbered,</p>
          <p>R is the same as &#x3A9;, as you can&apos;t type &#x3A9; without being encumbered.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I also have an 1 &quot;M&quot; resistor packet,</p>
          <p>that puts it the 1,000,000 &#x3A9; resistor bracket.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Even though I don&apos;t have an engineering degree,</p>
          <p>I keep admiring at my beauuuuutiful and dangerous LED.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I just tried a 10 &#x3A9; resistor and I think the LED seemed somewhat brighter,</p>
          <p>but it didn&apos;t burn out, I think this one is a real fighter.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Dangerously, I tried a 100, 220, and 330 &#x3A9;,</p>
          <p>even though I am sitting here all lonely at home.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But I am OK,</p>
          <p>I did finally get it noticeably dimmer and made my day.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Yeah, 51,000 &#x3A9; and the electrons didn&apos;t like that at all,</p>
          <p>it certainly looked like they were hitting a wall.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But we do have a huge problem, here to my favorite subject we turn,</p>
          <p>because messing with wires is how you _really_ learn.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I didn&apos;t calculate the &#x3A9; I needed on purpose _and_ frankly, out of spite,</p>
          <p>because learning formula-first is stupid, it is real blight.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Once you burn out your LED,</p>
          <p>and figure out that a resistor will set you free.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You whip the resistors out on the table,</p>
          <p>and frankly _ignore_ the god damned label.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You just go in a sequence and play like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell">Maxwell</a> did,</p>
          <p>_you want to notice_ the external properties like a curious kid.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You have to get stuck,</p>
          <p>and then set yourself free and run amok.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Just use a battery, so that you don&apos;t end up being permanently blocked,</p>
          <p>by getting horribly shocked.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Remember, at first, try it all by yourself,</p>
          <p>at first _leave_, all the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeCh68a1GEg">books on the shelf</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You are just as much of an inventor as all the greats were,</p>
          <p>you should absolutely become an entrepreneur.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You genius _needs_ you, so without any further adieu,</p>
          <p>get yourself a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00066ZZO4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">multimeter</a> too.</p>
