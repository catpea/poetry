          <p>Philosophy, and her Daughters the Sciences, are a way to put ourselves to words,</p>
          <p>they are a means of storage, transfer, and communication.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>Philosophy is a thin outer layer of the Human Mind,</p>
          <p>of the Human Condition, of the Raw, Unleashed, Human Consciousness.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>Within, Rises The Human,</p>
          <p>The Source of Raw.</p>

          <p>The only flaw,</p>
          <p>is us becoming convinced we are small.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>That&apos;s why we have each other,</p>
          <p>I remind you, you remind your granddaughter, she reminds those in need.</p>

          <p>And the Triumph continues,</p>
          <p>The Triumph, is an unbroken line through the past.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>Like an eraser it runs over nations that take freedom,</p>
          <p>wiping out corrupt politicians for the specks of dust they are.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>It a bone shaking scream it runs through the blind judge,</p>
          <p>it strikes nightmares in those who treat men as animal.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>It pierces the hearts of animals that recruit unprepared kids to teach them how to become &quot;men&quot; in war,</p>
          <p>it carves, the predatory weapon manufactures that turned air to acid for a profit.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>It strikes right through the slavers burning them to dust,</p>
          <p>the lawless beg in their last moments as the village heroes rise.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>And the wolves run and hide under our very own blankets,</p>
          <p>made of the snarling bear skins from last week.</p>

          <p>History of the Human Kind,</p>
          <p>will always be writ and washed by prevalent powers.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But that will always be a surface story,</p>
          <p>because in the face of the future the truth is always revealed.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You are easily capable of becoming countless times more,</p>
          <p>than the heroes described in the books.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>By subtle analogy to whatever our triumphs are,</p>
          <p>we can see all the other triumphs for what they really were.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>By the very power that expands our wisdom,</p>
          <p>we grow to no end.</p>
