        <section>
          <p>Every way of thinking about the world,</p>
          <p>brings us closer together, despite, what we are told.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>There is just one little thing to keep in mind,</p>
          <p>we have to leave all the bad ideas, behind.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Exchange of ideas came a long way,</p>
          <p>but we still need to eliminate foul play.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Because not everyone is educated,</p>
          <p>and without wisdom life gets complicated.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Misinformed people are easily swayed,</p>
          <p>they are often unprepared, and very scared.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>If we build to remove their fears,</p>
          <p>they will love us... to tears.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>The most powerful early-tool is the Audiobook,</p>
          <p>wisdom delivered in a way that&apos;s hard to overlook.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>It is private, and comes with no shame,</p>
          <p>it can take a person from poverty to Hall of Fame.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And the best type of things to listen to,</p>
          <p>are memoirs or lectures, that enlarge a world view.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>We must stop bad education from tearing us apart,</p>
          <p>we each have to learn, and become smart.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>This day of Wisdom, and Peace that we yearn,</p>
          <p>comes closer each day that we learn.</p>
