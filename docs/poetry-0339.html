        <div class="section">
          <p>It is hard not to love when Composers mix ancient and modern instruments,</p>
          <p>in this tutorial I will also throw in a hint of beat-boxing to the mix.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The first unusual sound that caught my attention was the steel drums in Commando,</p>
          <p>every time I hear them, they stick out like crazy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You can hear it really well in:</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbCugaxxANc" title="Drive Away From Pier, Commando Soundtrack by James Horner">Drive Away From Pier</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Jammes Horner the Composer and Conductor was apparently creating a tie in with the island battle at the end of the movie,</p>
          <p>but since I was just paying attention to the guns and action it seemed really odd to me.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I think Jammes Horner just loves Steel Drums,</p>
          <p>and I completely understand him, because I love them too, especially in an orchestral setting.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Most recently however, it the soundtrack to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw_o7XUX3fg">Wonder Woman</a>,</p>
          <p>that really impressed me with the drum work, it is just really serious, clean, orchestral and just beautiful to me.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The addition of the guitar is really nice too,</p>
          <p>the mixing of the ancient war drum and the modern electric guitar is just perfect.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Most notably it was a song named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQsLmEwozGM">The Dream, from Total Recall by Jerry Goldsmith</a></p>
          <p>that awakened something in me, I listened to it countless times, even recently.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is of some note that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=830I9w7I7wM">Hans Zimmer&apos;s use of that horn</a>,</p>
          <p>is something that I feel is related to all this, as that horn fits really well in songs that mix modern and ancient.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I also want to add an honorable mention here <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ve6wEmeQDk">Jerry Goldsmith&apos;s Main Title to Rambo First Blood Part II</a>,</p>
          <p>is so beautiful that it has a life on its own far beyond any of those movies.</p>
        </div>

          <p>Let us not delay any longer and compose something new and old,</p>
          <p>I didn&apos;t just want to re-create sounds from my past for this song.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>So I am going to show you how our voice can become an instrument too,</p>
          <p>I made a quick list of interesting sounds we can make and made a recording of it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Here is what that sounds like:</p>
          <p>Boom, Bounce, Cha, Cyk, Da, Dum, Kisss, Ks, Ksh, Ksz, Pff, Pow, T, TC, Tch, Th, Ts, Tsh, Tss, TT</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I didn&apos;t use all of them in the song,</p>
          <p>I used just enough to give a little tribal flavor to the whole piece.</p>
