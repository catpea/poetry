        <div class="section">
          <p>We should all learn how to sing,</p>
          <p>I know it is very difficult to get going, but maybe I can help.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You will need a computer, a microphone, headphones,</p>
          <p>and a free and open source program called Audacity</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Find a song you like, something that you might have wished to sing before,</p>
          <p>and try to sing the lyrics, while you are listening to it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We all have a talent for singling along,</p>
          <p>so focus on the sounds in your headphones and follow the lyrics.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Your first recording, may be a little underwhelming,</p>
          <p>but, you need to record the song four times.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In Audacity, just keep adding New Tracks as you go,</p>
          <p>and make sure they all align.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If yo have imported the song into audacity,</p>
          <p>make sure to turn on Overdub (under Transport / Transport Options ).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Here is my first attempt at a song from my childhood, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Tank-Men_and_a_Dog">Czterej Pancerni I Pies</a>,</p>
          <p>I didn&apos;t listen to it live, I would just play the song, and a second later, repeat the lyrics.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>* NON-SYNC VERSION *</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And <a href="/audio/czterej-pancerni.mp3" title="Czterej Pancerni I Pies A Capella">here</a> is the version I listened to live,</p>
          <p>basically singing in sync with the original performer.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Not only is my self-quartet more in-sync,</p>
          <p>but my singing is properly spaced to match the song.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>* SYNCED VERSION *</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Don&apos;t worry is there is a little bit of silence here and there,</p>
          <p>it is just part of the performance.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>While three or four tracks are enough for creating a neat a cappella effect,</p>
          <p>keep singing, keep re-recording the lyrics, and paying more attention to how you sing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The biggest deal about learning to sing,</p>
          <p>is starting with something that is already beautiful, mixing your first four recordings will make them perfect.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Here is a song in English language to demonstrate the four voice a cappella effect slightly better,</p>
          <p>I sing <a href="/audio/meow-world.mp3" title="Mad World A Capella">Mad World</a> originally written and performed by Tears For Fears, it is one of my favorite songs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>(I have to warn you as it is a little bit sad,</p>
          <p>still the lyrics are very beautiful, and I had an amazing time singing it.)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>* MAD WORLD PLAYS *</p>
