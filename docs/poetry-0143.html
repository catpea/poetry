          <p>Growing up, getting up, moving up, rising up,</p>
          <p>we each have this abstract sense of a special direction.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>It calls to us when we are down,</p>
          <p>and it calls when we <strong>can</strong> go higher.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>You don&apos;t even need to speak a language,</p>
          <p>just lift you finger and point to the sky.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>It works for everything and every time,</p>
          <p>it encourages us to continue to rise.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>There is always an up,</p>
          <p>and never an end in sight.</p>

          <p>Growing up demands that we open our eyes and rise,</p>
          <p>stand our ground and look to the skies.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>So as long as we aim for the tallest of mountains and rise,</p>
          <p>our knowledge will quickly catch up in size.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Wherever we begin, we <strong>can</strong> rise,</p>
          <p>to grow in wisdom to no end, <strong>is</strong> the ultimate prize.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>May we each discover our path to wisdom and rise,</p>
          <p>cheerfully becoming mighty and wise.</p>
