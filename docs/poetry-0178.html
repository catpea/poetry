          <p>There are so many ways to inherit wisdom.</p>
          <p>But, the best we can do, in chaos, and noise, and haste, and poverty, is books.</p>

          <p>To the Cries of the Philosophers,</p>
          <p>the schools have become heartless machines.</p>

          <p>Processing plants, pushing humans along,</p>

          <p>Just, say, no, because you are not that simple, and your life is too precious,</p>

          <p>Go to the library, find a way to find all the Audio Books that will move you,</p>

          <p>Oh, it cost them all the worthless grades, and all the office space and windows one could ever wish for,</p>
