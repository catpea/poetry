          <p>Every adventure has its own unique song,</p>
          <p>and you have to listen to it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You have to do as it tells you to do,</p>
          <p>only then will the adventure become good.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>When the lake is cold, and you need a bath,</p>
          <p>there is no better time to yell bad words then when you take the dip.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>When the trail seems to resume at every corner, you never stop,</p>
          <p>you keep going forward until you discover the very end.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And when you are 10 mines away from civilization and it gets suddenly hazy,</p>
          <p>that&apos;s the rain the clouds warned you about, and that&apos;s when you put your hood on...</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>...and keep going,</p>
          <p>so as long as you are cozy and cheerful, you keep on trucking.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The reward, the bounty,</p>
          <p>is a treasure chest of all kinds of colorful gems.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You&apos;ll be granted a shower,</p>
          <p>by Mother nature her self, the seasons is how you turn up the heat.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You will become a happy curiosity, in the curious minds of countless many motorists,</p>
          <p>as they wonder if it was rain that caught you, or if it was you that caught the rain.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You&apos;ll sleep better, you may dream of cozy places,</p>
          <p>and you&apos;ll be more rested in the morning.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And somewhere in all the haste of ducking under the occasional tree,</p>
          <p>to hide from sudden downpours, you&apos;ll snap a cute photo.</p>

          <p>It is no different than searching for the next note,</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is no different, than sitting down on a bench, with a well proportioned sketch,</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section">
