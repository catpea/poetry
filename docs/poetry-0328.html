          <p>We learn to avoid trouble,</p>
          <p>and to have something to say.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>By writing books, or composing audio books,</p>
          <p>we become a bit more magnificent.</p>

          <p>Learning music composition,</p>
          <p>is a good example of learning in general.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Above all, our education has to be fun,</p>
          <p>and full of color, dance and foolishness.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

        <div class="section">
          <p>Tell me that this is not a beautiful wisdom,</p>
          <p>imagine learning math with joy, lasers, graffiti, and drones.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>How long would it take you to grok the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVAdqcQ4jzM">formulas</a>,</p>
          <p>if you could see the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-LfLW9Kgis">forces</a> with your eyes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>To get rid of the abstractions you only need to examine <a href="https://github.com/Jam3/math-as-code">math-as-code</a>,</p>
          <p>and then search for JavaScript and Node.js tutorials, to fly the drones via software.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In all the haste you won&apos;t even notice you never leaned how to solder,</p>
          <p>and yet you built dozens of drones out of Raspberry Pis and various drone components.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>How about being the first person to send an unmanned solar powered drone,</p>
          <p>across the ocean, both ways, Key West to Paris, and back, and then some.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And as a bonus the drone lands in the ocean as it recharges its batteries,</p>
          <p>and runs away from anything trying to approach it, tweeting along the way.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Music is something that is beautiful to learn,</p>
          <p>because it tickles your ears.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>For math and electronic engineering to tickle your ears,</p>
          <p>you need more than a speaker, you need boxes of old drone components, and some Raspbery PIs...</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And at least one project involving the creation of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg_JcKSHUtQ">huge freaking artificial albatross</a>,</p>
          <p>with a targeting system that could gag a mountain goat from a hundred feet in the air, with shall we say, a dielectric payload.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdNAUJWJN08">such a tragedy</a> that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzSnvxejenY">school is probably faking teaching</a>,</p>
          <p>and nobody can really tell, probably because nobody knows what a real education is really like.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I don&apos;t think it is an intentional conspiracy,</p>
          <p>I think what it is an emergent scholastic mediocrity.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>One that emerges out of things like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hh6uHUx728">dance of lemons</a>,</p>
          <p>and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmtEiOs50u0">intrinsic paternalism (whatever the hell that means)</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But all you have to do to push this mediocrity back,</p>
          <p>is accept responsibility for your own education, and that is something you should do anyway.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Finally, I just want you to know that everyone is a genius, especially you,</p>
          <p>and that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzSnvxejenY">grades are fake</a> and they don&apos;t matter, they are not a judge of you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Maybe you could try to help the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9M4tdMsg3ts">Valedictorians</a> with their speeches,</p>
          <p>learn to speak out, yourself, inspire your friends accept the responsibility for their own education too, maybe launch some start-ups.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="section">
          <p>I am not sure how serious this problem is,</p>
          <p>but I trust in the wisdom of people like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17fbxRQgMlU">Sir Ken Robinson</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_EgdShO1K8">Noam Chomsky</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I suspect that, it is probably time to stop memorizing and cramming for tests, and figure out what real education _really_ is,</p>
          <p>because _pretending_ to have learned, is very likely one of the major forces behind the fake schooling we see today.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Don&apos;t drop out, don&apos;t make it easy for lemons and liars and don&apos;t let them win,</p>
          <p>don&apos;t let anybody trick you out of a real education, growing up is sacred.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Figure out what is broken,</p>
          <p>and build a company to try to fix it, help the world grow.</p>
