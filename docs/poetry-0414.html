          <p>It is difficult to try to give advice,</p>
          <p>that dictates the life ahead, of someone else.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Personally, I would not take out a school loan,</p>
          <p>even if theoretically it would only take four years to pay it off.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>To me, those four years matter,</p>
          <p>as well as the ten years of mounting debt that lead up to it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I can easily imagine people who don&apos;t care about the debt,</p>
          <p>and they don&apos;t even notice when they pay it off.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>By that time, they become a successful Doctor in their community,</p>
          <p>they are admired, and often go on fantastic adventures.</p>

          <p>In my mind, the schools must pay their students,</p>
          <p>a student should never be put in the position of debt.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Especially student debt that can go up to a million dollars and cannot be forgiven by bankruptcy,</p>
          <p>there are no guarantees in life, we are too beautiful to be crushed by mounting pressure.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Plus, it is not just about Medical Students or West Point Officers,</p>
          <p>this practice of putting students in unforgivable debt, applies to a person who just wants to have a nice college diploma.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Student debt is an error,</p>
          <p>it is not fair for the older generation to stress the future of the world.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>On top of that, a job or a career,</p>
          <p>is just a little thing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Our ultimate aim in life,</p>
          <p>is to become a great being making lasting contributions and leaving an inspirational legacy behind.</p>

          <p>Life is a one way road,</p>
          <p>you can only amplify forward, and you can&apos;t ever go back.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>All those shortcuts prized by many, really do work,</p>
          <p>but in the most terrible of ways.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The wishes of skipping over the hard things,</p>
          <p>are granted, as if by the twisted mind of a genie.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>A solid shortcut will bridge the youth with old age,</p>
          <p>and make the one doing the skipping none the wiser.</p>

          <p>As it often is,</p>
          <p>the world too has a few tricks up its sleeve.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Just like I didn&apos;t know to call for help when my bullies came,</p>
          <p>because I said to myself, it is my fault, I am fat, I have bad grades, and I wont&apos; fight them.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Terrible <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmoor8DwqW4">things will conspire against you too</a>,</p>
          <p>and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxyKNMrhEvY"></a>it is hard to catch them before they happen, it all too easily flies over our heads.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Already, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddPA56gVxz0">you are likely to be tricked into thinking that education is a chore</a>,</p>
          <p>and likely, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okpg-lVWLbE">you have failed to notice that schools are not functioning</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>That is what you are up against,</p>
          <p>not only lack of knowledge and experience, but also and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqTTojTija8">overwhelming mediocrity and incompleteness</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Incompleteness of things that you are taught to trust,</p>
          <p>and would not ordinary think to question.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Moreover, things are already being stolen from you,</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HndV87XpkWg">your insight, your brilliance and energy</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7C51N1jQoUE">People in authority may try to force you to follow a pre-made way of thinking</a>,</p>
          <p>rather than to encourage you to discover your own, your own path in life is sacred.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And then there are the numbers,</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryxh-Pd9dJU">the statistics that reveal the broken promises</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Though it has been a long time,</p>
          <p>I still remember feeling that school has been made artificially difficult.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Trickery,</p>
          <p>to convince us that it is hard work that works out, if you work hard.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

        <div class="section">
          <p>I want you to imagine,</p>
          <p>playing with programming for several years.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And then really try to visualize,</p>
          <p>the overwhelming pleasure and excitement, of going to a programming school, having already learned almost everything on your own.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>What can be more pleasant,</p>
          <p>then a refresher course that meanders through things you enjoy anyway.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And if you forgo the diploma,</p>
          <p>all you need to launch your first start-up is what you have learned on your own.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Going to a school that deal with a specific subject, especially when you are already well educated on the subject,</p>
          <p>is what the real school should feel like, learning on top of what you already know, extending your unique strengths.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>A school that punishes,</p>
          <p>is just fraud.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

        <div class="section">
          <p>One of the most <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY2l2xfDBcE">painful observations</a> for me,</p>
          <p>is the fact that if we get good at microbiology, we will still fail biology exams.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The range of questions in standardized education is not realistic,</p>
          <p>it is nothing like learning programming, and then passing all the software development exams at a coder school.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In the average school,</p>
          <p>you still fail if you are good at something.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The notion of standardized knowledge,</p>
          <p>one arranged by uneducated politicians seeking reelection or promotion is an insult, an affront to the entire world.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Pretending to educate has real world consequences,</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09t_7ZgVjLE">lack of real education is a terrible curse</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We must reject what is broken,</p>
          <p>and we must learn to reject the shortcuts.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>A school that is not educating its student for real,</p>
          <p>is not worth going to even if it offers a diploma, and some promise of a job.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Fraud, is fraud,</p>
          <p>it will take you nowhere, and probably put you in unforgivable student loan debt.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Abz9qgi9FKg">Student loan debt is a terrible mistake that must be considered in full ahead of time</a>,</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NzgMqIbZc8">debt is no fun and it takes a lot of joy out of life</a>.</p>

          <p>Real knowledge, real education, must come first,</p>
          <p>even if it is self education that then requires going through a program to get it certified.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Real education leads to Knowledge and Wisdom,</p>
          <p>towards love of life, and it offers a path towards greatness.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We have to learn to get ahead of those who will trick us,</p>
          <p>or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBwlBdpKSg">things that will put us in debt</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And we have to learn to jump ahead of ourselves,</p>
          <p>and ask our elder selves what their regrets are.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>While it may feel that everyone is selling a different version of a solution,</p>
          <p>world&apos;s top selling - and beloved - non-fiction books, are still the best way to inherit true wisdom.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Best selling books, are in a way voted on by the entire humanity, or entire nations,</p>
          <p>and the overwhelming majority of those books, and especially those that reference each other hold true wisdom.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In an age where we can easily get at the narrated versions,</p>
          <p>it can&apos;t be any easier to accept responsibility for a fine and well balanced self education that fits who we are.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In a world where schools are not teaching,</p>
          <p>you will have to educate yourself ahead of time, and only then should you move forward.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Going into a school that is not teaching,</p>
          <p>and hoping to graduate, is a mistake.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But, even if you do have a great school,</p>
          <p>the idea that it will put you into unforgivable debt for any length of time, and in a world that comes with few guarantees - rings an alarm bell.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

        <div class="section">
          <p>Your life must be lived stress free,</p>
          <p>more than that, it should be lived beautifully.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The journey that real education represents,</p>
          <p>is one of the most beautiful things we will experience in life.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Our progression forward,</p>
          <p>is similar to how a flower grows and then blooms.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is very important that the flower is allowed to grow free,</p>
          <p>and not be put through stress or drought.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Finally, as much as there is to be said about career choice,</p>
          <p>where, we work, is not everything.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>That we grow up and bloom as Great Beings,</p>
          <p>and make lasting, positive, and meaningful contributions to the Human Kind is the thing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>A job of career by contrast,</p>
          <p>is just a little thing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And remember that poverty is an error,</p>
          <p>that it is not students who should pay school, but schools and employers that should pay students for the privilege of making their institutions better.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Not only that, but a wise world, a just world, is a world that practices the prevention of stressing or fracturing of its people,</p>
          <p>it is a world that grants each child a free home, and all the money they will ever require.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In a normal worlds, standardized education is seen as cruel and primitive,</p>
          <p>and people learn mostly on their own, but also through a personalized curriculum.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In a real school, there are no teachers,</p>
          <p>but tutors that never fail to help a curious student find all the answers they need.</p>
