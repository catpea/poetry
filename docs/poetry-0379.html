        <div class="section">
          <p>So everything you memorized,</p>
          <p>goes straight out the window.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You will be thrown against questions without answers,</p>
          <p>and judged based on the methods you use to eventually fail.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is the quality of your thinking,</p>
          <p>not the solution of the problem that gets you the position.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Supply and demand, money...</p>
          <p>you&apos;ve been made to memorize answers to trick puzzles since high school.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The entrance exams,</p>
          <p>are little more than crossword puzzles.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And the whole educational experience between middle school and university, inclusive,</p>
          <p>is about people making money off of you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>For the same reason why military does not recruit middle aged men,</p>
          <p>why the only go after the ones that didn&apos;t have a chance to become wise yet.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Businesses grow in places where there is money,</p>
          <p>and there is money in selling promises of futures.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And this is not a secret,</p>
          <p>especially when it comes to real jobs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Not jobs that will train you,</p>
          <p>but ones that expect you to lead as an innovator.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>So the interview process, is not about how many solutions to entrance exam puzzles you memorized,</p>
          <p>but about the puzzles that do not come with solutions, at all.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I know what you are thinking,</p>
          <p>you are not smart enough to lead, and try to solve those problems.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You had a tough time inn school,</p>
          <p>and nobody knows the you worked twice as hard.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This isn&apos;t about the school at all,</p>
          <p>the school is a theater that puts on a play.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The play sustains it self,</p>
          <p>it propagates it self, it is self referential, it exist for its own sake.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The twice as hard is there for everyone,</p>
          <p>it is there to convince you that it is worth the while.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But, it is not, worth the while,</p>
          <p>it is not worth the diploma anymore.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Look at med school,</p>
          <p>it is just a few more tests, AND THEN A DECADE OF PRACTICE.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This right here should tell you,</p>
          <p>how useful you school is.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Hence questions without answers,</p>
          <p>questions that test your ability to think outside of the box.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Questions that have nothing to do with formulas or facts you memorized,</p>
          <p>and have everything to do with things you have never encountered before.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In deed that you paid for an education,</p>
          <p>that you would have gained on your own had you been more responsible is a huge red minus.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You got yourself tricked,</p>
          <p>and now you don&apos;t even know the job is after the best decades of your life, and whatever is best in your mind.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The interview will be testing the greatness of your being,</p>
          <p>all the fields outside of the position you seek.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>They will expect to see a demonstration of the breadth of your knowledge,</p>
          <p>by watching you apply solutions from other fields by a simple and subtle analogy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Mind you,</p>
          <p>schools only taught you a single path.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Only one question out of the multiple was correct.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And here it is even more complex,</p>
          <p>because there is no answer.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This is a question of scanning for a solution,</p>
          <p>that does not exist.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The reason why you are being asked questions without answers,</p>
          <p>is to reveal the number and quality of attempts at the solution before you realize or are told that there is no answer.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is the quality intricacy and complexity of the search for the solution,</p>
          <p>that is being evaluated.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But there is friction here,</p>
          <p>because a real interview that does not actually insult you, approaches your soul all too close.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>All your genius, even if schools tricked you into believing you don&apos;t have it,</p>
          <p>and all the while asking you to trust them they will be there for you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>That they will be there when you are thirty and build not just a house but a home,</p>
          <p>they will be there when you are forty and try to live a healthier and more balanced life,</p>
          <p>they will be there when you are fifty, and sixty, and maybe seventy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In their inexperience they are challenging your soul, and your greatness,</p>
          <p>and asking you to give it to them.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The best interview tip I have for you,</p>
          <p>is to go there to question them instead.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Ask them how much of you do they expect you to give,</p>
          <p>and how much is your pay in proportion to the CEO.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And how long do they expect yo to work there,</p>
          <p>and how much do they think years of your life are really worth.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I recommend you ask that same question,</p>
          <p>at every interview...</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>and learn to no end,</p>
          <p>how your job is not that different from the minimal almost fake education that took your savings.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The answer to the original question that brought you here,</p>
          <p>was not College and Career.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It was Self Education,</p>
          <p>and Entrepreneurship.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You took the road more traveled,</p>
          <p>the first stretch took your money, and the second will take your decades so you can pay off the debt.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And you better have huge debt,</p>
          <p>because if you don&apos;t, then you don&apos;t even have a reason to go in to the interview.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Either way,</p>
          <p>this is not the way.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Every year of your life,</p>
          <p>is infinitely more valuable, than anything you will find, working for somebody else.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>So stop it,</p>
          <p>stop now before it is too late.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You are meant to learn for real,</p>
          <p>you are mean to be truly knowledgeable, far beyond anything that can be asked at an interview.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>No matter their zest for genius,</p>
          <p>they wouldn&apos;t come up with a question to capture one, their very position and approach is proof they wouldn&apos;t know what one looks like.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>As you can no doubt tell,</p>
          <p>a lot behind those questions is there so that they can impress themselves.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But enough about that stupid interview,</p>
          <p>that is not the way, that is not your way.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You have been misled by education and the promise of a safe job,</p>
          <p>today all of this still just about moneymaking.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You have been spread thin,</p>
          <p>you must pull yourself back together.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You have to go back and restore the predispositions that schools stripped yo off,</p>
          <p>in their haste to sell your mind for a paycheck, and later for your tuition.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Your unique predispositions are the only key to your future,</p>
          <p>you may think to yourself that you only had one, and it was ridiculously child like.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Yes, that is what a predisposition for greatness emerges as initially,</p>
          <p>a childhood curiosity.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And then as you tend to it it will fork and grow like a large corona,</p>
          <p>you will enter stages of Art and Music, Uniqueness and Creativity, you will zoom right past being a Genius and a Polymath, and learn things worth a thousand times more.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>So many things, that those asking those interview questions will look infantile,</p>
          <p>it will feel like a bunch of actors trying to make themselves look bigger either by caring to much r pretending to care too little.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Enough is enough,</p>
          <p>and no, it won&apos;t work temporary.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You need those years to grow,</p>
          <p>not to rent them out to bigger than thou ding-dongs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Finally, I am canceling your interview tomorrow,</p>
          <p>because it is a waste of your time.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Instead you are going shopping to prepare for an expedition,</p>
          <p>find the longest Adventure Trail wherever you live, Appalachian, Pacific Crest, whatever, and pack.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Get a Journal and a waterproof marker,</p>
          <p>and discover the polymath in you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>When you return,</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoqgAy3h4OM">build a series of small companies until you learn how to do it right</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And never again follow,</p>
          <p>and never again let someone tell you who you are, or smart you are, or where you need to be, or how much you are worth to them.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Be mindful of your legacy,</p>
          <p>and of those who are being misguided right now, help them learn, prevent them from making the same mistakes you did.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The world stands still, today, the politics are frozen, even the police kills those who they are sworn to protect,</p>
          <p>the World can only grow when you and countless others unleash the Genius, the Polymath, and the Greatness, within.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="section">
          <p>No interview,</p>
          <p>you are meant to become a great being.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The World needs you to lead,</p>
          <p>no more dumb interviews there isn&apos;t a company noble enough, there isn&apos;t a company worthy of your time.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This is not the kind of a world,</p>
          <p>each generation must progress forward, what you see before you is not fixed, it is just an imperfect stepping stone froward.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Stop letting others search for you,</p>
          <p>and set of on an endless adventure to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPSvdKTEZug">discover the great being within</a>.</p>
