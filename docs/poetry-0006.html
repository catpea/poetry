        <div class="section">
          <p>It is not the critic who counts;</p>
          <p>not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles,</p>
          <p>or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.</p>
          <p>The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena,</p>
          <p>whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood;</p>
          <p>who strives valiantly; who errs,</p>
          <p>who comes short again and again,</p>
          <p>because there is no effort without error and shortcoming;</p>
          <p>but who does actually strive to do the deeds;</p>
          <p>who knows great enthusiasms,</p>
          <p>the great devotions;</p>
          <p>who spends himself in a worthy cause;</p>
          <p>who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement,</p>
          <p>and who at the worst,</p>
          <p>if he fails,</p>
          <p>at least fails while daring greatly,</p>
          <p>so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.</p>
