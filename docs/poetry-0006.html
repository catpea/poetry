          <p>Day Six of Quarantine: Created a New Autogenerative Music Widget and disguised it as an immature <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/sciurine">Sciurine</a> Urine joke. The technology is extremely advanced. I am for the first time in forever connecting virtual synthesizers through a <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/docs/13.8.25/Reverb">Reverb Convolver</a>. This reshapes the Synthesized Sounds, the synthesizer waveform, into a more realistic sounding instrument. Reverb just about does it, if Commodore 64 came with a decent reverb it would sound amazing, nothing like chiptunes. I have gotten used to breaking up my Generative Music into movements, and the initial song comes with 24 measures, where evey eight measures I do something interesting with the higher pitched instruments. For the most part I fell like using A Basic <a href="https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js/wiki/Arpeggiator">Arpeggiator</a> for everything, I am yet to test it with real world sound samples (digital sound recordings as opposed to synthesizer based sounds.)</p>
