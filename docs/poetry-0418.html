          <p>Learning is like climbing a mountain,</p>
          <p>there are no shortcuts, and you have to go step by step.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And it is also like putting a computer together,</p>
          <p>or wiring a home entertainment center, you can&apos;t leave something out.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is also like learning just a little bit about ice skating,</p>
          <p>you really need to carefully step on that ice and see what it feels like.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Learning for real, is the same as having fun,</p>
          <p>being fascinated about what you are doing, enjoying it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Finally, learning for real is also about long term achievement,</p>
          <p>like section hiking the Appalachian Trail over many decades...</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>...and then arriving at Mount Katahdin, come your golden age;</p>
          <p>it is about making a difference, and becoming better for it, adding to greater whole.</p>

          <p>When we go to school, and we end up thinking,</p>
          <p>if I jump through these hoops I will graduate and then I&apos;ll figure the next step.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The strong sequence, the integrated whole, becomes a wet rag,</p>
          <p>the aim becomes a carrot on a stick, things become unclear, but we keep going.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is OK to make this mistake,</p>
          <p>so as long as we learn from it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>So as long as we learn,</p>
          <p>and prevent others from being taken advantage of the same way.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Begin asking questions about education,</p>
          <p>don&apos;t just sit there memorizing disconnected facts, demand a real education.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We all have computers now,</p>
          <p>we should all learn about programming.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We need to know that a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8ap4k_1QEQ">function</a> takes an input,</p>
          <p>transforms it, often by calling other functions, and return an output, output = function(input);</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We need to know what a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9wW2PpJsmQ">loop</a> is,</p>
          <p>that it often processes a list of items, one at a time, calling functions with the item as input.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>For example, for every user in a list,</p>
          <p>if membership expires soon on this user, then send warning message for this user.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Programming, is so simple,</p>
          <p>that it only takes a few days to learn.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You have to do it right,</p>
          <p>that is what schools were meant to help us with.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>For example, YOU NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER, start by just creating a file,</p>
          <p>and then configuring things, NO, you start with a <a href="https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start">boilerplate</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Only later, when you have time to waste,</p>
          <p>you go and read the darn <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start">manual or guide</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I am actually serious about this,</p>
          <p>the manual will never tell you what the most important parts are relative to your use case.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If you just need a window with a blank canvas,</p>
          <p>for a little 50 line wiki that helps you study, you don&apos;t need to worry about drop downs, or icon sizes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You will return many times to the things that are useful,</p>
          <p>and with each use case, you will learn a new way of using the program, that is far more than any documentation can explain.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Another huge deal, is the language you start with,</p>
          <p>I know many programming languages but I don&apos;t use them, some are too old, but in most cases they just do things badly and are too small.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The language you choose must be the one getting the most stress, attention, and hate,</p>
          <p>because to hate a language is to admit to have learned the wrong one.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Today that language is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VYpMxA4Q1k">ES2021</a>,</p>
          <p>it is the evolution of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afSbBjAaqeM">JavaScript</a>, the language behind all the web applications, that also runs on the server via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVwtVBpw7RQ">node.js</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>There are some strong side languages that are worth considering venturing into,</p>
          <p>but just bookmark them and forget it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You need to learn language that will help you create cute little command line programs, mighty web apps,</p>
          <p>quick and dirty web servers that never complain under real stress, and desktop applications, including powerful code editors.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Above all, it all needs to be cross platform,</p>
          <p>so that you never have to worry about rewriting your program for a different operating system.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>To learn something, we need really competent teachers,</p>
          <p>who learned what they know not from textbooks, but from experience.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If it is not possible to have good teachers,</p>
          <p>then it is more important to lean on your own first, and then go to school to get the diploma.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If the school isn&apos;t teaching then you are not going to learn anything,</p>
          <p>you are only going to learn something that isn&apos;t even all that useful.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In closing, I would like to share with you, the most ridiculous and tiny little programming thing I have ever learned,</p>
          <p>this is from a manual of a program unlikely to be taught in any school, the program is called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlqv9Np3iAU">CouchDB</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is just a little tidbit,</p>
          <p>that jumped out at me, and I&apos;ve been using it like clay in my own code experiments.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>When working on the web not only do you have multiple people saving data at the same time,</p>
          <p>but also multiple instances of your program handling the traffic, usually one per CPU core.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>People normally just use a database a program that is far and away,</p>
          <p>and is designed to handle multiple connections.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But to me that adds extra complexity,</p>
          <p>I once had MySQL database go down for no reason at all, the server was offline, perfectly configured, indexed with quality SQL, and there was nothing in the logs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>At that point I was doing simple data gathering for a prestigious institution,</p>
          <p>and the reason I used a proper database, is to avoid things getting broken like this without explanation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In that moment I promised myself to play with files a little bit more,</p>
          <p>I wanted to find a way to save a file under the stress of multiple simultaneous connections.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Years later reading up on CouchDB, the way they stored their records,</p>
          <p>made me jump, it was both suspicions and lovely.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I invented my own tiny theory about it,</p>
          <p>a demand that no matter what happens, information must always be stored on disk, and as soon as it is possible.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If you have many users trying to update some common piece of information,</p>
          <p>such as the profile of a school, the chances of one overriding the other are very high.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Inspired by Couch, I create a directory, named after the file I want to save,</p>
          <p>and then as people try to save that file, I store their information in a randomly named file inside the directory.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The first and foremost, is that all data, from all users and processes is saved,</p>
          <p>it can never be lost, every file that I save in that directory has a long random file name that is guaranteed to be unique.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Even if Alice and Bob, save Manhattan International High School Profile at the same time,</p>
          <p>the server records their information in two different files, no data is lost.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The filenames also contain version numbers, it is possible to track conflicts,</p>
          <p>the system can now flag when two people saved at the same time.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But more than that, the really cool part is that many servers storing files this way,</p>
          <p>can synchronize together, as the files are always uniquely named, so thousand servers can keep in sync tracking all changes, marking wherever there are edit conflicts.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>People saving data can see conflicts,</p>
          <p>and resolve them as they make their updates.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I don&apos;t want to write too much about the details of this program,</p>
          <p>but a conflict occurs when both Alice and Bob edit version 10 of the Manhattan International High School Profile, hit save at the same time, and call it a day.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>That means that two versions 11 exist, no data is lost, but the person in charge of school profiles will see a red flag,</p>
          <p>and may investigate, and mark one of the files as deleted.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Another notable thing is that if nobody cares to resolve the conflict,</p>
          <p>there is this crazy way of deciding which version 11 is going to be used.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You know how those files are randomly named,</p>
          <p>the conflicting files are sorted alphanumerically and the first one wins.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is an arbitrary election mechanism,</p>
          <p>but no matter the circumstance, CPU core, user, or server, it is an arbitrary but consistent election process, that always returns the same winner.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>What I describe here,</p>
          <p>is saving a file.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I have a feeling that only practicing and learning on your own,</p>
          <p>will make you sensitive, or maybe even passionate about such little gems.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Even if this ever made it to a test,</p>
          <p>how is marking that correctly on a multiple choice exam, or even even making a fake little homework program going to emphasize this as special.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And before any pro complains about using this in production,</p>
          <p>this is a useful data backup mechanism, that should be used along side a proper database.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Learning for real is an adventure,</p>
          <p>you make fascinating discoveries in your travel.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is better to learn on your own and then go to school to graduate,</p>
          <p>if you still wan to.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Learning for real will also make you happy,</p>
          <p>I enjoy experimenting with different variations of the CouchDB inspired file saving mechanism.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Visualizing data being saved without any obstruction, if statement or error,</p>
          <p>sure makes for a fun programming session.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In school we get stressed out about passing the exams,</p>
          <p>or trying to graduate in half the time to save money, and that is no way to learn.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>That is not how a Student should be treated,</p>
          <p>a Student represents the future of humanity, they should be treated with great dignity and respect.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I think time has come to view schools that charge for education, and companies that require a diploma,</p>
          <p>as institutions that have little talent, will eventually either lose credibility, or just go out of business.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>What does a company that demands a diploma say,</p>
          <p>about its stability and your retirement plan, what does it say about the talent that you will encounter there.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Will your co-workers be passionate about making cute little file saving discoveries,</p>
          <p>or is it all going to be about profit maximization and promotions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Once you retire,</p>
          <p>the real work starts.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You now enter an age where you are experienced enough to make lasting contributions,</p>
          <p>to leave an inspired and meaningful legacy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And at this stage in your life,</p>
          <p>having learned for real, becomes even more important, as you rely on it, to become a Great Being.</p>
