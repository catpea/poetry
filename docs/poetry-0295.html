          <p>Knowledge has an enormous impact on decision making,</p>
          <p>if you don&apos;t know enough you maybe taken advantage of.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>You gain knowledge by means of authentic education,</p>
          <p>an education that has maximum impact on your existence.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Memorization or cramming is not an authentic education,</p>
          <p>it is not any kind of education.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>You don&apos;t want to rely on a doctor that memorized everything in school,</p>
          <p>professionals must look things up to keep up with changes.</p>

        <section>
          <p>Memorization is only good for two things,</p>
          <p>passing tests, and getting you ready for a factory job on an assembly line.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And on the other end, tests are for teachers to keep their jobs,</p>
          <p>and principals to keep getting funding.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>You have to make sure that you are not getting sold for a money,</p>
          <p>that you are not being used to sustain an outdated industry.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And above all, do not let them trick you into thinking yo are not smart,</p>
          <p>we are all extremely smart, we are all, without exception extremely good at learning for real.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>The problem is with schools, they are trying to use a single teacher,</p>
          <p>to teach anywhere between 30 and 300 students.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>There is no way that a teacher can handle that,</p>
          <p>so they will make up tests so that majority passes and damn the rest.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Memorization is just a temporary circus trick,</p>
          <p>make sure you are learning meaningful things that have lasting impact.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Real education will multiply you,</p>
          <p>fake education will make a fool out of you.</p>

        <section>
          <p>Decision-making is one of the most important things in life,</p>
          <p>we need Real Education, Real Knowledge to help us make correct decisions in life.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Many of the decisions we make early on,</p>
          <p>have long term impact that continues for decades in not for life.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>It also matters that we grow up in an authentic culture,</p>
          <p>if we are surrounded by lairs that too will contribute to push us off the path we want to be on.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>You must ask if perhaps the school industry is using outdated teaching methods</p>
          <p>that barely worked during industrial revolution, to keep getting government money.</p>

        <section>
          <p>Every student in every country,</p>
          <p>from middle school to university must to check if they are really learning for real.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Real education is one that enriches a person with Knowledge gained in previous generations,</p>
          <p>real education provides many lifetimes of knowledge in a beautifully arranged bouquet.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>In turn, that Knowledge grows in you as its components become your own building blocks,</p>
          <p>and help you to become Strong, Happy, Wise, Beautiful,</p>
          <p>and eventually help you become a Great Being, one who makes lasting contributions to Human Kind.</p>
