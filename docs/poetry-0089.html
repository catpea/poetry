          <p>Your superpowers are not rooted in your wishes,</p>
          <p>as only very few wishes come true.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>Universe has already established its rule and order,</p>
          <p>we are latecomers to the Symphony Orchestra.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>Instead, seek your superpowers in what you already own,</p>
          <p>in the things that have already sprung.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>In the incredible adaptability of your body,</p>
          <p>in your raw, unleashed consciousness.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>If you are good to your body, you body will flourish,</p>
          <p>it is a biological system, not that different from a flower.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If you are good to your mind, it will expand,</p>
          <p>it is a navigational system with landmarks.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>Your mind is especially beautiful,</p>
          <p>it has a large memory capacity.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>You can&apos;t recall letters on a particular page in a book,</p>
          <p>but you can recall the walls in your home, the streets in your city.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>Your mind does not differentiate between navigating a road,</p>
          <p>or a vast galaxy of star constellations.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Your mind can encode interconnected knowledge,</p>
          <p>so as long as it is marked with pictures and relative locations on a well connected tree.</p>

          <p>It is foolish to think to a particular page,</p>
          <p>and feel ordinary for not being able to recall all the words.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is foolish to try to ride a boat,</p>

          <p>Do not seek to invent your superpowers,</p>
          <p>instead, recognize the ones you already have - and expand them.</p>
