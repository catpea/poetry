          <p>Jogging is a wise teacher,</p>
          <p>it teaches bodybuilding.</p>
        </section>

          <p>that our bodies are powerful.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>But, they do not adapt as quickly,</p>
          <p>as our fancies strike us.</p>
        </section>

          <p>There is one fantastic way to jog,</p>
          <p>measure how long you can run.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And how long you need to rest,</p>
          <p>to run that long again.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Make the jogging number (1 minute)</p>
          <p>and the rest number (2 minutes)</p>
          <p>your friends for the Spring.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Rest 5 times, jog four,</p>
          <p>don&apos;t be too hard on yourself.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Jogging is difficult,</p>
          <p>because you should dance first.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Dancing and walking,</p>
          <p>are lovely at making you a Jogger.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>But if you are in a hurry,</p>

        </section>

        <section>
          <p>So, rest, jog, rest jog, rest jog,</p>
          <p>rest jog, and rest.</p>

          <p>but you have to run each day.</p>

          <p>as it is three times longer than your jog.</p>
        </section>

        <section>

          <p>because, you are beautiful to me.</p>

          <p>to make a new kind of fruit for health nuts.</p>
        </section>
