          <p>Dear Parents,</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>School past elementary may not be working,</p>
          <p>you should let your children know it is broken.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Tell them, it is still a big deal for you,</p>
          <p>because as babysitters go, school is the best.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>But be warned, if your child is getting bad grades,</p>
          <p>then that means the school has picked you child for a stupid little <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzSnvxejenY">sacrifice</a>.</p>
        </section>

        <section>

        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Let me explain why this is happening,</p>
          <p>if school really was a babysitter...</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Then your children would be safe,</p>
          <p>but it is an institution under pressure to show results or lose accreditation.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>If your child stops memorizing and starts messing with their statistics,</p>
          <p>they will be seen as a problem, an anomaly.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>They many become part of the small percentage of failures,</p>
          <p>or they may be tagged with Attention Deficit, or a Bipolar Disorder, where they will be given dangerous, by incompetent doctors, to encourage memorization.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>To use Sir Ken Robinson&apos;s example,</p>
          <p>they will be given dangerous drugs, the way people used to have their tonsils removed.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <hr>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Scientists make mistakes, corporations make money,</p>
          <p>we cannot rule our a fictitious epidemic, the world is too complex to get clear answers.</p>
        </section>

        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=sir+ken+robinson&amp;sp=CAM%253D">Sir Ken Robinson</a> was too wise,
        <p>too loving, too experienced for us to ignore his work.</p>

        <section>
          <p>All we need to do, is ask,</p>
          <p>are we OK with schools being little more than good babysitters?</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Do we want the students to become great beings,</p>
          <p>or great employees?</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And we need to ask,</p>
          <p>if the schools had worked for us.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <hr>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And if the answer is that schools are not working,</p>
          <p>then let us become more authentic on this subject.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Let us stop celebrating fake graduations,</p>
          <p>let us stop caring about fake grades and worthless diplomas.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And let us all understand that a school education,</p>
          <p>is a fake education, a failed education, the absolute minimum that does almost nothing.</p>

        <section>
          <p>Everything around your child will conspire</p>
          <p>to make them think that their grade point average, is a measure of their intelligence.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>The grades given out by teachers that tweak their tests to stay under the radar and keep their job,</p>
          <p>are only representative of the teacher&apos;s fraud, and the fraudulent nature of the school it self.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>If your child has tricked themselves into thinking they are not smart,</p>
          <p>then that means school isn&apos;t the only thing that is failing them.</p>
        </section>

        <section>

        </section>

        <section>
          <p>If they ever mentioned a bully,</p>
          <p>let them know right now, that they can listen to audio books, and don&apos;t need to go back to school anymore.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Help them find SAT tutors that can explain everything,</p>
          <p>and not just expect them to memorize garbage.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Genius, is nothing more than a matter of practice of knowledge,</p>
          <p>the way athletes practice their sports, and magicians practice their tricks.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Do not let your children think that they are not intelligent,</p>
          <p>or that there is something wrong with them because they can&apos;t brainlessly memorize disconnected facts.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Let them learn for real,</p>
          <p>help them become Entrepreneurs and a Founders.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>The school industry is an outdated industry, it stands today as a monument to greed,</p>
          <p>and only because too many people rely on it for a small paycheck.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Above all know this; there is no greater crime in the universe,</p>
          <p>then a parent standing idly by as their child is slowly convinced they are not smart enough, to become a Great Being.</p>

        <section>
          <p>The school library are all the Audio Books,</p>
          <p>that move you, listen to each one many times over.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>May the nature, and the starts, and the trail,</p>
          <p>help you inherit all the world&apos;s wisdom.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>You are to fill yourself with knowledge,</p>
          <p>until you become wise.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And you will know the day of your graduation</p>
          <p>out of your own hard earned wisdom.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>May you carry on forward,</p>
          <p>to become a Great Being and Great Inspiration.</p>
