        <div class="section">
          <p>It depends where you start,</p>
          <p>start someplace easy and neat.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Modern web is a mix of several technologies</p>
          <p>and each _can_ be overwhelming, not to mention all together.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But the web is tough for all,</p>
          <p>even hardcore programmers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>As a programmer, you don&apos;t actually have to know a programming language,</p>
          <p>managing the creation of a program, is far more powerful than writing it yourself.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Programming on the web is a lot of trouble,</p>
          <p>you probably don&apos;t want to rely on any company providing specific services.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>With the exception of the operating system you pick,</p>
          <p>and the hosting company that is good-enough for now.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And even with that, you already committed to owning a web server,</p>
          <p>the moment your server goes online, there will be automated tools scanning it for exploits, and trying to guess the password.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The computers trying to break into your server, by the way,</p>
          <p>are hacked, they are the ones that the automated hacking programs already broke into.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Any other traffic will be coming from Tor or vpn networks,</p>
          <p>often times the location of the hacked server is obscured.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>There is nothing you can do,</p>
          <p>nobody cares that their server is hacked.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The moment one gets shut down,</p>
          <p>couple more will get hacked elsewhere,</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Unless you want to run a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WUaI2pNiPI">honeypot</a> tracking those servers,</p>
          <p>you probably don&apos;t want to program web applications unless it is something big.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But notice how phone apps use the Phone CPU,</p>
          <p>and it is the worst CPU to use, it is slow, battery powered, and you need it for emergencies, and for answering the phone.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>At the same time, if there was one large company trying to keep up with the processing power needed to make all the apps go,</p>
          <p>they would need a large and complex operation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Apps, that you pay for, burn up your own CPU and battery power,</p>
          <p>they are not web applications, they are resilient, decoupled, distributed.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>They are clearly a success,</p>
          <p>they make the phone more useful.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But as far as complex Graphic User Interface applications go,</p>
          <p>I say, put them on the desktop.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Even with the crazy restrictions that popular Desktop Operating Systems created,</p>
          <p>the walled gardens, non-free developer networks a Desktop is still a good target.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>For one, when you create a desktop application,</p>
          <p>it is not going to be instantly attacked by hacked computers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And if it is a good idea, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FquNpWdf9vg">HyperCard</a> was,</p>
          <p>you can sell it f9or a good price.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>When developing for the Desktop should use a base like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YP_nOCO-4Q">electron</a>,</p>
          <p>or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UsGnjPYxLU">NW.js</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The big weakness of desktops,</p>
          <p>is that there are three incompatible operating systems, electron and NW.js, are actually cross platform and repair that problem.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You don&apos;t have to start Developing your application User Interface First,</p>
          <p>learning programming relies on good ideas, not just what is possible, but also, what is good.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>For example <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLPiMl8XUKU">Smalltalk</a> has a very consistent user interface that requires very little GUI programming,</p>
          <p>it is a good idea to write the non-GUI core of your program first, at the very least, to make it easily testable.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If you do like complex architecture, a well thought out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-HGdc8L-7w">Object Oriented Programming</a> language can be useful,</p>
          <p>even better if you use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuWEQsE7Hlo">Behavior Driven Development</a> that describes your program core in a readable subset of English.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You shouldn&apos;t let programming become complicated, though,</p>
          <p>look at Apple&apos;s Siri, it is just chat; or filling out forms one line at a time.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Siri combined with a program like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzvqSVgc2t4">MUD</a>,</p>
          <p>can start keeping track of context of conversations and learn and become more intelligent.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Finally, I think the best type of a program is one that has two kind of users,</p>
          <p>the end-user that enhance their program by making additional purchases, and plugin-creators that further expand your original program idea.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This isn&apos;t so much about creating something as toxic as in-game-purchases,</p>
          <p>but rather developing the initial features of your program as if you were a third-party content creator.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Giving your program life from inside out,</p>
          <p>all the way back from its most fundamental features.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This way you can upgrade your program, one board at a time,</p>
          <p>like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVlIZJTwgyQ">Ship of Theseus</a>.</p>
