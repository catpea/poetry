          <p>Might is meant for battle only,</p>
          <p>when battles end, we must return to balance.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Life is meant to revolve around cheerfulness,</p>
          <p>or sweet mischief if you are one of those.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>It is fueled by knowledge,</p>
          <p>driven by wisdom, all towards greatness.</p>

          <p>It matters that we are good to ourselves,</p>
          <p>that we care about our body and mind.</p>

        <section>
          <p>Some battles such as World Peace,</p>
          <p>can&apos;t yet be fought, and we must not try.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>If something is too big,</p>
          <p>then it will take our cheerfulness and life away.</p>

          <p>There is much in the world that needs repair,</p>
          <p>but first the world must become wiser.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Before a battle for World Peace is fought,</p>
          <p>we must repair schools.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And before we take to repairing schools,</p>
          <p>we must first speak out about what is wrong with them.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>The wiser our approach to such great endeavors,</p>
          <p>the more you will see that it calls for clear thinking.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And clear thinking cannot come,</p>
          <p>out of an unbalanced mind.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>It requires peace, and cheerfulness, the sun and the moon,</p>
          <p>ocean sunshine, snowy adventures, and fragrant woods.</p>

          <p>the book need not be long but it must be fascinating.</p>

        <section>
          <p>Your health and the way you treat yourself in life,</p>
          <p>must be the first and foremost concern.</p>
