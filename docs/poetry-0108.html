          <p>Every one in a while I bicycle to the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/J7BhcUqsPx1wNJEBA">south end</a>,</p>
          <p>and check if they did any work, and how it went.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I always find it old, and full, of bumps thorns and grass,</p>
          <p>no matter how hard I bicycle, there is never a way to pass.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I work up this morning, and said &quot;It is time for another check!&quot;,</p>
          <p>I got my gear together, and squirted sunblock all around on my neck.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And as soon as got too far to go back,</p>
          <p>my bicycle, creaked, and shuddered, and squeaked - and I was like &quot;What the heck?&quot;</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>The noise came from the bottom where the pedals are,</p>
          <p>and only the left pedal made noise thus far.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And the noise would not cease,</p>
          <p>I had the tools but no grease.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>So I said to my self in a deep tone &quot;It is time for Field Repair!,</p>
          <p>and although I have no grease, I will not despair.&quot;&quot;</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>First, I checked the pockets of my new red pants, the short ones that I like,</p>
          <p>but there was nothing there that could fix my bike.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>So I looked to my day pack, and the solution sat right next to my bicycle lock,</p>
          <p>I squeaked! &quot;I do have grease, it is in my sun block!&quot;</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>So I squired some on the pedals and the connecting rod,</p>
          <p>and though I admit the solution was a bit odd...</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I was back on the road, riding smoothly and quietly like a pro,</p>
          <p>after all, I had places to go.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I made it to the southern edge, it was 15 miles away,</p>
          <p>they still didn&apos;t fix anything, bumps and shrubs were blocking the way.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I took a photo to share with you,</p>
          <p>just in case you were thinking about going or pushing through.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>The <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/oRaowTwL1cdz5G549">actual ancient end of the trail</a> is not that far away,</p>
          <p>about 2.6 miles south, but you are better off walking the rest of the way.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Even better than following the ancient end, is to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/j93A21irtxaaRzd96">go to the park</a>,</p>
          <p>and head for lake Erie, but make sure to leave early, so that you don&apos;t bicycle back after dark.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>The trick to make it to the lake is to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/yDvAJg3dUWX2atPY9">turn right before</a> the Nature Center,</p>
          <p>and head through Flat Rock, to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Uq1DXX5HRwXxYtcW7">Maple Beach</a>, you don&apos;t have to pay to enter.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I think of it as the real end to the trail,</p>
          <p>reaching it always make for a good tale.</p>
