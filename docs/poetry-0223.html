        <section>
          <p>They were students, researching, thinking, learning,</p>
          <p>they were not renowned scientists, they were just bored programmers looking for a challenge.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Something greater than mathematics, or algorithms, or languages,</p>
          <p>they were looking for something more than any of their computers could simulate.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <hr>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>So they started programming,</p>
          <p>programming a class of machines that could repair and rebuild themselves.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Really basic stuff, the machines would rely on,</p>
          <p>whatever they could absorb from their environment.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>They needed to survive indefinitely,</p>
          <p>machines that could make machines, and repair, and renew.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <hr>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>A few milestones down the road,</p>
          <p>they started thinking about practical applications.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>They created tiny capsules that could be launched into already accelerated asteroids,</p>
          <p>and even though the capsules were tiny, they had the ability to make countless copies,</p>
          <p>and build bacterial colonies large enough to Terraform distant exo-planets.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <hr>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Upon reaching a nearby stars,</p>
          <p>capsules would disperse from forces of gravity and solar radiation.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Eventually land on the nearby exo-planets,</p>
          <p>and begin executing their adaptation routine and create copies uniquely bound to the local chemistry.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>The programmers setup a simple sequence of steps that would either induce early death,</p>
          <p>or later reproduction, with pushing the more adapted information onto the offspring.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <hr>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>All because, there was nothing they could do to create something that would outlast time,</p>
          <p>everything decays, we are all bombarded with radiation, protons and muons, and asteroids.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>To create something lasting,</p>
          <p>it would have to renew it self, rebuild adapt.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>It would have to self assemble into colonies or microbiomes,</p>
          <p>destroy the problematic, and promote the more adapted.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And spread, and grow, and continue adapting,</p>
          <p>the DNA system was noisy enough to allow all kinds of variation.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>There was nothing else that could work,</p>
          <p>only cellular machinery could adapt without radio, soldering irons, without a forge, without tools,</p>
          <p>without a source of heat even, without hands, or brains.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <hr>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Getting the propulsion systems to work was just as amazing,</p>
          <p>anything that whizzed by from small meteors to comets and large asteroids was infused with the capsules.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>They even used lasers to accelerate some of the capsules to relativistic speeds,</p>
          <p>the cells stored inside the capsules barely noticed any passage of time at all.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <hr>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Eventually, everything that could sustain DNA based life,</p>
          <p>was filled to the brim with it.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Comets, meteors, asteroids would further spread the little machines,</p>
          <p>galaxies became cross-contaminated multiple times.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Life is everywhere,</p>
          <p>and everywhen.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>The Virgo Cluster did not receive the original genetic material,</p>
          <p>we have evolved across countless solar systems and many galaxies.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <hr>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>The capsules contained a lot more than generic programming,</p>
          <p>they contained instructions on how to establish an interface with it, and maintain it.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And they contained instructions,</p>
          <p>on getting back Home, to Methuselah Prime.</p>
