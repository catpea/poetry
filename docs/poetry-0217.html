          <p>By the time you realize how true it is that the world is yours,</p>
          <p>all the authority figures you once knew, will have retired.</p>

        <section>
          <p>So in teenage days, just as teachers are brainlessly trying to convince everyone,</p>
          <p>that we are not good enough because we don&apos;t listen, or because we are failing their questionable curriculum.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>We actually need to take a step back,</p>
          <p>and find a way to learn for real.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Because even if, we don&apos;t waste, a single day,</p>
          <p>real life will do a pretty good job at overwhelming us anyway.</p>

          <p>You need to be learning hard,</p>
          <p>with your friends.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>You need to be learning,</p>
          <p>from Lectures, Documentaries, Audio Books, Maker Shops and Hacker Spaces.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>You need to be learning how to build real businesses,</p>
          <p>that have a long lasting impact on your community, and maybe the world.</p>

          <p>For those of us who aren&apos;t going into cozy Science or Medicine,</p>
          <p>we need to come out of High School fists up, fighting, and swinging and kicking.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Because it is not college that should follow High School,</p>
          <p>college is something you do for entertainment.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Taking late classes to unwind,</p>
          <p>and sharpen your memorization and concept mapping skills.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>After High School, you need to put an A-Team together, bitchy parents includes,</p>
          <p>and cross the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPSvdKTEZug">Appalachian Trail</a>, and keep in mind, that you may become a regular hiker.</p>

        <section>
          <p>After High School,</p>
          <p>your first and only aim, is to find a reasonable path to Greatness.</p>

        <section>
          <p>Greatness... because everywhere else,</p>
          <p>somehow, unforgivably, may just lead right back to the start.</p>

          <p>You just don&apos;t know what it is going to be like when you return,</p>
          <p>but you will be part mountain goat, part wild person that comfortably sh*ts in the woods.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And what is more, my friends, you will know, that should life ever challenge you,</p>
          <p>you will be able to handle it, with Heart and Soul, with Wisdom, Humor and Grace.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>There is not a moment to waste, there is not a day to pass,</p>
          <p>make everyone of them count, and then help others to their own paths.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Remind your younger generation,</p>
          <p>that they are not to lead sleepy lives of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmtEiOs50u0">mild discontent</a>.</p>

          <p>You are the future, you are wisdom that the world needs to survive,</p>
          <p>you are the leaders that are all the Hopes and Dreams of the past generations,</p>
          <p>and your rightful stance in life, is that of a Great Being, and nothing less.</p>
