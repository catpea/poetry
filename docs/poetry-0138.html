          <p>Good to see you, my Enormous Old Friend,</p>
          <p>how long has it been now?</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>You haven&apos;t aged a day,</p>
          <p>and as promised I grew in Wisdom, and Strength, and I maybe a bit Taller.</p>

          <p>I bet they finally fixed that <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@40.7060248,-73.9967572,2a,75y,286.07h,64.46t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sGiVjQ4_lsY3jlLY0PM3KEA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en">achy bench</a> on the Manhattan side,</p>

          <p>The Bridge, Lady Liberty, and the Old Twins</p>
          <p>kept me company.</p>

          <p>We&apos;d sit calmly together,</p>

          <p>The New York County Supreme Court was my only other friend,</p>
          <p>and I still love her dearly, but we don&apos;t speak anymore.</p>

        <section>
          <p>I wanted to be a Judge,</p>
          <p>a Philosopher King as I used to think of them - but I think better now.</p>

        <section>
          <p>I think in my old age, I&apos;ll come to <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@40.714548,-74.0024396,3a,75y,102.05h,105.41t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1smigFc8sXfFR7X-Jni_7Ogg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?hl=en">her stairs</a>,</p>
          <p>and I will wear my suit,</p>
          <p>and I will wear those shoes that the lawyers went up and down the stairs in - back in 96.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I will read her words again,</p>
          <p>&quot;THE TRUE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IS THE FIRMEST PILLAR OF GOOD GOVERNMENT&quot;,</p>
          <p>But if she could speak, I&apos;d ask about Fair Starts, Prevention, and Rehabilitation, now.</p>

          <p>I made a little pilgrimage after the Twins Feel,</p>
          <p>I went to see if all was healing properly, and it was,</p>
          <p>workers were preparing the site for what would become the Freedom Tower.</p>

          <p>The city was unchanged,</p>

          <p>&quot;Home Sweet Home&quot; - I said out of awe and nostalgia</p>
          <p>as we turned to see the New York City Skyline framed in the bus window,</p>
          <p>&quot;Damn Right&quot; the person next to me muttered.</p>

          <p>That broken bench on the Manhattan side,</p>
          <p>was my bench, we connected instantly, I was breathless - it is a long walk.</p>

          <p>The things I&apos;d ponder about back then were supremely simple.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Like, &quot;When is it going to stop raining&quot;, and,</p>
          <p>&quot;Will they let me back on the Subway in a coat this wet?&quot;</p>

          <p>and I wanted to know more about what Ferris Bueller said;</p>
          <p>&quot;Life moves pretty fast. If you don&#x2019;t stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.&quot;</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>But it turned out, I&apos;d never let go of a year without trying to learn something new and lasting,</p>
          <p>years were always too precious for me, I&apos;d claw at Decembers like a cat going after his favorite toy.</p>

          <p>Mostly, I would sit there quietly,</p>
          <p>watch the occasional jogger.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Stare at the cars going left and right beneath me, and boats going up and down East River,</p>
          <p>I remember always having some sweets on me, the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@40.7060248,-73.9967572,2a,75y,286.07h,64.46t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sGiVjQ4_lsY3jlLY0PM3KEA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en">old bench</a> is a great place for a Picnic.</p>
