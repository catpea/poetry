          <p>Somehow, Wednesday turned out to be the tiniest day.</p>
          <p>I was quiet all day, slowly programming away.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I&apos;ve been thinking about my bicycle, birds, and rain,</p>
          <p>but mostly working on my new website domain.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>My bicycle trails have been calling me all week,</p>
          <p>I prepared my bicycle and am I ready, so to speak.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>There was much rain today,</p>
          <p>it will take a few more days, before I pedal away.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>It is not always about the adventure,</p>
          <p>I love how all the spring trees smell.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>How the birds sing in the morning,</p>
          <p>how the air is crisp and new.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I never set a plan as to how far I will ride,</p>
          <p>I just get on the bicycle and enjoy the outside.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Every once in a while I perch upon an overpass,</p>
          <p>scribble code, or just watch the cars sometimes.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>There are many memorable places along the way,</p>
          <p>they are all very tiny and hidden away.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Old graffiti, sculptures and parks, abandoned railway,</p>
          <p>I could talk about them all day.</p>
