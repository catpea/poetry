          <p>To rise, to become strong, to grow and to break away and become more authentic,</p>
          <p>is our first great responsibility, and our health.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>However, it does go against our nature as children,</p>
          <p>we have a tendency not to look outside of the culture we are brought into.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>Rite of Passage is about crossing that line,</p>
          <p>the line between The Child That Follows, and The Adult That Leads.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>The moment we can handle looking at ourselves and our culture,</p>
          <p>from the <strong>outside</strong> in, we begin crossing the line into adulthood.</p>

          <p>One of the first few thoughts may be, &quot;But what if I was born into a different religion?&quot;</p>
          <p>followed by, &quot;What if I was not born into this economic class, into this poverty?&quot;.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>As these questions grow from asking about ourselves, to also including others,</p>
          <p>they bring us insight into the greater Human Condition.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>Bring us to the question of The Freedom of Will, of how much our Personality is Our Own,</p>
          <p>of internal decision making heavily influenced by external culture or placement.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>As we grow we begin asking even greater questions about others,</p>
          <p>&quot;Would the petty thief stole, had he <strong>not</strong> been fractured by the virus of poverty?&quot;</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>Our minds begin scanning for solutions that aim towards a Greater Good,</p>
          <p>towards Word Peace, International Convergence on Wisdom, Unites States of The World.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>We begin seeing that although there isn&apos;t an answer to every question,</p>
          <p>there are Dreams that could prevent the worst of World&apos;s Mistakes.</p>

          <p>instead of forecasting war and manufacturing enough weapons.</p>

          <p>Preventing the existence of criminals,</p>

          <p>No matter which questions we begin with and how our path is arranged,</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>How much more we are,</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>How important to our mental health,</p>
          <p>it is not to fall a victim to bad ideas or fractures of poverty.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>Our First Great Act in life is lifting ourselves above the culture we are born into,</p>
          <p>that is the meaning of the words Rising, Growing Up, Breaking Away, Becoming Stronger.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Have no fear of Rising, of Breaking Away, of Growing Up, of Growing In Strength,</p>
          <p>for that is Adulthood, and none can stay children for long.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Close your eyes, and begin building,</p>
          <p>because your next step is to become a Great Being.</p>
