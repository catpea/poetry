          <p>To rise, to become strong, to grow and to break away and become more authentic,</p>
          <p>is our first great responsibility, and our health.</p>

        <section>
          <p>However, it does go against our nature as children,</p>
          <p>we have a tendency not to look outside of the culture we are brought into.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Rite of Passage is about crossing that line,</p>
          <p>the line between The Child That Follows, and The Adult That Leads.</p>

        <section>
          <p>The moment we can handle looking at ourselves and our culture,</p>

          <p>followed by, &quot;What if I was not born into this economic class, into this poverty?&quot;.</p>

        <section>
          <p>As these questions grow from asking about ourselves, to also including others,</p>

        <section>
          <p>As we grow we begin asking even greater questions about others,</p>

        <section>
