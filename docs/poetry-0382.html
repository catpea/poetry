        <div class="section">
          <p>I noticed the little road by I-275 a long time ago,</p>
          <p>back then it was still in disrepair, today it is all new.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The <a href="https://michigantrails.org/trails/275-metro-trail/">I-275 Trail</a></p>
          <p>connects to other trails.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="section">
          <p>Hines Drive is pretty neat and very safe,</p>
          <p>as you can ride on the sidewalk away from all the cars.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/eSeihX8HaSUKcjx56">Lower Huron Metropark</a> is pretty much an adventure in it self,</p>
          <p>there is even a <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/9TJC2gscE56NQTb78">campsite for tents, equipped with a safe place for a fire, private benches, a little parking spot, with a near by vending machine and restrooms</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>As neat as that is, there is another park, and it is big and very interesting,</p>
          <p><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/NyFcqndE7XbwcLdeA">The Willow Metropark</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It takes a while to explore it,</p>
          <p>you will need water and some trail mix, this is a proper expedition now.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/D4GtKbc73BuD75fA6">it connects to yet another park</a>, all free,</p>
          <p>it is called <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/8F8smKiLdFqTfp4b9">The Oakwoods Metropark</a>, and that one <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/29fwTWgm8ArbGLcn9">has a little nature preserve cabin you can munch your trail mix in</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>There is a <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/3BNSyheqeoxewxT6A">secret little passage here</a>,</p>
          <p>that takes you to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/XUvtwNiKvNC2imYy6">Downtown Flatrock</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>From Flatrock it is not super far to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Rwwds2o5vL8EeawJ6">a little lookout by Lake Erie</a>,</p>
          <p>this park is called <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/JQdSUDcsA8Leg8Hv8">The Lake Erie Metropark</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I had some trouble navigating through Flatrock to The Lake Erie Metropark,</p>
          <p>the trail was not marked, and I was just headed towards Lake Erie, I didn&apos;t know there was a fancy little metropark there.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If you set of early morning,</p>
          <p>you can make it in one day.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But it gets weird, when you are already tired,</p>
          <p>and you realize you are only half way through your journey.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It would be nice to spend some time on that little lookout,</p>
          <p>there are lots of fancy geese there in the summer.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>As an exploratory expedition,</p>
          <p>it is a perfect adventure.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But maybe staying at the tent site,</p>
          <p>and maybe a hotel in flat-rock could be pretty fun.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It would become a three or four day adventure,</p>
          <p>and there is nothing here that is too wiled or deprived, it is just fancy bicycle trails.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Another option is to have your family or freinds have a get together at the The Lake Erie Metropark,</p>
          <p>and then drive you back, so that you can enjoy the BBQ.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Overall, I think every park deserves an adventure into,</p>
          <p>they usually have more to offer than aparking area.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>For example the Lower Huron Metropark has a <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/zXCrFpsGnYfZHQxi7">Turtle Cove Family Aquatic Center</a> attraction,</p>
          <p>people go there to swim in the summer.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Personally, I really enjoyed a small pick-nick I setup for myself one summer,</p>
          <p>at a lonely bench by the tiny <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/ju7Cw4jM2Wx5e6kv7">Washago Pond</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

        <div class="section">
          <p>As to the bicycle it self...</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Riding a bicycle takes a little while to get used to,</p>
          <p>and I recommend a soft seat, with extra padding.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And actually buying a bicycle and maintaining it is not hard,</p>
          <p>because you want a simple bicycle.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Don&apos;t buy one with crazy shifters and break handles,</p>
          <p>and break discs, wires and lines.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It will all squeak, it will need annoying adjustments,</p>
          <p>it will rust, or bend and sometimes fall out.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The less a bike has the less will get broken,</p>
          <p>with the exception of the tires, get a simple $300 fat tire bike.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Sometimes you get a lemon, so be ready to take it back to the store for a quick replacement,</p>
          <p>I own a Mongoose 26 Inch Brutus Alloy All Terrain Mountain Bike.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It cost me $150 at a local supermarket,</p>
          <p>as it was $100 off.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I replaced my Handlebar with one meant for an ATV,</p>
          <p>as it is few inches wider, but the older one was not too bad.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I only needed to remove once screw to replace the handlebar,</p>
          <p>since there are no break handles or gear shifters to mess with.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The way you stop the bike, is by moving the pedals backwards a little bit,</p>
          <p>there is breaking mechanism that is triggered by that reverse motion.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It does get loud on the trail because it runs by a highway,</p>
          <p>so just in case it gets too annoying bring some foam earplugs make sure they are rated NRR 33.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And remember sun tan lotion,</p>
          <p>and bug repellent.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>All the adventures out there are stunning,</p>
          <p>no matter where you go.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Add some music or audio books,</p>
          <p>and short weekends will slowly transform into long and adventure filled vacations.</p>
