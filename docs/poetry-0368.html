          <p>If I only had to say one thing about it,</p>
          <p>I&apos;d say:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>&quot;You create a tiny product by putting in a tiny amount of effort.&quot;</p>
          <p>How tiny?,</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>My smallest product,</p>
          <p>was 6x4 pixels small.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I generated my own <a href="https://colorhunt.co/">color swatches</a> via the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAw2_NtGNaA">HSL Color Model</a></p>
          <p>randomly colored my some of my pixels, and then re-sized my little 6x4 creation to 4K (3840 &#xD7; 2160).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I resized it using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy_2Dncb26s">ImageMagick</a>,</p>
          <p>which by default will blur the end result to create a beautifully smooth background.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I uploaded them to <a href="https://creativemarket.com/">Creative Market</a> as 4K Desktop Backgrounds,</p>
          <p>and a made $60 in sales, before I shut the experiment down.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I had another $60 there already,</p>
          <p>from a much more complex product.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>One that took months, and generated 30,000 <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/card/">Bootstrap Card</a> designs, and had a variation that was connected to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XKRxeo9414">Stripe</a>.</p>
          <p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7CfaDYzTVM">Bootstrap</a> helps with Graphic User Interface design, and Stripe is a Payment Processing Gateway)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I fully embrace failure in my product design,</p>
          <p>I almost want it, because that is the best way to learn.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Make your products small and beautiful,</p>
          <p>and learn from your failures.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I classified my computer creations as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmfC-i9WgH0">Minimum Viable Products</a>,</p>
          <p>and I continue my search for tiny and valuable things, I am currently looking at automatically generating dance and workout music.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If you don&apos;t like computers,</p>
          <p>then that maybe even better.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZlEbttaO0">Adam Savage of Myth Busters fame has a small video about hand made products</a>,</p>
          <p>in which he mentions markets like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UISLd3-KN8">Etsy</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Hand made does not mean hard work,</p>
          <p>you kind of probably should sell products that are not yet assembled - so product kits.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You can manufacture them by looking around for a local business that will help you machine parts,</p>
          <p>or online where you can 3D print prototypes or laser cut leather, or wood, or acrylic, with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaxwSVr3cl8">Shapeways</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOTUw6Iz2GY">Ponoko</a></p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You can also find a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wti6FMvDAE4">Maker Space</a>,</p>
          <p>where you maybe able to find the tools and advice you need.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

        <div class="section">
          <p>I know that selling <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOTUw6Iz2GY">cute wooden charms</a> is not a way to build a business,</p>
          <p>but holding your first product in your hands is a very educational experience, and money well spent.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Plus, you get a new item for your design portfolio,</p>
          <p>where you can beautifully feature your diagrams, sketches, and ideas.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Your earliest products,</p>
          <p>are priceless, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex2ALzWigB8">in 30 years as you look through your portfolio your silly wooden charms will make you very proud</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The distance to a good product from a silly little charm,</p>
          <p>is actually just a few more sketches, and a CNC &amp; Laser Cutter shop <a href="https://www.trayvax.com/">where you can design a range of pricey wallets</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Or, wallet kits, where you ship a futuristic wallet along with a little screwdriver and shiny brass screws,</p>
          <p>allowing the customer to customize it during the final assembly.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Think of it as outsourcing your assembly to the customer,</p>
          <p>and passing on the savings.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And if you prefer more modern technology,</p>
          <p>then <a href="https://www.etsy.com/search?q=Raspberry+PI+Case">design a range of cases for the Raspberry PI</a>, here it makes even greater sense to ship it as a kit, and of course you don&apos;t need to include the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKPobkb1N6o&amp;t=20">Raspberry PI</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Just accept failure as part of progress,</p>
          <p>and focus on design a range of very interesting products, for three reasons.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Learning the work flow, beginning with customer interest,</p>
          <p>onward to sales, and getting a nice review, or rating.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Learning from failure,</p>
          <p>or you can call it: slowly seeking a path to success.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And filling your portfolio with beautiful sketches and prototypes,</p>
          <p>documenting your path to success, and later on publishing your Design Portfolio as an actual book that people all over the world can use for inspiration.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is better to start slowly a little bit at a time,</p>
          <p>focus on creating miniature side-businesses first, enjoy the product design, and leave nothing out of your portfolio.</p>
