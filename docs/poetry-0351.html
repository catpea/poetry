          <p>Theory, is useful after you don&apos;t need it,</p>
          <p>don&apos;t do things because others tell you to do them.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You are too unique, you are too grand, too unstoppable, too unbreakable,</p>
          <p>to fit any theory.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Some theories are broken... college is broken,</p>
          <p>future expects more of you, you will have to show evidence of exceptional ability.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Some theories are misleading,</p>
          <p>and you end up in a place you didn&apos;t really want.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And when you turn around for answers,</p>
          <p>you get the worst of them all, a real curse.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You hear,</p>
          <p>&quot;How were we supposed to know?&quot;.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Listen to good advice,</p>
          <p>but also ask your Elder Self what regrets you feel, and the sands of time, and the butterflies wing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Do not follow,</p>
          <p>lead the way.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Did you know, you don&apos;t even need music theory to make music, you don&apos;t need to practice the piano,</p>
          <p>and train your fingers, we have computers now.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Sure, Music Theory maybe easy to learn,</p>
          <p>and it is easy to spot music by another person that uses the theory.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is shocking to see a composer,</p>
          <p>that does not use the theory, it is outrageous, out of control.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If you don&apos;t employ proper use of scales,</p>
          <p>the Noble Tuba Men, will run out of octaves and semitones.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You will make everyone angry,</p>
          <p>and most of your orchestra will walk out on you, some may cry, some will be angry.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Few will stay,</p>
          <p>just to see &quot;How dare you?&quot;.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But you must dare,</p>
          <p>you have to.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You have to begin composing,</p>
          <p>before you learn the damn theory.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Your greatest energy,</p>
          <p>your raw power, lies within the younger you, the unchained melody of you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You have to sing free,</p>
          <p>you have to scribble incomprehensible notes, madly, upon a roof in winter, bareFOOT.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You must resist the teachers, maybe permanently so,</p>
          <p>or you will end up, a mere part of the orchestra.</p>
        </div>

          <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCb0TsSIqI0">Why?</a></p>
          <p>Because you must <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAgdd2VqLVc">reign alone</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We have to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52P3aX_6EqA">search for multiple ways of understanding the world for what it really is</a>,</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KhwjboHHWw">not just listen to what others are trying to sell us, but rise in all ways possible</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If we listened, to what others wanted to teach us...</p>
          <p>humanity would still be stuck in the worst parts of dark ages.</p>

          <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqODySSxYpc">Leave. The. Old Theory. Alone.</a></p>
          <p>And <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWLp7lBomW8">invent your own</a>, and don&apos;t stop, ever.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

        <div class="section">
          <p>People will misunderstand you,</p>
          <p>it is OK, they do it for making friends with other people that feel the same.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And they wouldn&apos;t have understood you even if you did what they wanted you to do,</p>
          <p>but what kind of a person would have been then?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>What is the theory there?</p>
          <p>good grades, good college, good job, good memories, and good bye, because <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovJcsL7vyrk">we do not live in that kind of world</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We are born into a cosmos of infinity,</p>
          <p>we are not to cage ourselves.</p>

          <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw4Le_EEI8w">We are to break away</a>,</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We are to live a Wise and Inspiring,</p>
          <p>Noble and Beautiful Life of Infinite Complexity.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Live as if you were to inspire all the future generations to Greatness,</p>
          <p>and begin by asking your Elder and Wise Self, what your regrets are.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Live and Compose Beautifully,</p>
          <p>and may your noblest ideas spread to no end.</p>
