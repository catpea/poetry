          <p>A lonely ancient stone bear,</p>

          <p>it has been seen as a very special place as the mountain is surrounded by flat lands.</p>

          <p>Thousands of years ago,</p>
          <p>it was a place where people worshiped the sun.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Some ancient artist decided to build a stone bear up there,</p>
          <p>and so she stands to this day.</p>

          <p>A second bear,</p>

          <p>It is of Celtic origin, probably the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boii">Boii Tribe</a> of the Iron Age</p>

          <p>She sleeps in the winter,</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Arti&#x14D; is compared to the Greek Goddess Artemis,</p>

          <p>But, somehow I ended up being the bear,</p>
