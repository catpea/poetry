        <div class="section">
          <p>To understand the world, you must stop assuming that everything is how it should be.</p>
          <p>You have to get used to the idea that the world needs your help, almost nothing works.</p>
          <p>You will be able to see examples of that everywhere, once you take time to listen to, and read books.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="section">
          <p>Other than noticing that everything is incomplete, you will never fully grasp the world.</p>
          <p>The understanding of the world, is a process, it must be.</p>
          <p>You can only understand the things that call to you, and that education is the key.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="section">
          <p>Most, if not all misunderstandings are rooted in greatly varying levels of education.</p>
          <p>When levels of real education rise, the world becomes wiser.</p>
          <p>As the world grows in wisdom, misunderstandings fade away and Peace arrives.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="section">
          <p>Not all education is equal, real education is rare.</p>
          <p>It is far simpler to take to the books that call to you, than to wait for a teacher that can inspire you.</p>
          <p>Be careful when it comes to organized education, it is safer to learn directly from the world&apos;s most beloved thinkers.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="section">
          <p>Eventually you will no doubt hope to make a difference, but there is a great and heartbreaking problem with that.</p>
          <p>It may not be possible to help those who are already suffering, it may only be realistic to make their pain count more, by preventing it in the future.</p>
          <p>Not all great challenges are like this, but once a war starts, there are no winners, nor will there ever be.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="section">
          <p>To make changes that last, you may have to focus on prevention.</p>
          <p>You have to look into the future, as you won&apos;t be able to reliably change the present, not always.</p>
          <p>To reliably change the future, you must help the world learn, increases the world&apos;s level of education.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="section">
          <p>You have to help the world remember, that it was lack of knowledge that kept the world in misery.</p>
          <p>Your greatest adversaries will not only tower over you, but will outlive you by centuries.</p>
          <p>They will turn misery and borders, into profit, a minuscule amount from billions of people.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="section">
          <p>The word kind of an education, is the one that stops the student from learning more.</p>
          <p>Be it with false promises, fantasies, or by replacing real education with meaningless memorization tests and grades.</p>
          <p>Once a student becomes either convinced that they know enough, or tricked into not wanting to learn anymore, the world becomes darker for it.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="section">
          <p>Dark ages is not a thing that you can witness, as they are spread across multiple centuries.</p>
          <p>The darkness is just the symbol, for lack of education, lack of enlightenment.</p>
          <p>The future generations will be able to see it when looking back at us, but we won&apos;t.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="section">
          <p>The urgency with which every human being, must be given books and knowledge in a way that helps them grow, is of an order of magnitude higher than we can comprehend.</p>
          <p>Screaming Climate, Pandemics, Wars, Racism, Concentration Camps, Solitary Confinement, Police Brutality, and Punishment By Death, will do nothing to help the world understand.</p>
          <p>Most don&apos;t even know about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_extinction">Holocene Extinction</a>, all of this is a function of their level of education.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="section">
          <p>Our Empathy and Compassion for each other, also scales with Knowledge.</p>
          <p>We are all born perfect, and we are all beautiful.</p>
          <p>But we must not start at zero, we must be born to the greatest heights of the previous generation.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="section">
          <p>Without real education, not only do we repeat the same mistakes.</p>
          <p>But we keep adding more weight to them, and make the suffering of the previous generations count for nothing.</p>
          <p>Real education enhances us, it improves us, and refines our operating system, decision making mechanisms, and powers of perception.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="section">
          <p>You can&apos;t stand up to a war, a global cult, or fantasy education, you will be so small they won&apos;t even notice you.</p>
          <p>But you can prevent it from propagating into the future, help your classmates, protect them from fake teacher, share narrated books.</p>
          <p>Use the stress of fake education to ignite their passion for True Wisdom, help them see the Liars and the Fools, help them see the fraud of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmoor8DwqW4">Fake Education</a>.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="section">
          <p>Help them see how in poverty those who claim authority, trade the Best Minds of The Future Generation, for a small paycheck.</p>
          <p>The propagation of the darkness-and-misery of our age, under the collective and self defeating excuse...</p>
          <p>of putting some food, on their table.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="section">
          <p>Above all, and in more ways, than we can grasp.</p>
          <p>The following words, will always hold true.</p>
          <p>It is either all of us, or none.</p>
