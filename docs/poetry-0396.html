          <p>One of the worst things that can happen to a Human Being,</p>
          <p>is being tricked into thinking that they are an ordinary person.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Being tricked into thinking that they are not as intelligent as the A+ kids,</p>
          <p>or not as good as the ones with rich parents.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The measure of a person comes from within,</p>
          <p>and can only be ignited with a deliberate pursuit of Real Knowledge and Real Wisdom.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We can all image a person tricked into thinking that they are a worker,</p>
          <p>and being worked until old age, just to discover it was all a lie.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>People that trick us this way are many,</p>
          <p>a lot of people are constantly searching to simplify their life.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>That is an awful thing to do and not really that different from manipulating and lying,</p>
          <p>they take advantage of people that don&apos;t yet know to protest.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

        <div class="section">
          <p>Children are taught to keep away from stray dogs and strangers,</p>
          <p>but there is nobody to tell them that we are born noble and meant to become great.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It would be very difficult for a recruiter to take advantage of an impressionable mind,</p>
          <p>had they been taught that wars and borders are a symptom of not thinking, of lack of wisdom and foresight.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In a world where we are taught that we are noble creatures,</p>
          <p>we will become incorruptible, and bullies will be seen as sick.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The difference between being tricked into thinking that we are ordinary,</p>
          <p>and being taught and inspired into knowing that we are each mean to become a great being.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Is the key.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The Key to World Peace, to turning money from a noose,</p>
          <p>to a tool for flourishing and well being, and growing all the way up.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Without that key, that belief that we are extraordinary,</p>
          <p>we have a tendency to retreat and shelter.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>With the key, we develop an unshakable dignity,</p>
          <p>and that unbreakable spirit, necessary for change to take root.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Can you see what a massively limiting and corrupting mistake it is,</p>
          <p>to live what me may later learn, was not yet life.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

        <div class="section">
          <p>While we inherit best from Beloved Thinkers and Inspirational Philosophers,</p>
          <p>by taking to their books, and narrated versions as well.</p>

          <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPSvdKTEZug">The Beginning</a> of the awakening to the realization that Human Beings are not ordinary,</p>
          <p>is not found in adding more knowledge, but in seeking less complexity.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The beginning is so pleasant, and so beautiful, that it almost seem too good to be true.</p>
          <p>the beginning is found in adventure with kin, or kind, out on the world&apos;s longest trails.</p>

          <p>We each have a capacity to move mountains, but we have to be mindful of it,</p>
          <p>so that we don&apos;t exhaust our power on temporary or fleeting things.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The great power lies within aligning our days in such a way as to imbue each new day,</p>
          <p>with the achievements of all the previous days; so that we live each new day with our entire life force.</p>

          <p>You are an extraordinary creature whose greatness is fulled by Knowledge, Experience, and Wisdom,</p>
          <p>you are meant to become an Unshakable, Unbreakable, and Unstoppable, Noble and Wise Great Being.</p>
