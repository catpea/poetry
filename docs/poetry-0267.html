          <p>Greatness is not a question of having it or not,</p>
          <p>it is whether or not you use it a little or a lot.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>We will each be asked to become Wise and Great,</p>
          <p>to save the world from mediocrity and hate.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>All battles for goodness are already won,</p>
          <p>and before you know it, your great task will be done.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>But first, we need to learn to reject the status quo,</p>
          <p>set off on a quest for wisdom, and enlightenment, and go.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>You never really fight in a good war,</p>
          <p>the enemy in their madness never makes it out the door.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>But Greatness will call to you non the less,</p>
          <p>it will ask you to speak about Wisdom, Love, Growing Up, and Kindness.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>You see many Great Beings smile when facing wrath,</p>
          <p>that powerful joy comes from the certainty of walking the right path.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>Those who walk the wrong path, age quickly and fade,</p>
          <p>and history books will soon-enough reveal their charade.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>The Noble Greatness within us all is forged to last,</p>
          <p>and the opportunities ahead are as beautiful as vast.</p>
