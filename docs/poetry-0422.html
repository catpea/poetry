          <p>&quot;Lady doth protest too much, for rather, is easier to be an inventor,</p>
          <p>than not to be one.&quot;</p>
          <p>- William F. Shakespeare.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The world is your oyster,</p>
          <p>the components with which you invent things are all around you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You do not want to invent complicated things,</p>
          <p>but rather improve the things that people are used to.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>To give a few examples,</p>
          <p>of amazing findings.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Samsung&apos;s Exploding Batteries,</p>
          <p>was quite an eye opener.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It taught me, that hardware is second,</p>
          <p>it is a bad idea to manufacture your own hardware.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is best to encourage many companies to develop the hardware,</p>
          <p>and than just make sure that your operating system of choice runs on it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And the operating system of choice today is <a href="https://postmarketos.org/">postmarketOS</a>,</p>
          <p>which is based on <a href="https://alpinelinux.org/">Alpine Linux</a> and comes with multiple UI styles.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The RaspberryPI, it is the modern Commodore 64,</p>
          <p>it is the development machine, and it hasn&apos;t got a single flaw.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Single board computers of today,</p>
          <p>will change the future.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Plus,</p>
          <p>they will power the thing I am about to mention next.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Alexa, Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant, are a step in the right direction,</p>
          <p>but a very small step, unfortunately.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But the way these technologies made it into our homes,</p>
          <p>is an amazing idea.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And before I go further, let me just emphasize,</p>
          <p>that you are a programmer without a language.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We have Zapier and IFTTT, to some degree Automator,</p>
          <p>but like the Assistants Above this is a tiny step.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The average person,</p>
          <p>deserves a programming language.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And now, imagine what I would call an Agent Network,</p>
          <p>an anthropomorphized internet of things, where hardware devices are dressed up as assistants.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And hang out in a chat-room together,</p>
          <p>the use of bots in chartooms is nothing new, and that is good, you want to invent as little as possible.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The bots can talk to each other in the chat room,</p>
          <p>Siri, can get Alexa to reorder things, and Cortana can get the Roomba going.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But that is the least of it,</p>
          <p>all we did in this example, was to reduce the bloated technologies.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Here we are replacing IFTTT,</p>
          <p>with some bots that issue commands and some bots that execute them.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The real fun comes in when you replace your <a href="https://www.olafalo.net/thermostat/">thermostat with a Rasperry PI</a>,</p>
          <p>and give it a human name to turn it into another assistant that Siri, for example can talk to.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This gets us to a point, where there exist a chat-room with multiple robots,</p>
          <p>that can list the commands they understand, and the commands will be in plain English.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You control which bots are in which chat room,</p>
          <p>this serves as a security and customization mechanism.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>At this point, we add a new robot,</p>
          <p>one with a programming language that is easy to understand and mange.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This would be a WikiWikiWeb like program,</p>
          <p>that revolves around the EventEmitter pattern.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Here user can create text pages,</p>
          <p>but also event-handler pages, that conveniently list what emits events and what listen to them under the &quot;What Links Here?&quot; section.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>One of the most useful events here is incoming-text which would be coming in from the chat-room IN ENGLISH,</p>
          <p>and here a GUI interface would help the user either drop the message, or do something with it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Sometimes that something could be as simple as</p>
          <p>conditionally contributing to the ongoing bot conversation in the chat-room.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>So the Thermostat Bot, lets call her Amber,</p>
          <p>could report that that she is about to turn the heat on because it is only 65 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Let us create a new bot, let us call her Bia, named after the Greek goddess of force, anger and raw energy</p>
          <p>and she will be responsible for conserving energy when nobody is home.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Bia will respond to Amber to delay that order,</p>
          <p>until human presence is detected in the house, by the security system.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And programming this only deals with selecting Amber,</p>
          <p>as the bot to listen to, entering the text to monitor for which in this case is:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>&quot;I am about to turn the heat on because it is only * degrees Fahrenheit&quot;,</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Exiting the program early,</p>
          <p>if the security bot Ansel reports human presence,</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And if the program keeps going this far,</p>
          <p>then issuing a delay order to Amber.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This is a very simple programming language,</p>
          <p>that revolves around basic input forms and easy to read text.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Most of this would already be preset by the publisher,</p>
          <p>but it is still accessible and understandable by the user.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This whole thing requires nothing more,</p>
          <p>than a chat room, and a vision beyond a single assistant.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Imagine that couple returning from a weekend vacation,</p>
          <p>noticing the long conversation log between Amber and Bia...</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>...and modifying Amber&apos;s code to directly speak with Ansel,</p>
          <p>the security bot that keeps track of presence of humans in the house.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>What we are doing here,</p>
          <p>is bringing every program under the same interface, the interface of Chat and Text.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You can still play computer games,</p>
          <p>and browse the internet with the latest browser.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But there is also an IRC server,</p>
          <p>where the robots in your house talk to each other.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And EventEmitter flavored WikiWikiWeb,</p>
          <p>designed to outlast the house, designed long term operations.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>There is never a problem with remembering what robots are in the house,</p>
          <p>as they all hang out in the lobby of the chat system.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And it is not always necessary to program a thing,</p>
          <p>sometimes just logging in and typing in &quot;@Amber Turn the heat up to 73&quot; will suffice.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In conclusion, to think like an inventor,</p>
          <p>look around you, the things that surround you, are the things that you manipulate to create something new.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Never complicate things,</p>
          <p>simplify them, you can&apos;t improve something by making it more complex.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Don&apos;t be evil, don&apos;t be small minded,</p>
          <p>life is too short for shallow thinking.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Your inventions, or independent-inventions,</p>
          <p>as little as caps that you put on laces in sweat pants so that you can pull the lace out should one be pulled in by the washer.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Or as big as big as the invention of a human readable programming language,</p>
          <p>belong in your thick portfolio.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Just imagine, shiny heavy covers with an intricate high resolution generative art graphic on the front,</p>
          <p>and your smiling face on the back... and maybe on the front too, why the heck not.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Don&apos;t think of it as your portfolio,</p>
          <p>but as a book of your inventions that also doubles as the portfolio.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You don&apos;t have to give TED talks,</p>
          <p>and these days you don&apos;t even need a publisher, just Printing On Demand.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And remember to think of the leading companies as your private research laboratories,</p>
          <p>pay attention to what they are doing where they are failing, and especially their shortcomings.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The business world is a dog scratch dog world,</p>
          <p>when you become world&apos;s most famous inventor, all of those companies will own and and study a copy of your portfolio.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Oh, and one more thing,</p>
          <p>always put a &quot;Don&apos;t be evil&quot; clause in your legal paperwork.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Once the lawyers start calling you if that part can be removed...</p>
          <p>just say, no, and hang up.</p>
