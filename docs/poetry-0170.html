        <section>
          <p>The present belongs to the current generation,</p>
          <p>therefore the current generations can be said to be the most important.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Much is to be said on the subject of the great mistakes of the most recent century,</p>
          <p>and just as importantly much is to be said about the mistakes we are repeating.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>History books are waiting to be read,</p>
          <p>they will help us understand current events across all nations.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>To correct things, however,</p>
          <p>is much more difficult.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>This is because we were born into the world long after things were put in motion,</p>
          <p>and the people in charge have not been granted the needed wisdom to understand their role.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>To put it simply,</p>
          <p>it is too late to teach the blind or corrupt.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Individuals who take part in harming the world, or preventing it from growing,</p>
          <p>are too far invested, too long gone to be helped.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And it is a matter of help.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Those who advertise products, that they know cause cancer or other illnesses, are sick, their minds are broken.</p>
          <p>they all once had an opportunity to become heroes, but they didn&apos;t know it.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I think we can assume, that in most situations,</p>
          <p>a human being will choose Goodness over Evil,</p>
          <p>unless they lack the Wisdom to tell the difference between the two.</p>

        <section>
          <p>The solution to all out problems is to first understand that we were born too late into all this,</p>
          <p>the momentum of Climate Change and Business as Usual, Mass Incarceration and Poverty was too high to be stopped by a singe generation.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>But it is hardly a challenge for a Wiser World,</p>
          <p>a world that helps children to wisdom so that they can become Great Beings come their middle age.</p>

          <p>We can&apos;t say the word &quot;poverty&quot; and sound like it is a cruel world,</p>
          <p>we have to make it clear that it is a broken world looking for New Heroes, New Intellectuals, and New Leaders.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>We can&apos;t say the word &quot;prison&quot; and make it sound like that&apos;s where bad people go,</p>
          <p>we have to show our pain, and speak about how no Human belongs in a cage, how they needed a fair start,</p>
          <p>and how prisons can only make a bad person worse.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>We can&apos;t talk about climate change as something that has no real solution in sight,</p>
          <p>but rather we have to say that adults today are not educated well enough, their minds are not great enough to comprehend the scale of the problem.</p>

        <section>
          <p>The world in its complexity, made it so that all of these heartbreaking problems,</p>
          <p>double as a challenge, an opportunity to not just grow in wisdom to fix these problems, but to grow in Greatness as well.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>The mistakes of today,</p>
          <p>when presented as such become an opportunity to help a generation grow far beyond what we perceived as our own limits.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Whenever there is a problem that is too great for a generation,</p>
          <p>know for certain that multiple consecutive generations will fix it, in their hard earned wisdom.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>My Friends,</p>
          <p>this is yet another reason to take to Books and Audio Books,</p>
          <p>to study best we can, so that we may teach.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>We maybe just a chain link in a world with many problems,</p>
          <p>but even a single chain-link keeps it all connected.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Slow down, I know you are working hard,</p>
          <p>slow down to a speed that lets you read books,</p>
          <p>read, learn, and rise to the challenge of inspiring generations to their greatness, and their destiny as teachers.</p>

        <section>
          <p>The momentum of the mistakes of today,</p>
          <p>will lose force in proportion to our ability to inspire the younger generation to greatness;</p>
          <p>our ability to show them just how important they are, to the past, the present, the future, how it is all inseparable together.</p>
