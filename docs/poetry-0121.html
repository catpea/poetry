          <p>No worries, the only real darkness is the Twilight of Hesitation,</p>
          <p>it is dangerous because it makes time go by all too fast.</p>

        <section>
          <p>So you just have to make a promise to your self,</p>
          <p>that each day will be a tiny-tiny itsy-bitsy better; than then previous.</p>

        <section>
          <p>Other than that, no cloud could ever stop the sun from rising,</p>
          <p>nothing can endanger your brilliance, there is nothing to fear.</p>
