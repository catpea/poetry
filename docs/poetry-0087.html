          <p>Waiting for the sun to inch down,</p>
          <p>before I go out in the town.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>My legs have become like two huge potatoes,</p>
          <p>but that&apos;s life, that&apos;s how it goes.</p>

        <section>
          <p>There are so many lovely people that notice me out there,</p>
          <p>yesterday a cute couple, lady with fancy hair.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>A couple of days ago, a gent from the gym,</p>
          <p>slowly walking and wondering &quot;Is that him?&quot;</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Oh yeah, that was me! I shaved my mustache,</p>
          <p>and taught my self to dash.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Sure I run at the speed of a sickly gastropod,</p>
          <p>but after my gym-dancing, don&apos;t even feel odd.</p>
        </section>

        <section>

        <section>
          <p>And before that, the ladies in the Jeep,</p>
          <p>I didn&apos;t wave back, I am sorry, I was in the middle of a huge leap.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And then the first person to notice me in my sluggish swim,</p>
          <p>might have been the Trainer! from the gym.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I was really tired in the middle of my early run,</p>
          <p>muttering &quot;I can&apos;t believe I have to run the same distance, before I am done.&quot;</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And then I heard &quot;Hi! Andre!&quot; and I instantly regained my strength,</p>
          <p>I could have run five times that length.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Sure, I am still learning, running tests and trails,</p>
          <p>but my aim is one hour, to do the whole five miles.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And you know what, just after two weeks,</p>
          <p>I run a lot faster; and I have rosy cheeks!</p>
