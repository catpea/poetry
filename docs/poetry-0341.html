        <div class="section">
          <p>A chord is when a person presses more than one piano keys to enrich a sound,</p>
          <p>some key combinations sound better than others.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>For no reason in particular, when the keys of a nicely sounding chord,</p>
          <p>are played one after another instead of all at once, something neat happens.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The tiny melody you make by breaking up the chord,</p>
          <p>sounds pretty good to the ear.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And it does not even matter what sequence you play those keys in,</p>
          <p>to give some kind of an explanation, the way I think of it is this:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Nicely sounding chords, are made up of friendly notes,</p>
          <p>and they are such good friends, that they can be played all at once or one after another.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>They go together,</p>
          <p>it is what friends do.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Listen to this example,</p>
          <p>I play a chord made up of three notes twice.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>(Chord meaning that I press the three notes all at once)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And then, I take all the three notes of the chord,</p>
          <p>shuffle them, and play them one after another.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>True to their friendship,</p>
          <p>they make a little nine note melody, here it is:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>* BROKEN CHORDS PLAY *</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Someone noticed this,</p>
          <p>and decided to create a little machine.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It would generate chords,</p>
          <p>break them up, and play them one after another.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>That machine is called:</p>
          <p>The Arpeggiator.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Of course, you know how machines are,</p>
          <p>they do a good job most of the way, but, yeeeeeesh, it never quite works.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It certainly wont make a song for you,</p>
          <p>the main melody won&apos;t be that great.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Take a listen to this, in this example I show you pure machine work,</p>
          <p>I just set the instruments, and turned on the Arpeggiator.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>At first I demonstrate what the instruments sound like all by themselves,</p>
          <p>and then I kind of try to make a song, it could work, but not quite, not always.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>* THE MACHINE MELODY PLAYS *</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But there is something, there is a french composer named Jean-Michel Jarre,</p>
          <p>that made a song named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4KMp22jBg">Oxygen</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I listened to Oxygen 2 a few times when I was little,</p>
          <p>and I always felt like it was full of Robots, Ghosts In The Machine, and Arpeggiators.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Today, I attempt to create a song inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj7A8SX7ccI" title="Jean-Michel Jarre&apos;s Oxygen 1">Oxygen 1</a>, a somewhat simpler version,</p>
          <p>and I only use the Arpeggiators.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD4KMp22jBg">Jean-Michel Jarre&apos;s Oxygen 2</a> has a very strong and very pretty melody,</p>
          <p>and an Arpeggiator just can&apos;t handle creating that, not reliably.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>So here is my robotic and automated take on Oxygen 1,</p>
          <p>enjoy.</p>
