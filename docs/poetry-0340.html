          <p>I know what your initial worries are,</p>

          <p>This type of &quot;I am superior&quot;,</p>

          <p>When you buy into this &quot;I am holier than thou&quot; s**t,</p>
          <p>something important is taken away from you.</p>

          <p>it is bad etiquette to use that word once you do master something.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The word Genius, or Savant,</p>
          <p>is a bad word, because it has been used to rob Humanity of Beauty.</p>

          <p>When teachers grade you down, for something you forgot,</p>
          <p>because you never used it, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voytGLvtsy0">they tried to teach you in an abstract setting</a> and it made no sense.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Or they forced you to memorize it so you could perform on a test like an actor,</p>
          <p>or just told you that the world is not fair.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>They committed the same crime against you,</p>
          <p>and against Humanity, and History.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Their motive, is not sick superiority,</p>
          <p>but just getting paid, for a job they often hate, so that thy can another miserable day as a fraud.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The number of Great Dreamers that were prevented from growing because of teachers,</p>
          <p>is so high, that one can only weep.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We are taught to respect and listen to teachers,</p>
          <p>but it is them, who have sold the world.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>(If any teachers are listening to this, it is time to stop making your kids memorize, either help them grow for real, or get out of their way,</p>
          <p>remember those old metaphors, what goes around comes around, you reap what you sow, and whatever you send out there, you get back times three.)</p>

          <p>Once you play the French Horn, a second wave or morons will stroll your way,</p>
          <p>they will tell you that you will never be as good as Tchaikovsky.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Once your music hits the European Dance Floors,</p>
          <p>another wave of fools will come...</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And they will tell you that you will never win the Tchaikovsky Competition,</p>
          <p>where artists are still taught to use their fingers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And they will keep coming,</p>
          <p>the only way to stop the critics from trying to stop you, is to stop listening.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Stop listening to people that are not just saying you can&apos;t,</p>
          <p>but attempt to convince you with fake education, fake meaningless grades, and endless insults.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

        <div class="section">
          <p>Never forget that you can make your own competition,</p>
          <p>one attached to a school you build, perhaps a virtual school for all.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Perhaps not just a school where you teach how to use Digital Audio Workstations,</p>
          <p>but how to use Programming Languages the way <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TK1mBqKvIyU">Sam Aaron</a> uses them.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And certainly a school,</p>
          <p>where you put an end to killing souls of artists.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The French Horn is more than Tchaikovsky could grasp,</p>
          <p>in the primitive era that he was alive in.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>That&apos;s right, this is a new era,</p>
          <p>an era where professional artists worry about falling behind to teenagers with computers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I know what you are thinking,</p>
          <p>I know nothing about notes, I can&apos;t compose.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Maybe you are thinking,</p>
          <p>I don&apos;t know music theory.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Or perhaps,</p>
          <p>I don&apos;t know what a French Horn even, freaking is.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But,</p>
          <p>is this what your ear worries about?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Music, is not about knowing where to put your fingers,</p>
          <p>it is about creating a road forward, one of Beauty and adventure.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I want you to hear, what it is like to compose music from your soul,</p>
          <p>from your heart, unafraid, in a world where if you fail, you will come back the next day.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And the next day, you will feel nothing but certainty,</p>
          <p>and a kinship with all the others, including Tchaikovsky, no matter how old fashioned his use of The Horn is.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And if you fail again, and my goodness I hope you do, then, then, your mind will begin taking notes apart, it will rip through brass,</p>
          <p>out of an animal like yearning for comprehension of composition.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It will come as automatically as running, as learning to ride a bicycle,</p>
          <p>in just a few more failures, just a few more failures, you will earn it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You will hear it, whatever your instrument of choice,</p>
          <p>you will hear it in popular music, because there are countless other lovers out there.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Some of them, still learning, some still tricked by teachers,</p>
          <p>others, your upcoming competition, racing forward as fast as yo are.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The Pursuit of Excellence does not distinguish,</p>
          <p>the original instrument, or the synthesized one.</p>

          <p>Do you know what this process of note seeking, is called?</p>
          <p>It is called composition, and do not let anybody tell you otherwise.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>THE PROCESS OF FINDING THE RIGHT NOTES,</p>

          <p>YOU DO NOT MAKE MUSIC,</p>
          <p>BY LISTENING TO TEACHERS TELLING YOU HOW MUSIC IS MADE.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Do you hear me,</p>
          <p>do you hear me...</p>

          <p>And this is not a secret, it is just how bad schools have become,</p>
          <p>how easily we have listened to the teachers, how strong the imperceptible grasp of whatever it is that we perceive as authority.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If there is a secret to be had here,</p>
          <p>it is that school is the last place you go to learn.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And that is is the first place.</p>

          <p>Now, here is the whole song, and oh my gosh, please forgive the drums at the end, I couldn&apos;t help it,</p>
          <p>this is my first day learning the horn, and it is even MORE POWERFUL than I thought.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And believe me, you can do anything,</p>
          <p>those who stand in your way are just bad dreams.</p>
