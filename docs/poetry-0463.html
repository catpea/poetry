        <div class="section">
          <p>I would often murmur to myself</p>
          <p>&quot;Reality is a brick wall&quot;.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Any and all that move against it,</p>
          <p>will have a hard time.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Even in these treasured days,</p>
          <p>when my poems run particularly wild, that, holds, true.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I now worry for People, Judges and Politicians,</p>
          <p>because I know many move against the grain of reality, and some had their minds poisoned.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is very sad,</p>
          <p>but we must look to the future generations, and protect _them_ from gaining that tragic momentum.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The overall formula,</p>
          <p>is simple.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Self Education will lead you to Knowledge, Wisdom and Greatness,</p>
          <p>Greatness will grant you the power to build a new class of schools and ignite the beginning of Real Education.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You now gain the ability to kindle the spirits of countless students,</p>
          <p>help them understand the importance of fine education.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And have the guard it,</p>
          <p>knowing that when we lose the height the previous generation reached, we will be damned to re-learn their lessons.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Once the Truly Educated reach the middle age,</p>
          <p>an age of convergence will arrive.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Humanity, will grow up a little,</p>
          <p>as all the cultures enhance themselves with fine wisdom and converge on Unity and Peace.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Without real and international education that knows no bounds,</p>
          <p>the wold will become ever more divided.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="section">
          <p>The minds poisoned by the currents of dark ages and myriads of indoctrination, will yank us back, and choke us,</p>
          <p>to prevent Peace, Unity, Prosperity, Wisdom, and Progress; and propagate Hate, Hunger, Poverty, Dark Ages, Divisions, Lies, and Manipulations.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Real Schools,</p>
          <p>are the only way.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The faster we converge,</p>
          <p>the less suffering, war, and regret.</p>
        </div>
