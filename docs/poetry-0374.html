        <div class="section">
          <p>You have to learn a tiny bit at a time,</p>
          <p>and sometimes let what you are learning dictate a new path forward, so as long as it is interesting.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>For example, I&apos;ve been looking over the LB302 instrument that comes with lmms,</p>
          <p>the <a href="http://linuxsynths.com/LB302PatchesDemos/lb302.html">302 developers homepage has plenty of demos if you don&apos;t have lmms handy</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It says that the LB302 is inspired by the 1980 era Roland TB-303 Bassline synth,</p>
          <p>a quick look on YouTube reveals a great great example of programming in a song.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Doctor Mix (no relation), is recreating Donna Summer&apos;s masterpiece under the title,</p>
          <p>&#x201C;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBSN1_9Geo&amp;t=43s">The Bass Line Of I Feel Love On A TB-303</a>&quot;</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p><a href="https://learningmusic.ableton.com/song-structure/i-feel-love.html">Donna Summer is also mentioned in Ableton&apos;s Learning Music Tutorial</a>,</p>
          <p>noting that her masterpiece was an early example of music with almost entirely electronic instrumentation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>With modern software, the user interface is a lot more consistent,</p>
          <p>a simple program like lmms almost does not care what instrument is playing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And the LB302, though very different from the TB-303,</p>
          <p>actually creates an easier on-ramp, it is just five buttons and six knobs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>What a fantastic invitation,</p>
          <p>to play with a fancy instrument.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>A YouTube user named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pM4j-T1kCM">Michael Gregory has a remake of the song loaded in FL Studio</a>,</p>
          <p>and you can see what a simple setup it is, it is just about seven instruments and the vocals.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This is a very famous song,</p>
          <p>that simplicity is yet another invitation to a new tangent, that will eventually result in you becoming a world class musician.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

        <div class="section">
          <p>My interest in the piano opening of Faded by Alan Walker,</p>
          <p>has not faded at all.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I the melody is so simple.</p>
          <p>it in it self is a call to create a library of such simple melodies.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Beneath the melody, are chords,</p>
          <p>and again very simple, and very beautiful.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The way notes are arranged in here is just,</p>
          <p>one thing, another thing, and repeat.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Walker moves up and down the scale,</p>
          <p>after sixteen beats or, a full measure to keep things interesting, and in harmony with melody.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But it is the same pattern,</p>
          <p>a-b-a-b-a-b-a-b on an on.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You can see that really well in the first 26 seconds of a video entitled,</p>
          <p>&quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8G0wPW694">Alan Walker - Fade - PIANO TUTORIAL</a>&quot;, where the left hand is playing the repeating pattern, and the right has the melody.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Searching for similar chord progressions in other songs,</p>
          <p>is yet another great adventure.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Mad World comes to mind, in a video entitled &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vs0pjK1engs">Mad World - Gary Jules ver. | Piano tutorial | Karaoke</a>&quot;,</p>
          <p>you get a really good example of the difference between the poetic chords and high pitched melody.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>All of this, right at your fingertips,</p>
          <p>you don&apos;t have to practice the piano or anything, you just reproduce the notes in the piano roll.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="section">

        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This is such a great way to learn,</p>
          <p>that the idea of taking a music class for this, makes me sad.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>So many people are denied music,</p>
          <p>and by the place that claims to teach it, that this is a great tragedy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>People are being tricked into thinking they are not musicians,</p>
          <p>I don&apos;t even know what to say anymore.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Self education, wow, once we start making connections, like actually see Roland TB-303, and what it used to be like programming those darn things,</p>
          <p>and now; how lucky we are to have a piano roll in a free program like lmms, where we can make music by clicking squares on a grid, you can&apos;t help but to learn.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And while Donna Summer is like the critical central instrument that makes the song,</p>
          <p>and Faded has a singer singing throughout the entire piece....</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>...it does not mean that songs require lyrics, not at all, not at all,</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQMLn7wgQQw">a piano cover of Mad World, is still a masterpiece</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>There truly is something magical about learning on our own,</p>
          <p>at our own pace, in just the precise sequence of things, especially when curiosities connect.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Like how Donna Summer&apos;s digital masterpiece connects LB302 and TB-303 and the Ableton Tutorial,</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1cpim5EAqI">and sets us off on an adventure looking at how Daft Punk created their beautiful songs</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is not a passion for music,</p>
          <p>it is curiosity at an enjoyable pace-forward that makes a musician.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Self education,</p>
          <p>has nothing to do with discomfort or stress, it is just not how real education works.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This entire text is like a gateway to music,</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrMTlpeSw8Y&amp;list=PLqazFFzUAPc4K1To5JTtR3cskcdRifM1M">lmms is not difficult, especially with a few tutorials</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is of some note that setting up Bandcamp is free,</p>
          <p>you just need album art, and a <a href="https://get.bandcamp.help/hc/en-us/articles/360007902213-How-do-I-get-paid-on-Bandcamp-">paypal account where Bandcamp will deposit money your song sales</a></p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You get to learn music from the greatest artists,</p>
          <p>and hope to sell it at the same time, more importantly you learn about money making, business, advertising, and get to reason about it, and day dream about it...</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>...and bother your classmates to buy your Sick New Album,</p>
          <p>which I can tell already is going to be, Radical, Notorious, and Cowabanga.</p>
