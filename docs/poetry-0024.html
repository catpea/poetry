          <p>Captain&apos;s Log: Day Nineteen of Quarantine.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Tomorrow, day twenty may have rhyme a plenty,</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>but it won&apos;t rhyme with quarantine, and that was unforeseen.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I waited all day to write,</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>to see if something interesting may bite.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I wanted to draw and paint, and dance and prance,</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>but ended up discovering a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6_QUhUPrF4">poem about taking chance</a>.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I ended up programming, music and art,</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I aimed to do something relaxing, but smart.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Such are meow days, and had been forever and more,</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>searching for all things special and all the things I adore.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Now, I am finishing today&apos;s poem, one foot already in bed,</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Though I already had my salad, I wonder if I should make some bread.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>That&apos;s sounds about right,</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I&apos;ll waddle downstairs and grab a bite.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Goodnight.</p>
