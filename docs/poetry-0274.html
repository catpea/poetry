          <p>Do you remember wondering about becoming an adult?</p>
          <p>wanting to be done with this dumb kid stuff and have Ice Cream... even in winter.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>Just being half pint is not that big of a deal,</p>
          <p>it is the not knowing, what adults know, that&apos;s the hard part.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>For some of us this is a book, or a manual, or the mystery of philosophy,</p>
          <p>but what we are actually trying to picture is... Wisdom.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>Even as babies we know that wisdom separates a child from an adult,</p>
          <p>it isn&apos;t just about growing older, anybody can just age, it is about Wisdom.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">

        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>Much of Wisdom comes from inheriting lifetimes of knowledge from books,</p>
          <p>the problem here is, that it is only one in ten books that will connect with us.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>When we stop on the ninth book,</p>
          <p>we also stop growing up.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>Standing still cuts Humanity with borders,</p>
          <p>in the face of lack of wisdom we fall to self-deception, or fantasy.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>And the first thing that deception and fantasy needs is reinforcement,</p>
          <p>in desperation to make it as real as possible, we utter that horrible curse:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>&quot;Mine is better than yours&quot;,</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>Be it color of skin, name of god, or country,</p>
          <p>only more divisions will follow.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>We divide in politics, medicine, neighborhood, opinions, rarity of cars, price of clothes,</p>
          <p>and sometimes even the price of shoes, and whether or not we can really afford them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>Without wisdom, Humanity&apos;s collective vision becomes unclear,</p>
          <p>and we begin moving in different directions, divided we will never find Peace.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <p>Let us take to wisdom, let us return to searching for beautiful books and adventures,</p>
          <p>may we grow, and converge on wisdom in our magnificent uniqueness.</p>
