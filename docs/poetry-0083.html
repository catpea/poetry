          <p>I&apos;ve been sitting here for half an hour,</p>
          <p>trying to conjure up my poetic power.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>But nothing seems to be coming out,</p>
          <p>I think I am going through a poetic drought.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I guess this happens every once in a while,</p>
          <p>so it is not a reason not to smile.</p>
        </section>

        <section><img src="image/md-poetry-0083-guess.jpg" alt="Guess"></section>

        <section>
          <p>But I thought I was already better than that,</p>
          <p>I felt like the world&apos;s most poetic cat.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Now I struggle to come up with the next line,</p>
          <p>though I promise not to whine.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Maybe, there is way to break through by block,</p>
          <p>perhaps I should stop staring at the clock.</p>

        <section>
          <p>Oh yes, this worked, I feel much better meow!</p>
          <p>I remembered every word, wow!</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Wig, pig, pear, bear, sled, bed, boat, goat,</p>
          <p>top, mop, wall, ball, duck, truck, mouse house, and blouse.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And what a story that would rhyme,</p>
          <p>had I not ran out of time.</p>
