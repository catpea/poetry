          <p>For those of you who had trouble,</p>
          <p>finding the Northern end of the I-275 Bicycle Tail.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Hines connects North and South parts,</p>
          <p>but it is really hard to find the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/AimpKxWarbhiX8zbA">North Entry Point</a></p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I got on my bicycle today,</p>
          <p>and took some pictures.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>You have to find the M-14 Overpass,</p>
          <p>or an Overpass with a huge dark rail beneath.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>That rail is the support beam,</p>
          <p>for the Trail On-ramp.</p>

        <section>
          <p>A bit further down the road,</p>
          <p>there is a road that leads up to the On-ramp.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>It is a ramp specially made,</p>
          <p>for the Handsome Adventurous Bicyclist.</p>

        <section>
          <p>It opens like the door to a secret garden,</p>
          <p>very few people bicycle there.</p>
        </section>

        <section><img src="image/md-poetry-0119-continues.jpg" alt="Continues"></section>

        <section>
          <p>The trail continues for many more miles,</p>
          <p>all the way up to 14 Mile Road.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Over at 14 Mile it ends wonderfully unceremoniously,</p>
          <p>it just pops out onto a sidewalk.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Where motorists jump in their cars slightly,</p>
          <p>as you pop out somewhat dehydrated, a little crazed, and a bit wild.</p>
