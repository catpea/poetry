        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I spent the day doing Graphic Design.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Making art and poetry is quite fun,</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>though with the aid of computers, easily overdone.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I&apos;ve been doing this for so long, that I&apos;ve learned,</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>that, on computers, brevity is the Mother of Invention.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I am a huge fan, of the UNIX command line,</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>of the various little ways to get things done.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Graphic design, takes a different path,</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>it takes a while to switch between the two.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Programming languages, is where I spend most of my time,</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>its an in-between world, betwixt the two.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I&apos;ve been programming Music and Art,</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>It turned out not to be that hard.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>At the end of the day, what matters is the Masterpiece,</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>it matters not if it comes from Computers, Music or Art,</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>So as long as you finish what you start, and use your hart,</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>you are an Artist, and what you make, is Art.</p>
