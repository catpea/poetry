        <section>
          <p>Books and Audio Books,</p>
          <p>are as important to us as food.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>But many of us can&apos;t get into them,</p>
          <p>and there is a reason why.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Many lives are lived at a speed,</p>
          <p>that makes books hard to follow and understand.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>We lead busy lives,</p>
          <p>and majority of our time is spent in haste.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Haste brings us relief from,</p>
          <p>anxieties and confusing questions.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Part of the reason why haste,</p>
          <p>brings us relief.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Is that there is less time,</p>
          <p>to be bothered with things we don&apos;t understand.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <hr>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>This is the reason why many people, come their golden age,</p>
          <p>feel, that life was a lot shorter than they expected.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>In a word, haste blocks us,</p>
          <p>from experiencing our lives in full.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <hr>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Books hold all the answers that will address anxiety and confusion,</p>
          <p>but they require that the person exists the state of haste to understand them.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>As we read, comprehend, and inherit more and more,</p>
          <p>we&apos;ll hold enough answers to learn to live without the need for haste.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <hr>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>To slam the breaks,</p>
          <p>we need a change of scenery.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Section hiking Appalachian, of the Pacific Crest Trail,</p>
          <p>comes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPSvdKTEZug">highly recommended</a> by many great beings.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>But any kind of long adventure,</p>
          <p>where you have to go to sleep come sundown, will do.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <hr>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Even before you decide where you are headed,</p>
          <p>even before you get your backpack out.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>You will be able to see,</p>
          <p>how easy it will be to absorb your audio books as you walk through the woods.</p>

        <section>
          <p>What was once &quot;just moss&quot;,</p>
          <p>will not become a precious sunlit dew world.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Fern will now paint the world around you, perfectly hiding beautiful secret springs,</p>
          <p>little furry creatures, damn angry bears, and other woodland treasures.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>At twilight you will have to go to sleep,</p>

        <section>
          <p>And then the books will start calling you,</p>
          <p>maybe it will be &quot;A Walk In The Woods&quot; by Bill Bryson.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Or it could be &quot;The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark&quot;.</p>
          <p>by Carl Sagan, or &quot;The Partly Cloudy Patriot&quot; read in Sarah Vowell&apos;s amazing voice.</p>

        </section>
