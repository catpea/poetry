          <p>Where, sometimes, we all belong,</p>
          <p>and where life is very, very, very, very, long.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>As it winds along the well worn paths like a little song,</p>
          <p>and where there is always a right, that can fix a wrong.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And we are hardly ever alone, so as long as we stand strong,</p>
          <p>and you can achieve anything so as long as your effort is lifelong.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Many others traveled all these sandy roads,</p>
          <p>many handled much more weight and greater workloads.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>But it really all revolves about how much you learn, love, and know,</p>
          <p>that&apos;s what helps you get unstuck from that rainy office window.</p>

        <section>
          <p>We don&apos;t have to ride every crazy rodeo,</p>
          <p>live beneath an angry grumbling volcano.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Run as if chased by herds of stampeding buffalo,</p>
          <p>and like every corner hides a foe.</p>

          <p>Beautifully... it is best to live life slow,</p>
          <p>in tune with crickets, starry nights, frogs and rain, sunshine, and snow.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Live so slow as to have time to learn, think, and write,</p>
          <p>to share with others all that you found to be lovely and bright.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And not knowing what to write about, is the best,</p>
          <p>because that means Nordhouse is calling you, to a little quest.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And when you return, you will have to find a warm and cozy nook,</p>
          <p>grab a mug of chocolate and let your poems flow into your litte book.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Yup, you may need to pack a back pack, and give it a go,</p>
          <p>remember, life is longest, when you live it slow.</p>
