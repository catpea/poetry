          <p>Some years ago&#x2014;never mind how long precisely&#x2014;having</p>
          <p>little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me</p>
          <p>on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part</p>
          <p>of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and</p>
          <p>regulating the circulation.</p>

          <p>Whenever I find myself growing grim about</p>
          <p>the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever</p>
          <p>I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and</p>
          <p>bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever</p>
          <p>my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral</p>
          <p>principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and</p>
          <p>methodically knocking people&#x2019;s hats off&#x2014;then, I account it high time to</p>
          <p>get to sea as soon as I can.</p>

          <p>This is my substitute for pistol and ball.</p>
          <p>With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I</p>
          <p>quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they</p>
          <p>but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other,</p>
          <p>cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.</p>
