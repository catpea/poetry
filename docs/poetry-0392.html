          <p>Being a good programmer is very easy,</p>
          <p>if you keep everything in order.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It gets even easier when you program for yourself,</p>
          <p>you become a master of your world of little machines.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

        <div class="section">
          <p>Things get difficult when too many machines,</p>
          <p>start biting each other, this has been called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRsyY0kzXfw">Leaky Abstractions</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You can think of things inside a program as machines,</p>
          <p>some machines move objects that have named values.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Fox example a commonly used object is User,</p>
          <p>the name of a commonly used value is email, and value of email is user@example.com</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Such an object can be passed through a machine that detects bad email addresses,</p>
          <p>example.com is a special fake domain name, so it is a bad email address.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>When detected, the entire user object will be bounced, or sent, of copied over,</p>
          <p>to a program that suspends accounts, prevents the user with that email from longing in.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>When you fill out a login form on a website,</p>
          <p>you create a short lived login object, that goes into a system of such little machines.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>There could be a machine that has a list of bad emails that will CRUSH! this packet,</p>
          <p>and sent an error object back to the login page.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Or there could be a machine that right before password verification,</p>
          <p>checks if the user is suspended, and will just say &quot;Invalid Password&quot; instead.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If all you ever do is deal with these little object-passing machines,</p>
          <p>then that means you are a pretty good programmer.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But when you search for a job,</p>
          <p><a href="https://github.com/DopplerHQ/awesome-interview-questions#javascript">people will try to force you to know 50 different things</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>No one should tell you what you should excel at,</p>
          <p>or define what programming should consist of.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Nor are you allowed to focus on memorizing answers to those questions,</p>
          <p>because to really know an answer you have to encounter and solve the problem yourself.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In the course of you mastery of programming,</p>
          <p>you will bump into every interview question there is inside out.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Interviews are strange things, because you can build your own Object Oriented Language,</p>
          <p>and when asked about Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction, and Inheritance not recognize it as a definition of Object Oriented Programming.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>A definition using those four beautiful words is found in a school text book,</p>
          <p>if you don&apos;t associate those four words with OOP by having encountered them in a text book, you will fail the question.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Even if you build you own OOP systems, and especially if you frequently employ Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction, and Inheritance</p>
          <p>though other means, such as Event Oriented Programming, or Aspect Oriented Programming, Or Agent Oriented Programming.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Failing an interview does not make you a bad programmer,</p>
          <p>it makes you an expert in things that they can&apos;t conceive of.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Do you understand what this means,</p>
          <p>you can&apos;t expect schools to teach you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>What schools teach will make a mess out of you,</p>
          <p>you have to learn on your own.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The machines have to be yours,</p>
          <p>to connect together.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You must become a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqxwwuUdsp4" title="Ward Cunningham a R&#x14D;nin Samurai">R&#x14D;nin Samurai</a>,</p>
          <p>make people confused, embarrassed, maybe even angry.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The point of programming is not to get a job,</p>
          <p>it is to change the world.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The nay sayers will check me here,</p>
          <p>what good is a programmer that knows not how to operate DOM, or CouchDB or SQL.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But the answers is, my dear critic,</p>
          <p>what good are you for knowing those things.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>No good at all,</p>
          <p>it is all in your head.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>There are just two types of databases, in-memory, and on file system,</p>
          <p>if you combine the two together and prefix it with a append only log, you&apos;ll have all you need.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Keep your indexes in memory, name your directories after record id like in CouchDB,</p>
          <p>and updates with a version-number and a UUID so that they may be saved into that folder without overwriting anything.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Conflict resolution is achieved by looking at the UUID,</p>
          <p>just a simple sort on the UUID gives you the winner and thus eventual consistency.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Then just sync servers with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfj3bh77XB0">rsync</a>,</p>
          <p>remember all file names are named with a random UUID in it, no data will ever be overwritten, just updated.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Nay sayers, critics, benchmark sticklers, and ACID Database Test lovers,</p>
          <p>go home, eat your vegetables, and drink plenty of water.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In the world of programming you are always correct,</p>
          <p>because it is a world of your own making.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You are the creator of your software,</p>
          <p>and you also the hacker, the tester, and the administrator.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is easy to grasp what you have invented,</p>
          <p>and use what you have invented to understand, reverse engineer, and infer other technologies.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Your greatest power is simplicity and order,</p>
          <p>learn from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/WardCunningham">Ward Cunningham</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Mr. Cunningham connected WikiWikiWeb pages by removing spaces between capitalized words,</p>
          <p>if something was camel case, it would immediately become a link to a page named after those smushed words.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The only thing you needed to link pages together was: capitalizing the words you wanted to make a link out of, and removing spaces between them,</p>
          <p>system would detect an uppercase letter in the middle of a word, and turn it into a hyperlink to another page.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And best of all, if that page did not exist,</p>
          <p>it would say &quot;Hey there, stranger, this page does not exist yet, why don&apos;t you create it.&quot;</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Mr. Cunningham mentions the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx_WCIAM4bA">HyperCard</a>,</p>
          <p>and yes, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FquNpWdf9vg">HyperCard is a wonderful idea</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This is what being a programmer means,</p>
          <p>you start with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVwtVBpw7RQ">node</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YP_nOCO-4Q">electron</a> , and your first line of code, and then you move on to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFmuCDHHpwk">OOP</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtrnaTKqFPQ">EventEmitter</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Create your first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNdUVh3qCc">Game</a>, WikiWikiWeb, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzvqSVgc2t4">MUD</a>, or even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXW1ts6tZh4">Interactive Fiction Adventure</a>,</p>
          <p>or a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeId265HGnM&amp;list=PLgNJO2hghbmiACV9v_sdBwRLnEdKUlZ1s">bot</a>, or a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBQef0fs-_Q">music programming environment</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>So as long as you create your own systems,</p>
          <p>within your own realm, you will never get lost, and you will never stop learning about everything else.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Programmers are both R&#x14D;nin Samurai, and Real Magicians,</p>
          <p>they are unafraid to cast spells and build worlds, and create universes.</p>
