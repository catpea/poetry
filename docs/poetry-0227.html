          <p>Each human being contains precisely one labyrinth mostly consisting of a single long winding road with plenty of forks.</p>
          <p>this is their own perfect, private, personal, sacred curriculum.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>If they are granted the opportunity to follow it,</p>
          <p>at their own pace, in their own way, they will eventually become Wise.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>This wondrous road, must double as a library,</p>
          <p>and it can only contain Humanity&apos;s Noblest Works of Knowledge and Wisdom.</p>

          <p>The men who created, and rebuilt, and mixed up, and reformed the standardized education curricula,</p>
          <p>are politicians, bureaucrats, and fake it until you make artists with something but temporary to prove.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Most had agendas, made trades, deals, promises,</p>
          <p>some worked to compress one part, while others added more garbage to the next.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Unlike a road, there is no path that leads up the Tree of Knowledge here,</p>
          <p>the standardized curriculum is a patchwork of political fantasies.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>It shows a complete misunderstanding of the Human Condition,</p>
          <p>and great emphasis on easy administration of tests that only an uneducated voter would see any value in.</p>

          <p>There are no actors,</p>

        <section>
          <p>That beautiful road of questions and answers,</p>
          <p>forks, and diverging paths that lead you up.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Up to the very top of the Tree of Knowledge,</p>
          <p>to grow up, and move Mountains, and become a Great Being.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>That beautiful road and mountains beyond hold the answers,</p>

          <p>The universe is always gasping for more brilliance,</p>
          <p>and when the roads are denied or not taken, it grows darker for it.</p>

        <section>
          <p>Even your sadness,</p>
          <p>makes the universe darker.</p>

          <p>It just so happens that we have tiny flaw,</p>
          <p>we accept authority, and believe the culture we are born into.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>In a world where schools follow a curriculum that is a patchwork,</p>
          <p>of political promises, and lowest common denominator garbage meant to easily test progress.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>We fall in to the rabbit hole,</p>
          <p>we become indoctrinated into the belief that education is not our own path,</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>But a hodge-podge of trinkets,</p>
          <p>that we must toil and moil to unpack to try to make some sense of.</p>

        <section>
          <p>It is possible to follow your own path,</p>
          <p>and then come back to school and come out with a perfect grade.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>But doing this also adds legitimacy to a very sick system,</p>
          <p>that removes people natural predisposition for beauty to replace it with a mere impression of knowledge.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Many will wholly reject the fact that schools are broken,</p>
          <p>because it is all they knew.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Heartbreakingly, they will hold up a beautiful book by a beloved Science Popularizer,</p>
          <p>and laugh at how it left out at all the things that they have memorized in class.</p>

        <section>
          <p>But Knowledge is not about recalling all the facts,</p>
          <p>be it by memorization or mnemonic.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Knowledge, is about synthesizing new observations, new ideas, new challenges,</p>
          <p>from magnificent conjecture to newly discovered brilliant theories, formulas, facts, and inventions.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And, not at some abstract point, post graduation which after all a mere piece of paper,</p>
          <p>but the genesis of new ideas from the moment you finish reading your fifth book on a subject you like.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>The way you progress through your labyrinth of discovery, and that path through the tree of knowledge, is baby step at a time,</p>
          <p>sometimes you&apos;ll discover something that will take you left, sometimes right, but you will always move upwards, always growing up.</p>

          <p>Your path must be a sequence of steps that make sense to you,</p>
          <p>pleasant answers to your curiosities.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Your path is deeply personal,</p>
          <p>it helps your mind to grow Strong and Healthy.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Standardized education, is so mixed up that it is best memorized,</p>
          <p>but memorization can only be temporary, it is not helpful in ideas synthesis, it is only helpful for actors and pretenders.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Schools are a recent invention, and it was a lot worse before, but now we need more,</p>
          <p>a clearer, more personalized, more honest, more loving schools, that help to guide people towards Wisdom and Knowledge.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <hr>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>But to achieve that dream, we must take responsibility for our own education first,</p>
          <p>only then will we know how to build the next generation of schools.</p>
