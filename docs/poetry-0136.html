          <p>Of course,</p>
          <p>let us ask what their regrets are...</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>We are after all the future generation,</p>
          <p>to those that came before us.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Therefore we have insight,</p>
          <p>and certainly have regrets.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>We regret;</p>
          <p>wars, poverty, hate and stupidity.</p>

        <section>
          <p>We want World Peace,</p>
          <p>because a single Human Life is more Sacred than all the gods put together,</p>
          <p>because borders are stupid and war is hell,</p>
          <p>because ongoing weapons manufacturing is evil.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>We want the End of Poverty,</p>
          <p>because money should only be used to help a person and not make them worse,</p>
          <p>because no one should be denied mental, dental or medical care,</p>
          <p>because not a single Human Being should ever go hungry or thirsty.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>We want the Age of Wisdom,</p>
          <p>because people must learn how to think before being told what to think,</p>
          <p>because the Modern Human being must first catch up with Knowledge in Beloved Books,</p>
          <p>because we must put an end to making mistakes that can otherwise be avoided.</p>

        <section>
          <p>The World will not grow if People are too scared, or too hungry, or too tired to learn.</p>

        <section>
          <p>The World will not grow, if You, and I, and Everybody Else fails to Honor the Future Generations.</p>

          <p>As many evil forces as there are,</p>
          <p>they will give up the moment they see that their lies can&apos;t move crowds anymore.</p>

        <section>
          <p>We can&apos;t be sure if this document exist yet,</p>
          <p>perhaps you will begin writing it,</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>perhaps your article will be the opening article,</p>

          <p>There are to many borders, My Friends,</p>
          <p>and too often money is being used for harm, where it was invented for good.</p>

        <section>
          <p>Our World, with Our Love and Our Blessing,</p>
          <p>must take another Deep and Long Breath,</p>
          <p>and Exhale in Blooming Changes all around.</p>

          <p>Practice, take out your journal, and scribble to no end,</p>
          <p>many high and mighty laws printed over and over on paper will not hold up forever.</p>

        <section>
          <p>Humanity never moved toward some Economic Paradise,</p>
          <p>it has always moved towards Goodness and Love.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>It has moved slowly, slowed down by poverty of so many,</p>
          <p>slowed down by borders,</p>
          <p>and people not yet ready to learn how to think before they are told what to think.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>But it has moved with unlimited strength,</p>
          <p>sanding down to dust all that stood in the path of Good Ideas, and Goodness, and Love.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Do not accept wrongs, on paper, or law, or the red faces of those moving against the grain of reality,</p>
          <p>do not assume that the wrongs that stand today, will not be erased tomorrow.</p>
