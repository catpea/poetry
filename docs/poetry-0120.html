          <p>Anything that can go wrong may go wrong,</p>
          <p>and there is only one guarantee in life.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>It is a guarantee, precisely because it is within our complete control,</p>
          <p>the guarantee is The Greatness Of Our Soul, or Spirit, or Being.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>It means you will keep getting up no matter how many times you fall,</p>
          <p>it means you will continue moving forward without stopping.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>It means there is no pain, it means there is no weakness,</p>
          <p>that it is a function and fact of life that we advance forward.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And on the day of triumph,</p>
          <p>it means that the prize is nothing less than Laughter and Joy of Life.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>The Greatness of Our Soul, our single guarantee in life,</p>
          <p>may begin in discomfort, but it concludes with something <strong>far</strong> more.</p>

          <p>Marvels of the Human Spirit that we can&apos;t directly conjure up within ourselves,</p>
