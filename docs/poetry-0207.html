          <p>Just like we are vulnerable,</p>
          <p>to listening to authority without question.</p>

          <p>A paper book is a very desperate attempt and hope,</p>
          <p>to share a deeply personal treasure.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>A novel is often times a hidden way to say something,</p>
          <p>something that authors don&apos;t want to take personal responsibility for.</p>

          <p>I am sure there used to be professional readers,</p>
          <p>that would come to a wealthy persons house and beautifully recite a book.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>But once we were able to record a book,</p>

          <p>Personal Note,</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Due to the way copyright laws work there are many beautiful books in the Public Domain,</p>
          <p>if you were to challenge yourself to voice certain books in the most beautiful of ways,</p>
          <p>I am sure people from all around the world would love you for it.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>
            Some books that that come to mind are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditations" target="_blank">Meditations by Marcus Aurelius</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_War">The Art of War by Sun Tzu</a> and
            of course <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagakure">Hagakure by Yamamoto Tsunetomo</a>.
          </p>

        <section>
          <p>Also, keep in mind what a wonderful treasure recordings you made in your youth become as time flows,</p>
          <p>what great inheritance to the children of the future to hear their Grand-grand-grand-grand Grandma,</p>
          <p>reading Jack London, Leo Tolstoy, Herman Melville, H. G. Wells, Mark Twain, Mary Shelley, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.</p>

          <p>...And uhh... you know, (and this is just between you and me),</p>
          <p>you could uhh... spice up the slower, dryer parts of said books.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>You know, mistakes happen, you could for example mix up Mary Shelley&apos;s Frankenstein</p>
          <p>with H. G. Wells&apos; Time Machine, and add a sprinkle or two of The Whale by Herman Melville,</p>
          <p>and tie it all together with some sweet romantic story from your own wonderful life.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>I assure you with all my heart,</p>
          <p>it will only make your art of reading,</p>
          <p>that much more fascinating.</p>
