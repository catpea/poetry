        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Tiniest poems are by far best,</p>
          <p>but writing short stories is a real test.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Be warned, whatever you do not create a poem that is angry or sad,</p>
          <p>as people search for poems to get away from all the bad.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The first step is to get a hold of a list of words that rhyme,</p>
          <p>a rhyming dictionary, or just search for a rhyming website.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The thing about finding rhymes is that you don&apos;t always get to say,</p>
          <p>what you are trying to say, so you have to expand or contract, till you find a rhyme.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>There are many types of poems,</p>
          <p>but little rhyming ones are always cheerful and loving.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And because you can only say what rhymes,</p>
          <p>you get to include extras, that you wouldn&apos;t normally think of.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>For example,</p>
          <p>here is a little poem about strange mini-adventures.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>There is something lovely and strange,</p>
          <p>when going out for a jog or a walk for a change.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If it is early morning and before the sun comes out,</p>
          <p>it will be a fascinating workout.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>If it is late at night,</p>
          <p>it will feel like running at the speed of light.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And just going our for a walk is also great,</p>
          <p>because it is a heck of a way to concentrate.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I think of poems as little dreams,</p>
          <p>they just meander their own way, and that is OK.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I prefer writing two lines,</p>
          <p>where both of the endings rhyme.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Some people like an even odd scheme,</p>
          <p>where first rhymes with third, and second with fourth.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And sometimes people pay attention to the rhythm of the line it self,</p>
          <p>that can be very good practice for song making.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>By far the best method in my opinion,</p>
          <p>is to write on a commuter.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Because here you can easily edit lines,</p>
          <p>and quickly look up rhymes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But, you should also keep a paper journal,</p>
          <p>where you write down your favorite poems, and rhymes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And above all, and this is really, really important,</p>
          <p>you have to record your voice, or make a video of you reading your poems.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Recording your recitations truly is a huge part or poetry,</p>
          <p>you can just cover the camera if you are uncomfortable with full video.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Lets try another poem,</p>
          <p>this one is about boo boo, a barking dog I often say hello to during my spring jogs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Though I love the singing birds and frogs,</p>
          <p>I don&apos;t really make many friends on my jogs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But there is this one dog that really barks,</p>
          <p>I always mutter, ah-a! a bite like that will leave some marks.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But as soon as I speed up with a frown,</p>
          <p>he seems to somewhat, calm down.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I think he barks because he is bored,</p>
          <p>and as far as strangers go his barks often go ignored.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And here I come breathlessly chugging along,</p>
          <p>sometimes doing little dances to my song.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And I think he barks because that entertains him,</p>
          <p>that I try so hard to be slim.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I try to show him I am a gentleman and I wave,</p>
          <p>in hopes that he does not misbehave.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And, I gave him a name too,</p>
          <p>I call him Boo-Boo.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>After what I&apos;d probably get if he got his wish,</p>
          <p>and got off of his leash.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Even, the tiniest idea can become a funny and somewhat lengthy poem,</p>
          <p>as you go round an round searching for rhymes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Poems can be really good at helping you remember something neat,</p>
          <p>like the sound that frogs made one day, or a barking dog.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Without trying to rhyme,</p>
          <p>the story would be one sentence long, and soon forgotten.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>With a poem,</p>
          <p>it just keeps going bark and bark.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I should also mention,</p>
          <p>that there is this classy way of speaking about things, by subtle analogy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Instead of writing a poem that mentions your favorite philosophers,</p>
          <p>mention flower names, or planets, or star names instead.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And as a result you end up with a book of poetry,</p>
          <p>about something seemingly ordinary, but also one that hides a profound wisdom.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>For example, Philosophers are fond or saying,</p>
          <p>&quot;Education is the kindling of a flame, not the filling of a vessel&quot;.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Aster, is a kind of flower that symbolizes,</p>
          <p>Wisdom, Faith, and Valor, and the word comes from Greek and means star.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The word planets also has its roots in the greek plan&#x113;tes asteres,</p>
          <p>meaning &quot;wandering stars&quot; and in this case, a wandering student.</p>
          <p>PLANETS ASTER</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Even if a person is not familiar with what the analogies are about,</p>
          <p>they are sure to appreciate a mysterious poem and completely understand it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Too many planets and stars,</p>
          <p>and no Aster could ever stand up to vengeful Mars.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>We mustn&apos;t hope to fill the vessel but to kindle a flame,</p>
          <p>we can only hope to give the stars an aim.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>May the stars and the wanderers find their light,</p>
          <p>so that our world can grow, more noble and bright.</p>
