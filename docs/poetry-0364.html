        <div class="section">
          <p>Let us define some things up front:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Teaching, or being taught, is when someone else is trying to make you learn.</p>
          <p>Learning, is when you your self reach out for knowledge.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Studying, means looking at something up close.</p>
          <p>Studying for an exam, is code for memorization.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Memorization in context of standardized education,</p>
          <p>is gaining a temporary ability to mindlessly recall some facts for a matching test.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Before I learned English I memorized the opening speech in Star Trek TNG,</p>
          <p>and the theme song to Cheers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The way I did this was to write down the sounds I heard in the speech,</p>
          <p>in my own native language like this:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>&quot;Dis ar de vojadzes ov startrek enterprys&quot;,</p>
          <p>I knew what the speech was about, but I wasn&apos;t able to match up the words quite yet.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>At 16 or so, I wouldn&apos;t know how to write it down,</p>
          <p>in away that I could get it right.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>What ultimately helped me learn English was cartoons and closed captions,</p>
          <p>and above all moving to America, I had a reason, I had a want, I had a passion for English.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The only thing that didn&apos;t help me learn English was Shakespeare,</p>
          <p>which I tried to read because everyone said it was English.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Though I struggled with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHoaPLO6Zd8">Balcony Scene</a> in Romeo and Juliet,</p>
          <p>I also fell in love with it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I memorized a lot of quotes from the back of the book,</p>
          <p>they just roll of my tongue to this day.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Learning, requires that you have a need to learn something,</p>
          <p>Memorizing, has nothing to do with learning, it is all about acting.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Yes, I am able to recite the speech from Star Trek in real English,</p>
          <p>even though I learned it as babble and gibberish, but that is the most horrible way to learn to recite something from memory, it is a joke.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>To learn something, means to have enough connecting fiber to know it without mnemonics or tricks,</p>
          <p>to learn something requires the involvement of a kind of love.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>A good example of that kind of love is coming to country that you always wanted to live in,</p>
          <p>and absorbing things, you don&apos;t memorize, memorization is thin, hollow, temporary, easily damaged or warped.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I never sat down to memorize English words,</p>
          <p>I just had this massive overwhelming urge to understand what the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNBl-dsgNfg">Ninja Turtles</a> were talking about.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I wanted to be in on their jokes, once I learned to separate what I was hearing into words,</p>
          <p>which is just a function of becoming familiar with the language.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I found the words most frequently used were indicative of structure,</p>
          <p>and the meaning was found in the context.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Context is something you get out of what has been happening in the cartoon,</p>
          <p>where you think the cartoon is going, where it usually goes, what characters usually do, and what you understood thus far.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I only recently learned that the opening intro says &quot;heroes in a half shell&quot;,</p>
          <p>I always heard it as &quot;hap shell&quot; (H.A.P.) and because I wasn&apos;t used to hearing that elsewhere, I assumed the word is just mangled.</p>
          <p>(I was familiar with word half and shell back when watching the cartoons, but I still think half shell is a pretty odd way of describing something dome shaped.)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It was a big deal for me to find something from Ninja Turtles,</p>
          <p>in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euWrpl2y3Mo">Inspector Gadget</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klu9Lmau08g">The DJ Kat Show</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>For those of you who think it is crazy or silly to learn from cartoons,</p>
          <p>take a look at one of the better alternatives: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGiNjI1j2P4" title="Follow Me, the tougher way of learning English">Follow Me - Beginner, Part 1</a></p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>I won&apos;t mention text books here,</p>
          <p>as they aren&apos;t useful at all, six months of closed captions is all it takes to get to story books.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>To end this note, I wanted to mention Audio Books,</p>
          <p>at a certain point, sooner than later, books like Top 100 Poems, and anything by Bill Bryson, take care of the rest.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>So as long as the person is learning at their own pace everything will work out,</p>
          <p>but to force someone to learn faster, is very cruel, and may put an end to that person&apos;s delicate curiosities.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Making them feel stupid for learning at their own pace by grading them down,</p>
          <p>will probably cause great and long lasting harm to their self esteem and interests.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Forcing children to learn within time constraints,</p>
          <p>and punishing them for failure, will only force them into temporary memorization as a way of protecting themselves.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Unethical schools will exploit that to their advantage,</p>
          <p>they will keep the kids stressed out and purposefully force them into meaningless memorization so that everyone gets paid.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>There is a concept of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYpK7nE2Pbo">Elaborative Rehearsal</a> that somewhat shines some light on this cruelty,</p>
          <p>when contrasted with the notion of a Maintenance Rehearsal.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But even Elaborative Rehearsal does not come close what it means to Actually Really Learn,</p>
          <p>a person can only learn or as we should call it soak up, inhale, integrate new knowledge, when they are moving along a path that is of great interest to them.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>That means, people can only really learn what they are interested in,</p>
          <p>and will not learn if they are taught in segments by teachers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is difficult to believe that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxyKNMrhEvY">schools do not work</a>,</p>
          <p>it maybe impossible for many to believe they are an insult to the younger generations.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>To make headway in this discussion, we must resist speaking in the bare abstract terms,</p>
          <p>we must only speak in terms of specific subjects (like Math), or areas like (Science), and focus on reproducible results.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>A child that learns mathematics for real will end up creating computer game engines,</p>
          <p>visualization frameworks, computer games, generative graphics, and even generative music.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>A child that is taught mathematics, will only learn to recall few of the most popular formulas,</p>
          <p>later on in life, in a discussion about learning math, they will be ashamed of having only memorized formulas (in the goodness of their hearts they will still not blame schools).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>This interest in making formulas come to life, with computers can be short lived,</p>
          <p>in which case the person is likely to take to electronics, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L72D_wEM3NU">programming machines to take their art outside</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Mathematics as it is taught in school, will be disabling to most students,</p>
          <p>and the result of that is they they will not look into programming, they won&apos;t want to take their art outside, and a whole world will be denied to them.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=raspberry+pi+projects">math taught in school is cutting people off from a whole world of sweet curiosities</a>,</p>
          <p>this has been going on for so long, that we can only be speechless...</p>
