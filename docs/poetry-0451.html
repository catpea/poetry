          <p>That is what innovation is all about,</p>
          <p>the secret, is out.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Poking at some things for a while,</p>
          <p>will help you out-compete competition by a mile.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But pay attention to the poetry of the thing,</p>
          <p>set your aims aside and don&apos;t cling.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You invent by combining pieces that _already_ fit together,</p>
          <p>your invention has to be light as a feather.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It is meant to lift you out,</p>
          <p>so you don&apos;t have to work as hard as a trout.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Every one of us is an inventor at heart,</p>
          <p>and we are all very smart.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>In fact... there isn&apos;t a person that is smarter than you!</p>
          <p>invention is a function of a breakthrough.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>You just have to grab onto the things you like,</p>
          <p>and take them with you on a loooooooong hike.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>And just let them fit together naturally until they click,</p>
          <p>and you&apos;ll have your new invention very quick.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>But you have to think about it, and be rested, and relax,</p>
          <p>that when your mind will purr to the max.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Yeah, don&apos;t let your self think that inventors are super smart,</p>
          <p>inventing is just another form of art.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>It takes a little bit of practice, but not _too_ much,</p>
          <p>it is not about superpowers or some such.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Find a bunch of things that you like,</p>
          <p>go on a hike, or ride your bike, and wait for the new idea to strike.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>Even something as simple as a colorful wide-rubber-band,</p>
          <p>can become a new class of wallet that will hold phone. remote, car keys and cards in a tight package that will fit your hand.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <p>There is absolutely no limit to what you can invent,</p>
          <p>but you must let go of the original intent.</p>
