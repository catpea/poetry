        <section>
          <p>Days pass by quickly, but as all the clocks tick away,</p>
          <p>we mustn&apos;t keep our minds at bay.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>We each have extraordinary powers,</p>
          <p>and we can expand our knowledge,</p>
          <p>in just a few hours.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>All it takes is a video lecture,</p>
          <p>or maybe an audio-book,</p>
          <p>you don&apos;t even have to look.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Hours add up, day by day,</p>
          <p>building, a new passageway.</p>
          <p>It is knowledge that sets us free.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And our inheritance from great beings,</p>
          <p>is the key.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>We mustn&apos;t forget, that everyone needs to learn,</p>
          <p>not merely listen, but break out of their prison,</p>
          <p>and rise to greatness, when theirs is the turn.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>It is within us, that each great being should return,</p>
          <p>it is how the world grows, it is how you get your turn.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>So, rise to their height, inherit their might,</p>
          <p>shine the brightest of light,</p>
          <p>yours is the future, yours is the fight.</p>
