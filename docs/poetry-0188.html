          <p>Let the deans nod to the graduates that drink most coffee,</p>
          <p>sitting with presidents and dignitaries,</p>
          <p>let them smile that each passed their trial.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>But you, Dear Mother, you take your child to the Library,</p>
          <p>make it their Castle, make it their Home,</p>
          <p>make it their Temple of Knowledge.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>&quot;My Mother used to bring me here almost every day,</p>
          <p>this is my Temple of Knowledge, this is my Forever Home.&quot;</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Teach that non-fiction, especially Memoirs,</p>
          <p>are the only safe way to grow up.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Keep them on a path to understanding of the simplest things first,</p>
          <p>and the most important things second so that they may build an easy on-ramp for themselves.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Remind them, that all young mistakes have already been made countless times,</p>
          <p>that all the lessons, answers, and hopes of prevention,</p>
          <p>are to be found in sacred stories of Triumph and Disaster.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>That there is little in blind following.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>And that there is Everything in pursuit of Wisdom,</p>
          <p>to join with the Greater Family of the Great Human Beings,</p>
          <p>that came before us and are sure to follow.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>That school is just a Dream,</p>
          <p>of a Simpler Universe,</p>
          <p>a melody sweetly played,</p>
          <p>but not in tune.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>That our mind at its most responsible,</p>
          <p>is the Sole Institution that we require,</p>
          <p>for Pursuits of Excellence and Higher Learning.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>So as long as we love ourselves,</p>
          <p>as long as we are compassionate to ourselves,</p>
          <p>we can comprehend inside out, many times the knowledge,</p>
          <p>of those who are taught, outside in.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Let the Temple of Knowledge,</p>
          <p>shine its beacon and sound the bell,</p>
          <p>each time the little ones need answers,</p>
          <p>and each time they are ready to commit their own wisdom to History.</p>

        <section>
          <p>World Peace requires,</p>
          <p>that each child today,</p>
          <p>becomes a Great Being,</p>
          <p>in the Greater Tomorrow.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>World Peace has little to do with the unobtainable ceasefire today,</p>
          <p>and has everything to do, with letting children grow up under blue skies,</p>
          <p>without drone strikes, deafening echoes of explosions, bullet riddled walls, and detention camps.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>May the Greatness of Your Vision, and Unbreakability of your Heart and Mind,</p>
          <p>help the Unstoppable Children of today, become the Great Beings the Future Needs.</p>
