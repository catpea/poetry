I woke up at five,
and I felt alive.

I left at five forty two,
I could still smell the dew.

The sun was still down,
and the clouds looked brown.


But I ran,
like Superman.

I had weights in each hand,
ready to conquer Westland.



Though by the time I got to Central City,
I felt just about as strong as a little kitty.

But I kept going,
and the sky started glowing.

It was really pretty,
- the sunrise finally came to the city.

There was a cloud or two,
but that only added to the view.



I ran much faster, like I had superpowers,
and made the six miles under two hours.

It is my best time thus far,
and I felt like a superstar.

But, I have a lot more training to do,
...though I must say, I already grew.



I love how I am making proggres jooging
and bodybuilding and blogging...

...and all at the same time,
that sure is a lot of pictures and rhyme.
