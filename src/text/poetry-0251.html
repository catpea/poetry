    <section>
      <p>Books and Audio Books,</p>
      <p>are as important to us as food.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>But many of us can't get into them,</p>
      <p>and there is a reason why.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Many lives are lived at a speed,</p>
      <p>that makes books hard to follow and understand.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>We lead busy lives,</p>
      <p>and majority of our time is spent in haste.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Haste brings us relief from,</p>
      <p>anxieties and confusing questions.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Part of the reason why haste,</p>
      <p>brings us relief.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Is that there is less time,</p>
      <p>to be bothered with things we don't understand.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>This is the reason why many people, come their golden age,</p>
      <p>feel, that life was a lot shorter than they expected.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>In a word, haste blocks us,</p>
      <p>from experiencing our lives in full.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Books hold all the answers that will address anxiety and confusion,</p>
      <p>but they require that the person exists the state of haste to understand them.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>As we read, comprehend, and inherit more and more,</p>
      <p>we'll hold enough answers to learn to live without the need for haste.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>To slam the breaks,</p>
      <p>we need a change of scenery.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Section hiking Appalachian, of the Pacific Crest Trail,</p>
      <p>comes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPSvdKTEZug">highly recommended</a> by many great beings.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>But any kind of long adventure,</p>
      <p>where you have to go to sleep come sundown, will do.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Even before you decide where you are headed,</p>
      <p>even before you get your backpack out.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>You will be able to see,</p>
      <p>how easy it will be to absorb your audio books as you walk through the woods.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Both your body and your mind,</p>
      <p>will begin transforming.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>What was once "just moss",</p>
      <p>will not become a precious sunlit dew world.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Fern will now paint the world around you, perfectly hiding beautiful secret springs,</p>
      <p>little furry creatures, damn angry bears, and other woodland treasures.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>At twilight you will have to go to sleep,</p>
      <p>you'll awaken full of energy just before sunrise.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The scent of a green morning,</p>
      <p>the sound of nature.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And then the books will start calling you,</p>
      <p>maybe it will be "A Walk In The Woods" by Bill Bryson.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Or it could be "The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark".</p>
      <p>by Carl Sagan, or "The Partly Cloudy Patriot" read in Sarah Vowell's amazing voice.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>It will be nice, and relaxing,</p>
      <p>it will be impossible to put down.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And then,</p>
      <p>something you didn't expect will happen.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>See, whatever your next big step in your life,</p>
      <p>that internal transformation that your soul is ready to leap to...</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>It has already been described,</p>
      <p>with Love and Passion in a book somewhere.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Within the first ten books you are bound to find,</p>
      <p>the first one that deeply will move you.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>It will connect with you, extend you,</p>
      <p>integrate with you, help you leap forward in your development.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Within days you won't even be able to remember,</p>
      <p>what came from the book and what was already in you.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>It will change everything,</p>
      <p>it will restore you completely.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And so your search for the next life-chaining book,</p>
      <p>and the next adventure, will begin.</p>
