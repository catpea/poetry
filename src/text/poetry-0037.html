      <p>Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Thirty Two,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I thought about my bicycle, my trail,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>the morning dew.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>When there is no gym,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I get up real early,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>and ride on through,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>It is magical out there,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>seeing the world from the other side,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>people stuck in traffic,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>and here I ride.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I discovered modern architecture</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>of the highway underpass,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>little woodland parks,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>endless fields of grass.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Five miles out,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>there lives an angry goose,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>at seven miles,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>in deep summer, angry 'squitoes on the loose,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Ten miles out,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>there is a ninety degree turn,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>and emptiness follows,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>nothing but deep green fern.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Fifteen miles out,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>a whole new city,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>two new parks,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>and the road gets gritty.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>At twenty miles,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>the real adventure starts,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>you better have water,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>and some street smarts.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And if you keep going forward,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>you'll arrive on a pier at Lake Erie.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>At first you'll feel pretty weary,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>until you realize you're 30 miles from your bed,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>at which point things will get pretty mad.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Hope you have trailmix.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Cause you're gonna need it.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>To find you way back.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>and keep pushing those pedals.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>It will get dark soon,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>but upon your return,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>you'll fall into your comfy bed,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>with a long, dramatic swoon,</p>
    </section>
