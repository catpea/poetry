      <p>The educational shortcut,</p>
      <p>is always a lie.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The only thing we will find in a shortcut,</p>
      <p>is a fantasy or fairy tale, an impression of education, or make-believe success.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>There is really no need to take shortcuts in life,</p>
      <p>learning and growing up is beautiful.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Growing up, is an act of endless tiny adventures,</p>
      <p>as you pursue your little curiosities onward to wisdom.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Most adventures are very poetic, adventures in spirit so to speak,</p>
      <p>such as learning to paint low-brow art with oil on canvas, whilst listening to Kenji Kawai.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Many adventures are actual expeditions that involve backpacks and sometimes even tents,</p>
      <p>it still counts, when you only camp in your backyard; an adventure is an adventure.</p>

    <section>
      <p>The more advanced art of listening to audio books when hiking through a little wilderness,</p>
      <p>is so pleasant, so relaxing and educational that no one should want to skip it.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>When books are read to us,</p>
      <p>we really connect with what the author is saying.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Reading books with our own inner-voice, is not perfect because we bring in our own worries and tone,</p>
      <p>the book is always tethered down with what is going on in our life and what comes tomorrow.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Books are stories that must be told with passion,</p>
      <p>and by an external voice, with some approval from the author; if not the author her self.</p>
    </section>

    <section>

    <section>
      <p>It is not possible to walk through the woods, and sticks and roots,</p>
      <p>and read a book in such a way that we can hear the author try to teach us wisdom.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Yes, it is important that we walk through green valleys and fragrant woodlands,</p>
      <p>it is not the same to listen to a book in the busy streets of a city full of strangers.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Nature has a very powerful impact on us,</p>
      <p>it makes us slow down, it makes us calmer, we sleep at sunset and awake at sun rise.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Without fears, distractions, and the hurry of the busy life,</p>
      <p>books begin fitting into our lifestyle as our heart begins to call for wisdom.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Nature and Books are opposite of shortcuts, they</p>
      <p>create very long and wise lives.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>This is a lifestyle of learning and growing up,</p>
      <p>it cannot hurt us, it can only make us better, and it will spare us mistakes.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>In this kind of life,</p>
      <p>no one will push you to hurry up.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>No one will frighten you, or lie to you,</p>
      <p>here you just cheerfully move at your own speed.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Always thinking,</p>
      <p>and always learning, always growing up.</p>

    <section>
      <p>In the life that we are all expected to live,</p>
      <p>people lie when they say college will grant you a successful career.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Only you can guarantee yourself a successful career,</p>
      <p>and you have to start very early, maybe as early as middle-school.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>You have to begin thinking about co-founding a series of tiny companies</p>
      <p>that will help you learn about business, and what it means to be a leader, a founder, and a CEO.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>You have to discover and follow your passions,</p>
      <p>and further your inventions.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Real investors don't care much for a sales pitch with an elevator cartoon,</p>
      <p>they look for genius, passion, sanity, and long therm visions.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>On the other hand working for somebody else under several management layers,</p>
      <p>does not guarantee a healthy career.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>We maybe forced into stress, overwork,</p>
      <p>and have all our balance drained from us.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Just because we can work at a breakneck speed,</p>
      <p>it does not mean that we should, that kind of lifestyle is very dangerous.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Servitude of this kind will make us age faster,</p>
      <p>long after the bosses tried to tell us "life is not fair" we will still suffer from effects of overwork.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>We must keep a healthy balance with day and night and nature,</p>
      <p>we are not machines, we are poetry.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>There are no shortcuts,</p>
      <p>and learning is beautiful.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>For one you never stop learning, and two; life never stops challenging you,</p>
      <p>and three, you must live healthy.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Take good care of your self,</p>
      <p>it is the lifetimes of wisdom you inherit from all the books that makes the biggest difference.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Life is meant to be lived beautifully and cheerfully;</p>
      <p>consciousness is such an impossible gift from the Universe, that without a doubt, you are meant to be happy.</p>
