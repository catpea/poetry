      <p>It is not "the secret to happiness",</p>
      <p>it is that happiness; is the secret.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>happiness is the true human superpower.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Sure, we can push through anything,</p>
      <p>and adapt to everything.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>But, in happiness,</p>
      <p>our might multiples to no end.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And happiness can't be faked,</p>
      <p>happiness depends on authenticity.</p>

    <section>
      <p>I think it is the key to learning,</p>
      <p>adventuring, exploring, and discovering.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>It is the key to invention, to creativity,</p>
      <p>to becoming a force of nature.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Happiness puts us up,</p>
      <p>on the highest of levels of existence.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Right up there with distant supernoveae,</p>
      <p>quasars, neutron stars, and stellar nurseries.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>On par with the Universe,</p>
      <p>contributing something the quarks and quasars can't.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I am certain, we only have one flaw,</p>
      <p>just a small stupid mistake</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>One that that can be easily avoided,</p>
      <p>so as long as we remind each other about it.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>We accept what we are born into as a standard,</p>
      <p>and along with it we accepts the false leaders as well.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>If the culture and its leaders are headed for a black hole,</p>
      <p>we have an overwhelming tendency to blindly follow.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>We have to grab each other, with Art, Music, Poetry,</p>
      <p>with Doodles and Graffiti, Hugging, Shouting, and Howling.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Grab each other by the ears and whisper,</p>
      <p>whilst gently rocking the head in every direction.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>"Do not go gentle into that good night,</p>
      <p>rage, rage, against the dying of light."</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And when we snap out of that gravitational pull,</p>
      <p>we must begin our journey up, all the way up.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Nobody knows,</p>
      <p>what comes first.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Healing, Leadership.</p>
      <p>Love of Live, Joy of Being,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Love, Happiness, Wisdom,</p>
      <p>Greatness, Enlightenment.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Authenticity, Dignity, Nobility,</p>
      <p>Courage, Valor, Honor, Heroism.</p>

      <p>Creativity, Invention,</p>
      <p>Dance and Rebellion.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I suppose no one knows which comes first because it all comes at once,</p>
      <p>all of those marvels are one, indivisible, part of Being Human.</p>

      <p>We must avoid what Dear Sir Ken Robinson refereed to as,</p>
      <p>Taking Things for Granted.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>We must avoid assuming that something is true,</p>
      <p>without thinking about it, without questioning it.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>We must resist self-indoctrination into cultures,</p>
      <p>that we are merely born into.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Only when we break away from that dark thoughtless path,</p>
      <p>will we be able to freely grow and rise up.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Only on our way up,</p>
      <p>will we find Happiness, and the other Marvels.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And although this century will be a challenging one,</p>
      <p>when we face it upright.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Enabled by the marvels that makes us Human, and on par with the universe,</p>
      <p>we will rise, and learn, and become wiser for it.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>We have lost ten tigers, in recent weeks,</p>
      <p>we are down to 3890 tigers.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The Tragedy of the Big Pussy Cats,</p>
      <p>is one way, that the universe is helping us rise.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Remember, first you must learn to resist indoctrination,</p>
      <p>resist taking things for granted, resist following leaders you don't know,</p>
      <p>resist the fallacy of choosing the lesser evil.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And second, you must take to books,</p>
      <p>self educate by falling in love with Humanity's most celebrated works.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>With each step upwards towards becoming a great being,</p>
      <p>you will gain more and more abilities.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And third, Educated Humanity,</p>
      <p>is a United Humanity.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>To repeat one of the quotes by Robert Ardrey that Sir Ken Robinson was fond of,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>"...We were born of risen apes, not fallen angels,</p>
      <p>The miracle of man is not how far he has sunk</p>
      <p>but how magnificently he has risen.</p>
      <p>We are known among the stars by our poems..."</p>
