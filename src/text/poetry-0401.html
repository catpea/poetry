    <div class="section">
      <p>Above all, all the heavy people in the word,</p>
      <p>work out a lot, year after year building muscle under all that weight.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Getting into exercise can be hard,</p>
      <p>depending how large we get.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Dieting, is complicated because we need food,</p>
      <p>it is not OK to just stop eating.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>In this little poem,</p>
      <p>I will explain how to get started.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You will need to change your daily routine,</p>
      <p>because 20, 30, maybe 40 years of your life is at stake, here.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>While it is not true, overeating does signal the you don't care about yourself,</p>
      <p>or spending those extra 20 - 40 years with your loved ones.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Let us correct this,</p>
      <p>and never look back.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>First of all and half-jokingly speaking in order to illustrate change of routine,</p>
      <p>if you can, please safely get rid of your refrigerator, stove, microwave, grill, skillet and electric skillet, pots and pans, and toaster.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>If you upset your loved ones,</p>
      <p>just tell them that this is your way of showing that you do care, and want to be around for a long looong time because you love them.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Alternatively you can buy a bunch of little luggage locks,</p>
      <p>and thread them through the holes in the plugs... and throw away the keys.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And if you tried all this already, and none of it worked,</p>
      <p>just cut off the plugs, but be very careful with your stove, it is better to get rid of the skillet, pots and pans, or call a professional to remove the stove.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I expect you will do such a thing in your imagination, or maybe unplug something,</p>
      <p>but this will immediate put you in a different world.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Because how are you going to heat up your fancy burrito,</p>
      <p>you won't, because the burrito in not a good thing, it was trying to murder you all along.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Once you take a step back, and consider how much ketchup, dressing, and salt, and pepper, you were adding to things,</p>
      <p>you will realize that the real taste of most of the foods you like it not all that good, and it gets a lot worse the more you eat.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I mean if you have to drown something in spices and condiments,</p>
      <p>it is not that tasty, plus it is trying to kill you, in multiple ways, and all of them are awful.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Food is only meant to give us energy and keep us healthy,</p>
      <p>comfort is to be found in adventure.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Big adventure,</p>
      <p>big change.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Begin walking, buy a large and comfy seat and begin riding your bicycle,</p>
      <p>and try to go out there early in the morning when it is still dark, everything smells so nice in the morning.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And set your aim on the Appalachian Trail,</p>
      <p>or the Pacific Crest Trail, whichever one is closer to you.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is that walking routine,</p>
      <p>that long trail that will help you get your weight under control.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Listen plenty of Narrated Books, and fill many a journal,</p>
      <p>and know that the prize that you reach at the end of your adventure, is extra years added to your beautiful life.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Once you had enough of the trails,</p>
      <p>begin your Couch to 5K jogging workout.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And once you are comfortably jogging at a nice pace,</p>
      <p>take to dancing, more specifically Shuffle Dancing, and from time to time with dumbbells.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The truth is,</p>
      <p>your life is very important.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Life has to be lived in a balanced way,</p>
      <p>where we don't do things that shorten our life, but quite to the contrary.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Life can get scary, but it is still worth the while,</p>
      <p>walking long trails and inventing new dance moves eventually becomes pretty silly and fun, and even beautiful.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>There is nothing more important than your health,</p>
      <p>tomorrow, maybe don't go to work, but go shopping for a nice pair of walking shoes with extra soft socks.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Make the Couch to 5K program, your friend,</p>
      <p>instead of using it to jog, use it to improve your walking distance, don't worry about running it at first, just enjoy yourself.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I think the most important piece of advice I can give is, listen to Audio Books,</p>
      <p>listen to books about marathon runners, nutrition, sugar, salt, and fat, and above all adventure books.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Year after year you will add a few extra years to your life,</p>
      <p>and year after year discover how much your muscles grew in all those years of being heavy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Be good to yourself,</p>
      <p>and when you are ready, try to help others, and inspire them to long and great adventures.</p>
    </div>
