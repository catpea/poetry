      <p>Money should not hold Humanity back,</p>

      <p>We should not tolerate broken ideas,</p>
      <p>we should reject all that propagates them.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The schools are broken,</p>
      <p>schools do not teach.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And one of the most important things for a student,</p>
      <p>must be exchange programs, each semester in a different part of the world.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I will forgo writing about the meaning of legal systems,</p>
      <p>in cities that do nothing to prevent poverty.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I won't write about Judges tolerating the difference between Fairness and Justice,</p>
      <p>and what is in the law books.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I will not mention the second part of the 13th amendment,</p>
      <p>and what that makes us.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I am not going to discuss,</p>
      <p>tolerance of poverty.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I won't write about tolerance of cults that erase curiosity,</p>
      <p>and all the things they got away with especially when no one was looking.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I will clench my teeth and won't say a word about bad teachers,</p>
      <p>and their sick curricula.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I won't speak about bad parenting,</p>
      <p>and arrogance.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I wasn't even going to talk about ineffective politics,</p>
      <p>there is actually nothing to say on that subject, ZERO!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I won't talk about hospitals turning a profit,</p>
      <p>from the sick and dying.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is hard not to talk about losing Tigers,</p>
      <p>but I can hold my tears back, I won't speak.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I won't mention the risks that have been taken with climate,</p>
      <p>pollution and plastics, deforestation, melting glaciers and ocean desolinization.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I won't speak of the Holocene extinction,</p>
      <p>but I will mention it with anger.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I won't talk about vaccine hesitancy, though like racism and crime,</p>
      <p>it is just a basic function of lack of education and the impact that toxicity of poverty has on us.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>There are many more things that I won't speak of, human right violations, ongoing slavery in wealthy nations,</p>
      <p>children in concentration camps in both US, and N.Korea looking to the moon and wondering if someone else is looking too, and can they hear their thoughts and feel their despair.</p>

      <p>I will leave it up to you to notice all those terrible things,</p>
      <p>in the noble course of your own self education, as you rise to become a grown up.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I just want you to know, that the reason why you can't understand the world,</p>
      <p>and why nobody has the answers that you need, is because nothing works.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Somethings do work sometimes,</p>
      <p>but not always, not reliably, not for everyone, not equally.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>This is not to say that the world is a bad place,</p>
      <p>but it is IN a bad place, a bad place in its history.</p>

      <p>The one thing that has been consistent, that we can be sure of,</p>
      <p>is that every day, more and more people notice more and more problems.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>This increase of awareness has been going on for thousands of years,</p>
      <p>and it cannot stop, it is just not possible.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>There cannot exist any borders or nations sick enough to stop it,</p>
      <p>we are too complex, the world is too chaotic and connected.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Each day, we notice more and more broken things,</p>
      <p>each day there are more and more people in every village and city, of every nation, noticing more and more.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is a miracle,</p>
      <p>it is incomplete, but it is a beginning it is a perfect and unerasable starting point for upcoming change.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The Global Change that will come out of nowhere,</p>
      <p>as a function of our connectedness and the rejection of broken things.</p>

      <p>When it finally happens,</p>
      <p>people, especially young people, will look back at our generations with disbelief.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>In their culture,</p>
      <p>the culture of Reason... Restraint, Dignity, Nobility, Unbreakability, Fortitude, Courage, Honor, Love;</p>
      <p>and Insight; and Foresight; and Understanding; and Authenticity; and Heroism... and Compassion and Wisdom.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The way we are today will be very unclear to them,</p>
      <p>just like we can't understand bathing once a year, or living in caves...</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>They will be born to an integrated and truly modern world,</p>
      <p>that will make ours... far too strange.</p>
