      <p>Imagine,</p>
      <p>two young people purchase a "Photos for Everyone" website similar to <a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The website costs between $12,000 - $24,000,</p>
      <p>but the only way to pay it off is by sending 10% of monthly income to the mother ship company.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>If the two entrepreneurs made $240,000 the first month,</p>
      <p>$24,000 would be sent to the mother ship and the website would be all theirs.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    <div class="section">
      <p>Photography is pretty easy,</p>
      <p>in some cases the equipment can be as simple as a smartphone with a quality camera.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The two co-founders will advertise the Telecommuting back-end in photography circles,</p>
      <p>they will call to Freelancers to come and visit the back-end and pick a project, anybody with a camera can participate.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The back-end for freelancers works very similar to Siri,</p>
      <p>there is an ongoing conversation about the bounties the user is shooting for, updates on other uses and photographs taken.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>There are also bounties for Blog Posts, News Articles, Photography Tutorials,</p>
      <p>even adding new landmarks to the list - the chat interface uses google API for translation into most languages, and there is no learning curve.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The founders will spend $1,000 on bounties for 200 landmarks scattered throughout the world,</p>
      <p>they will pay a $5 bounty for a winning photo.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Since many people may choose to photograph the The Louvre Museum in Paris,</p>
      <p>there will be a small voting competition that selects the best shot.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The winner claims the $5,</p>
      <p>plus a free upgrade to the Pro Account for 50 years, worth $5,000.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Chloë, lives in Paris,</p>
      <p>she is a rebel and could use the Pro Account as another way of advertising her Photography Magic.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>She does long exposures to capture the Milky Way in the background of her photographs,</p>
      <p>so this is an easy 4.20 euros, for her.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Nadya, from Moscow, can always use extra 380 RUB,</p>
      <p>she lives down the street from the bounty, and in no time becomes the winner.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>There are four more bounties in Russia,</p>
      <p>and another 8 within a reasonable distance by rail.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>In total she ends up collecting $65 bucks,</p>
      <p>or 5,000 rubles and the weekend long adventure pays for it self.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The response, the traffic, the free advertising,</p>
      <p>has the parents of the two young entrepreneurs invest several more thousand dollars for bounties.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And they end up with a large photography archive,</p>
      <p>and thousands of active users contribution more photos even without bounties.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And a business is born,</p>
      <p>and the website grows to sell equipment and even models for 3D printing allowing cheap camera upgrades.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It becomes a social network for photographers,</p>
      <p>investors come to see if they can multiply their money</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The mother ship gets their little $24,000,</p>
      <p>and turns right around to become one of the investors.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Bounties spike like crazy, there are now hundreds of thousands of dollars in bounties,</p>
      <p>Chloë and Nadya quit their day jobs and begin covering all the damn landmarks across Eurasia.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p><a href="https://unsplash.com/blog/unsplash-getty/">The company is acquired by Getty Images</a>,</p>
      <p>and become another successful story on the internet.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Few years down the road, the two co-founders join up with Chloë and Nadya,</p>
      <p>for a new photography challenge.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But this time it is not about landmarks,</p>
      <p>it is about Photographs that change the world.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Several of the users win a Pulitzer Prize for Photography,</p>
      <p>and the rest is history.</p>
