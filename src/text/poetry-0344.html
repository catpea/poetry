      <p>Live Beautifully,</p>
      <p>Stay Strong.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Take to Knowledge and Wisdom,</p>
      <p>and if you so choose, Greatness.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Make use of our greatest powers;</p>
      <p>Authenticity, Foresight, Insight, Unbreakability...</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And be mindful of our greatest flaw,</p>
      <p>our tendency to believe in things that we are born into.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>As it sends ripples throughout our lives,</p>
      <p>even so, we must never stop rising.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Memorization is not education, school must not cause debt,</p>
      <p>there must be no schools that are above all others, all must be equal.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Recognize that bullies are ill,</p>
      <p>and compassionately add, to the eventual end to their cycle of emergence.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>In the future, there must be no prisons as we know them today,</p>
      <p>and the world, is not to be divided by borders.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And any and all wars,</p>
      <p>must be prevented decades before they occur.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We aught to be taught,</p>
      <p>to simply grow out of indoctrination and borders.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Humanity is better than its flaws,</p>
      <p>Humanity is one family.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We are all equal, we are brothers and sisters,</p>
      <p>one family under all the stars.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Self education, its bounty and fruits of knowledge,</p>
      <p>and the capacity and eventual willingness to help others is the aim.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Before we, as One Humanity, agree to support things from our long past,</p>
      <p>we must learn to ask: "Is this hurting or helping us, is this dividing, or bringing us together?".</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>May we all live beautifully.</p>
      <p>in knowledge, wisdom, and in greatness.</p>
