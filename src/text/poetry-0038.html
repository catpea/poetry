      <p>Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Thirty Three.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Days pass by quickly, but as all the clocks tick away,</p>
      <p>we mustn't keep our minds at bay.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>We each have extraordinary powers,</p>
      <p>and we can expand our knowledge,</p>
      <p>in just a few hours.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>All it takes is a video lecture,</p>
      <p>or maybe an audio-book,</p>
      <p>you don't even have to look.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Hours add up, day by day,</p>
      <p>building, a new passageway.</p>
      <p>It is knowledge that sets us free.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>And our inheritance from great beings,</p>
      <p>is the key.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>We mustn't forget, that everyone needs to learn,</p>
      <p>not merely listen, but break out of their prison,</p>
      <p>and rise to greatness, when theirs is the turn.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>It is within us, that each great being should return,</p>
      <p>it is how the world grows, it is how you get your turn.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>So, rise to their height, inherit their might,</p>
      <p>shine the brightest of light,</p>
      <p>yours is the future, yours is the fight.</p>
