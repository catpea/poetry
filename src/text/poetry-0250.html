    <section>
      <p>The only thing that divides Humanity,</p>
      <p>is levels of education.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The more educated we become,</p>
      <p>the closer we come together.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>With real education,</p>
      <p>comes wisdom.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Humanity is destined,</p>
      <p>to come together in Wisdom and Peace.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>To hasten our Convergence on Wisdom,</p>
      <p>we must accept the responsibility for our own education.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>We are each perfectly unique,</p>
      <p>there is no such thing as a standard human mind.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>We must choose our own books the books we enjoy,</p>
      <p>and walk the path that fits us best book by book, at just the right pace.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>A book is a stored wisdom,</p>
      <p>where our body needs food our mind needs books.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Books accelerate our intellectual development,</p>
      <p>books are inherited best when read by a fine narrator.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>It will take a hundred books to find the ten we need,</p>
      <p>and poetically speaking our mind will merge with their wisdom.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>We will become wiser, more compassionate,</p>
      <p>more authentic, stronger, calmer and more creative.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>While looking at ourselves we see the common Humanity,</p>
      <p>we are more than that.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>When the younger generations look at us,</p>
      <p>we are a call to Enlightenment, to Inspiration, and Knowledge and Wisdom.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Who we are,</p>
      <p>is where all the world's children follow.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Let us delay no more,</p>
      <p>and take to books right now.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Let us help those who have difficulty reading,</p>
      <p>by helping them to narrated versions.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And let us not forget,</p>
      <p>that Greatness calls to All Beings.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Therefore, let us all become Wise and Great,</p>
      <p>so that the Younger Generations may follow.</p>
