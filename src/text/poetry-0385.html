      <p>I knew today was special somehow,</p>
      <p>so I got out of my bed with a high brow.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Still a little woozy from a good night's sleep,</p>
      <p>I skipped over to my computers in a single leap.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    <div class="section">
      <p>I turned on Bach's famous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1prweT95Mo0">Prélude from the Cello Suite No. 1</a>,</p>
      <p>with Yo-Yo Ma performing it was a lot of fun.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>At 1:51 in the video the Prélude began speaking about drums to me,</p>
      <p>it calls to a drum and some sticks from a tree.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I closed my eyes and muttered "How curious",</p>
      <p>I hope this won't make Bach furious...</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Because I can rebuild hos song,</p>
      <p>and it won't even take very long.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I left that project for another day,</p>
      <p>but as learning goes, rebuilding songs is the way.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    <div class="section">
      <p>My computer popped up an update,</p>
      <p>one I had to install meow, it couldn't wait.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And then I squeaked, Holly molly batman,</p>
      <p>the Raspberry PI has an option to control the fan.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I moved the wires on the GPIO header,</p>
      <p>and the fan started working a lot better.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Now the fan only turns on when it hits 70C,</p>
      <p>my Raspberry PI is now as quiet as me.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Then I pondered the old computers some more,</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tc4ROCJYbm0">how simple the commands were in the days of yore</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tc4ROCJYbm0&t=362s">6:02</a> Brian Kernighan of the UNIX and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language">K&R</a> fame,</p>
      <p>describes the original aim.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And I thought to myself, we all understand,</p>
      <p>we just need to set our foot in the computer land.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We just need an <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-400/?variant=raspberry-pi-400-us-kit">inexpensive Unix or Linux machine</a>,</p>
      <p>with a nice and wide screen.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I pondered Node.js too,</p>
      <p><a href="https://github.com/substack/stream-handbook">node streams flow just like UNIX commands do</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And finally I put my shoes on as not to spend the whole day here,</p>
      <p>and bought another bag of ghost pepper chips, they burned from my nose to the ear.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Days like this may seem uneventful,</p>
      <p>but this is what we end up withing for when life becomes a handful.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>This was a magical Equinox and a spicy Equinox Eve,</p>
      <p>this is what they mean when people say appreciate the little things - I believe.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And somehow all my neighborhood conspired to to fire up their fireplaces one last time,</p>
      <p>the air smells so good it is hard to rhyme.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>There is no doubt that we are all genius level smart,</p>
      <p>and lives must be lived as if they were precious works of art.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Do not let troublemakers, schools, or work get in your way,</p>
      <p>we should treat each day, as if it was a special holiday.</p>
    </div>
