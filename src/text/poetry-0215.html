    <section>
      <p>I have searched for great beings,</p>
      <p>because I wanted to learn about life.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And I found them,</p>
      <p>they are not even rare.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Many are outspoken,</p>
      <p>and all over the internet.</p>
    </section>

    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Though, far greater in person,</p>
      <p>than they show to the public.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>They walk among us,</p>
      <p>quiet and collected, wise and inspired.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And I wish they could live forever,</p>
      <p>because that's what our world needs.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>But they are not going to be around forever,</p>
      <p>and they don't want anything that we can give them.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Except for one thing,</p>
      <p>us becoming great beings too.</p>
    </section>

    </section>

    <section>
      <p>My Friends, as wonderful and powerful as Wisdom is,</p>
      <p>Greatness, Greatness, is what the world needs.</p>
    </section>

    <section>

    </section>

    <section>
      <p>We have to stop accepting things,</p>
      <p>just because we were born into them.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>We have to stop being lead,</p>
      <p>and become leaders.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>You wan to know what The Meaning of Life Is,</p>
      <p>well let me tell you.</p>

    <section>
      <p>The meaning of your life,</p>
      <p>is to become a Great Being.</p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Everyone of us,</p>
      <p>a Great Being.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>That is the mistake we made,</p>
      <p>we thought that greatness is rare.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>But greatness,</p>
      <p>is what the world needs of us to grow.</p>
    </section>

    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Take to the Books,</p>
      <p>take to the audio books (they can't be easier, and adventure books are breathtaking),</p>
      <p>maybe, narrate the classics, and share with the Little Ones.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Avoid everything that is trying to teach you outside-in,</p>
      <p>and reach out to learn, to really, really learn, inside-out.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Don't memorize, don't seek grades,</p>
      <p>just inherit wisdom from a hundred audio books,</p>
      <p>and then listen to nine-hundred more, just to be sure.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Let us inherit wisdom from Humanity's most loved modern audio books,</p>
      <p>and let us fill ourselves with knowledge from a thousand lives,</p>
      <p>knowledge will grant us wisdom,</p>
      <p>and then let us rise and become leaders.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Leadership and Wisdom,</p>
      <p>will drive us forward,</p>
      <p>to become Great Beings.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Let us do this,</p>
      <p>not for Heroes but for Humanity and the future,</p>
      <p>for each other.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The world will only become better,</p>
      <p>when each of us, accepts the responsibility for becoming a Great Being.</p>
