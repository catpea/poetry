      <p>Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Thirty Four.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I finished a big program, but I am ready for more.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>So, I am writing a poem, and its always very hard,</p>
      <p>because I never know what its going to be about.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>One moment, I am mighty, serious, and athletic,</p>
      <p>then I sit to the poem, and I lose that aesthetic.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>In my early 20s I wore a Blues Brother suit for office work,</p>
      <p>but even that didn't work, cause I added cowboy-shoes,</p>
      <p>and a huge buckle, not a day past when I didn't get a chuckle.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Later it got even worse, I wore leather pants and a Matrix coat,</p>
      <p>I fit into my coffee shop like a mountain goat.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Being serious is just too darn hard,</p>
      <p>I don't have the might,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>OK, that's enough for this poetic flight,</p>
      <p>I am done writing, y'all have goodnight.</p>
