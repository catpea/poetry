      <p>You can't finish by simply getting to the end,</p>
      <p>if you don't start in the beginning.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>We learn a new language out there,</p>
      <p>the edge grants us a new vocabulary.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>A vocabulary, is also an aid for thinking,</p>
      <p>it helps us navigate better.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And the edge is a sacred place,</p>
      <p>there you can quietly comprehend what all Great Beings speak of.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And, it becomes your anchor,</p>
      <p>the thing that makes sense.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>it becomes the point from which you measure other things,</p>
      <p>as you progress forward.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And, Look who else is here,</p>
      <p>the Elder You.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>They all come here, at every plateau, in each great loneliness,</p>
      <p>ask them what their regrets are, and prevent them all from occurring.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The edge is a sacred place,</p>
      <p>you are always safe out here, you are always welcome, and you are never alone.</p>
