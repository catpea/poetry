      <p>Surely, this is a very mild winter season,</p>
      <p>and Spring will come a month sooner just for that reason.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Therefore, we are really just about 84 days away,</p>
      <p>it is coming real fast even though today the sky was gray.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And since this was an extremely warm year,</p>
      <p>we can be certain that Spring really is near.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I'd say we are looking at just about 54 days in total,</p>
      <p>and this is hard evidence, not at all, anecdotal.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>But you know, as well as I do too,</p>
      <p>that this Spring will be a meteorological breakthrough.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>So all in total, give or take a day,</p>
      <p>I think Spring is just about 24 days away.</p>
