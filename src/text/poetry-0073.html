    <section>
      <p>We often think of consequences to mistakes,</p>
      <p>but consequence does not pick.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>So as long as we keep to our paths,</p>
      <p>all our actions cast changes ahead.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>In mistakes, lessons await,</p>
      <p>in good deeds, we find family.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>In great adventure, we'll find mountains,</p>
      <p>in great achievements, calm and peace.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>In darkness, we will find light,</p>
      <p>in isolation, we'll find hugs.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>So as long as we keep to our paths.</p>
      <p>what we shall find will make us stronger.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>However, if we dare so to diverge,</p>
      <p>all we have cast we'll be lost.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Perhaps no shadows, but certainly no light,</p>
      <p>no lessons, no sweetness, no might.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>By switching paths we'll find fewer wisdoms,</p>
      <p>and far more things that don't fit us.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>We'll also find a force of opposition,</p>
      <p>it will keep our minds tired.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>It will be unclear why life seems strange,</p>
      <p>why everything takes so much more to see.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Why we seem to lack confidence,</p>
      <p>or how everyone else has so much of it.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>But, the most troubling thing, my Dear Friends,</p>
      <p>is in how easy it is to diverge.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>There is a place for Leaps of Faith in life,</p>
      <p>they are quite sacred, and as beautiful.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>But, to fill in a stranger's blanks,</p>
      <p>or trust that the others know what they are doing.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>To listen to good advice that considers you naught,</p>
      <p>or give something up of your self, and not know why.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>To go to a place because everyone went there,</p>
      <p>to bow because all others bowed.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>That is not sacred, sacrilegious maybe,</p>
      <p>you must never follow, you must always lead.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Even more troubling is how it all collapses,</p>
      <p>not with a bang, but a stupid sick whimper:</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>"How were they supposed to know",</p>
      <p>"How was I supposed to know?"</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>All the blame for what others did,</p>
      <p>to Your Sacred Self, somehow falls back right on you.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And then it turns out,</p>
      <p>your lesson is all over cheap paperbacks.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Everyone has been trough this,</p>
      <p>and none were the wiser.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>All those confident faces and smiles, were faked,</p>
      <p>and the more convincing they try to be, the less they are in pain.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>When someone is putting you at risk,</p>
      <p>take a split second to imagine them saying:</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>"How was I supposed to know?", and stand your ground.</p>
      <p>You are not to follow, you are to lead.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Let them have have their stupid games, and drinks, temporary junk,</p>
      <p>you go to the DIA, take some notes, and splurge on clay.</p>
