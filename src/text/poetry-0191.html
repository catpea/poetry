    <section>
      <p>Grab onto your butts,</p>
      <p>we are about to nuts!</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>We are headed back in time,</p>
      <p>to make a little bit of rhyme.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Do you want to know,</p>
      <p>where and when we are going?</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Greece! 390 BC,</p>
      <p>to see about a real teacher, having a walk with his students by the sea.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Everyone else was stuck in their own life,</p>
      <p>and Socrates too in his own way, was contemplating strife...</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>But he made a big breakthrough,</p>
      <p>as he understood, how he grew.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>It was all the lessons he was adding together,</p>
      <p>while! ignoring all that did not matter.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>"Oh wow" - he finally proclaimed - "I really do know how I grew",</p>
      <p>then turned to his students and said, "and so should you!"</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>He told them, that when people are stuck,</p>
      <p>they only run in circles, and out of luck.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>We must learn to study what is wise,</p>
      <p>but also, ignore the less important so that we have a chance to rise.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And then once we become smart,</p>
      <p>we can go all the way back, if we wish,</p>
      <p>and begin super-smart at start.</p>
    </section>

    <section><hr></section>

    <section>
      <p>OK, we must now return back to our time,</p>
      <p>as we now have a whole poem full of rhyme.</p>
    </section>

    <section><hr></section>

    <section>
      <p>So, the lesson for this evening is this:</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Life is not a confusing mess or some dark abyss,</p>
      <p>it is meant be lived in wisdom, with foresight and in pure bliss.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>But to get there we must both; learn what to ignore,</p>
      <p>and figure out what's important so we can stay on that sunny shore.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And we really, really, really need to ask this question,</p>
      <p>this is not some strange rhyming suggestion.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>What is real, what is fake?</p>
      <p>what is merely keeping you busy - your whole life is at stake!</p>
    </section>

    <section><hr></section>

    <section>
      <p>Are you learning in school, becoming wiser every day?</p>
      <p>Or are they forcing your with grades, to merely role play?</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Because if your school is fake, merely playing the role of a babysitter,</p>
      <p>then they are tricking you our of wisdom, and you should be bitter.</p>
    </section>

    <section><hr></section>

    <section>
      <p>Education is the first big deal in life,</p>
      <p>it will help you fix problems before they begin, and keep you out of strife.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>If you are not learning, then listen to lectures and audio books,</p>
      <p>learn to avoid strife, and stray away from these crooks.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Do not let crappy teachers sell your mind for their pay check with charades,</p>
      <p>tell them you want real knowledge not fake grades.</p>
    </section>

    <section><hr></section>

    <section>
      <p>Don't let anybody trick you into a fake education,</p>
      <p>because that never lead to a real graduation.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Visit your elder self, make sure that they remember who they are,</p>
      <p>make sure their knowledge is as densely packed as a Neutron Star,</p>
      <p>- if not then try to figure out what their regrets are.</p>
    </section>

    <section><hr></section>

    <section>
      <p>You know what?! either way,</p>
      <p>start listening to real lectures and powerful audio books, every day.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Authenticity Above All, do it for Socrates, do it for the Elder You,</p>
      <p>ignore all the crooks, read your own books.</p>
    </section>
