      <p>There cannot be jogging without acting crazy,</p>
      <p>if you're not snarling and spitting you're just being lazy.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Not to mention that its discussing to swallow those little files,</p>
      <p>you're not supposed to <strong>keep</strong> them, they're not your prize.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Ultimately, it makes no difference what race it may be,</p>
      <p>manners go out the window, the moment you bend your knee.</p>

      <p>Plus, nobody really runs to win the race,</p>
      <p>we just set the correct pace and run to find our place in Space.</p>

      <p>The physical challenge is found in taking each step,</p>
      <p>and not stopping until the last rep.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>But that's easy, it is the simplest thing about it all,</p>
      <p>your body just gets used to it, and has a ball.</p>

      <p>Jogging is mostly a little reminder that we are to turn our life to Art,</p>
      <p>that we are to overcome our limits, and become super smart.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The actual achievement is found in finishing what we start,</p>
      <p>and the thousand other things we finish, by <em>subtle analogy</em> to this odd Art.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>In a word, we jog for our future selves,</p>
      <p>so that they may become <strong>proud</strong> of themselves.</p>
