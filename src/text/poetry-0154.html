      <p>I woke up early,</p>
      <p>dressed barely.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Just enough so that I am not bare,</p>
      <p>and jumped on my iron mare.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>We set course away from the sun,</p>
      <p>and just like that we ran.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Some quarter way through,</p>
      <p>we had to turn left towards the dew.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>But then the road went straight,</p>
      <p>and all the way till the end the ride was great.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>The road was long,</p>
      <p>and birds full of song.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>The wind blew fresh air,</p>
      <p>as we flew without a care.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>On the way back home the sun was on the rise,</p>
      <p>and it blinded my eyes.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>But I rode all the way back,</p>
      <p>by just following my old track.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>And so the mare and I parted,</p>
      <p>all before the day even started.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>She's packed and ready to go, waiting for sun to rise,</p>
      <p>and so we'll ride again as soon as I open my eyes.</p>
    </div>
