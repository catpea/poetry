      <p>Where do we come from, and why are we here,</p>
      <p>are just silly questions.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>While even silly questions lead to good things,</p>
      <p>they're not the primary questions we need to answer - like what makes us unique, and what do we love, and where are going to go, and what great mountains must we face.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>We are here because there was no one to count the failed attempts,</p>
      <p>because the universe was running out of other paths.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>There was no plan,</p>
      <p>there was just a progression forward.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Universally speaking, there is probably plenty of life out there,</p>
      <p>but what the Universe will never have, cannot build, is another You.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>If someone tried to take your place,</p>
      <p>it could never work, ever, at all.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>In All This Complexity,</p>
      <p>You Are One And Only.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>There will never be another you,</p>
      <p>ever.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>It is because at a certain point, the Universe stops, and your ideas take over,</p>
      <p>you become the creator, you become a Youniverse within a Universe.</p>

    <section>
      <p>You are plenty special, but if you only move forward,</p>
      <p>you will not gain the capacity to fully share who you are.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The universe will know, that you are Majestic, and Adventurous,</p>
      <p>and sometimes, Mischievous. But we need more of you!</p>
    </section>

      <p>and maybe continue your work.</p>

    <section>
      <p>The Wisdom you will gain from your Pursuits of Excellence,</p>
      <p>will be unlike anything else the Universe has ever seen before.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>You will speak in your own pictures, with your personal touch,</p>
      <p>and the words you love, and above all the Paths You Took.</p>
