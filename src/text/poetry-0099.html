      <p>No one regrets becoming wise,</p>
      <p>no adult ever wished to stay a child.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>All the grownups,</p>
      <p>embrace the powers they developed.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>You can see it in the way</p>
      <p>they Nobly &amp; Calmly carry themselves.</p>

    <section>
      <p>The time meant for your growing up,</p>
      <p>should not be disrupted in any way.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Growing up,</p>
      <p>is not as random as it seems.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Your own observations,</p>
      <p>will create questions.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Questions will sprout affinities,</p>
      <p>and affinities will draw you towards places with answers.</p>

      <p>Growing up, begins with simple questions, and simple answers,</p>
      <p>but we amass a library of twisty little passages.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Later in life,</p>
      <p>we apply those passages other things.</p>

    <section>
      <p>We face the Universe,</p>
      <p>and there are consequences to all our actions.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>What do we do when the bullies come?</p>
      <p>We learn to practice restraint, so that we don't end up the snarling beasts they are.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>What do we do, when people belittle us, step on us?</p>
      <p>We expand our own sense of Dignity, and Nobility into an Independent Universe free of their flaws and limitations.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And how do we stand up against Isolation, or being Cast Away?</p>
      <p>With Unbreakability, Fortitude, Courage and Honor.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The meaning of life?</p>
      <p>The meaning of life is always found in Love.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And how do we learn to see and rise and better ourselves?</p>
      <p>With Insight; and Foresight; and Understanding; and Authenticity; and Heroism;</p>

      <p>My Dear Friends,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Your growing up,</p>
      <p>is the very Formation of you.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>This is not a process that anyone is allowed to interrupt,</p>
      <p>you are not allowed to have anybody step in your way.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>It is like learning to walk,</p>
      <p>no one is allowed to push you to the ground.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I don't know if there is anything more sacred,</p>
      <p>than your growing up.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>You must learn to push what is not important away,</p>
      <p>you must get comfortable with not following.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And you must stand your ground, or walk your path...</p>
      <p>You must, lead.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>You must make sure that you rise a little higher each and every day,</p>
      <p>and that each day adds to the previous.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Growing Up Is Sacred,</p>
      <p>It Is Your Right.</p>
