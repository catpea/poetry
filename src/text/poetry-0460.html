    <div class="section">
      <p>Our minds are already beautiful,</p>
      <p>but we can make them even more beautiful.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Simply by standing up,</p>
      <p>and refusing to follow, without Knowledge, and Wisdom, and even Greatness.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>When we follow,</p>
      <p>we tend to end up in places that seem strange, if not alien, and it certainly does not seem like we belong there.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>School is like this,</p>
      <p>it sneaks up on us.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We go to school and begin waiting and memorizing instead of learning for real,</p>
      <p>because everybody else does that too, and we go because our parents went.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We make ourselves and, whatever that career is,</p>
      <p>fit.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But it is never quite,</p>
      <p>where we need to be.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Because when we do not lead,</p>
      <p>we are bit by bit pushed off course.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>A large part of that,</p>
      <p>is that the school never really, truly, fully, gave you a full choice of subjects,</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You had to pick from what was available,</p>
      <p>and what was available, were subjects that, everyone else was picking.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Not only that, but also, you got, kind of manipulated into not picking some of the classes that interested you,</p>
      <p>either the prerequisites were set too high (to filter out low scoring students), or the teacher was iffy (to save money on a real professor).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The teacher also might have been acting wild, in a friendly way,</p>
      <p>and that type of behavior pushes away students that want a stable class, with a predictable and well mannered professor.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You got an impression of choice,</p>
      <p>but in all actuality, you didn't even know the fields that would have interested you.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>That was a promise that would be tucked away behind luck,</p>
      <p>if you were lucky to be picked by a prestigious open curriculum university, then maybe.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But even then, you weren't even within the culture (or the slipstream) of achievement,</p>
      <p>and whatever culture you could enter, by definition would be incompatible with your unique interests; it would be a culture of bunch of other people.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Socializing is great,</p>
      <p>but not in context of greatly multiplying your knowledge and intelligence, so that you have a full picture of the world.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Let me just say,</p>
      <p>that greatly multiplying knowledge and intelligence, is what we do as babies, what we do by default.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Now, we do need a certain kind of guidance,</p>
      <p>yes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We need to be taken to a Digital Audio Workstation, so that we are introduced to it,</p>
      <p>and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRvkaxh8EU">and we need to see someone operating a piano roll</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But this requires,</p>
      <p>27 minutes and 51 seconds.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You see what the problem is,</p>
      <p>the poverty of your school takes the piano, away from you.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Or Microbiology at its most fascinating,</p>
      <p>actually getting to befriend Tardigrades through your own microscope, through your own eyes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And often,</p>
      <p>just about everything else that is fascinating.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxyKNMrhEvY">And they do it by mistake, and out of disrespect and dark ages</a>,</p>
      <p>and to make the work of teaching a mass of students, more realistic.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But without the piano,</p>
      <p>you don't become convinced that everything is a system of accessible easy to manipulate man-made concepts.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>In deed, you are likely to end up being threatened to stop thinking about the piano,</p>
      <p>threatened with prison, the prison of being held back a year.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You are constantly nudged off path,</p>
      <p>and threatened with shame or punishment when you resist.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Focus on the path ahead,</p>
      <p>and ask, what if you were to make informed choices that were precisely your own.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Let me define a term here,</p>
      <p>an informed choice is informed by about ten books, though you probably need to read-or-listen-to about fifty, to find those ten.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>So here, rather than relying on classes that your school offers,</p>
      <p>you expand your horizon of possibility...</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>and begin relying on enchanting and deeply interesting _to you_,</p>
      <p>narrated books.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Now. Look, at the road ahead of you,</p>
      <p>is the road ahead of you not, more customized to who you are?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Precisely because you reached out for books and narrated books,</p>
      <p>and not; kept yourself boxed in a handful of classes, shame, and creepy threats...</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>..that your school offers,</p>
      <p>because other students tend to pick those most often.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>This is not to say that there is a conspiracy to deny you knowledge,</p>
      <p>but rather that schools are not able to teach you Greatness and Beauty of Mind.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>For one they don't get enough funding,</p>
      <p>but also, Humans Are Stingy, would teachers teach you better, if they got paid more, or would they conserve their strength, and only do as much as strictly necessary.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You should not trust others with your own education,</p>
      <p>you, should accept the responsibility for it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is a s easy as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPSvdKTEZug">Appalachian Trail</a>,</p>
      <p>a Thousand Audio Books, and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoqgAy3h4OM">series of start-ups</a>.</p>

      <p>A beautiful mind, is a lot more important than it may seem,</p>
      <p>it is a great step towards greatness.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And Greatness,</p>
      <p>makes all the difference.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>For a long time now,</p>
      <p>the world has been becoming more and more desperate for wisdom.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And the only way, the world can grow in wisdom,</p>
      <p>is when you, and all other human beings on earth accept that challenge.</p>

      <p>There are little over</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>A beautiful mind,</p>
      <p>and the Greatness that stems from it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>May soon,</p>
      <p>no longer be optional.</p>

      <p>Gandhi said that he was inspired in part by Thoreau,</p>

      <p>Thoreau himself was inspired by Aristotle,</p>
      <p>who was influenced by Plato and Socrates.</p>

      <p>Something as simple as choosing your own path,</p>
      <p>so as long as it is towards Beauty and Greatness...</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Is infinitely more important than following others, or doing what you parents want you to do,</p>
      <p>or getting into a good school.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And you can still do all those things,</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Accepting the responsibility for a fine self education that has no equal,</p>
