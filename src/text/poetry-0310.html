      <p>If you don't like Audio Books, then you are going too fast through life,</p>
      <p>you have to slow down, all the way down until your Heart begins calling for wisdom.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Look, whatever we think we know, is almost certainly incomplete without books,</p>
      <p>and it takes just a few months to love your way through a hundred of them.</p>

      <p>Books are always about connection, they will either show you that you are not alone,</p>
      <p>or they will sing to you in such a way that you will leap over several of your next plateaus.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Books will make you stronger, more resilient, more courageous,</p>
      <p>more insightful, they will help you see into many of your futures.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The only thing they can't give you is the things you already have,</p>
      <p>like beauty, intelligence, creativity, and majesty.</p>

      <p>Even though you did not live the lives you inherited from within books,</p>
      <p>you know that they are solid, that the conclusions you draw from them are valid.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>It is not just about some memories from a book you once read,</p>
      <p>it is about the kingdom of knowledge within you, an actual city full of roads and libraries.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Each time you read, and re-read as you learn to learn more,</p>
      <p>you grow in your modes of thinking, you expand your inner-navigation capabilities.</p>

    <section>
      <p>We are really good navigation, be in on the outside, or within out body of knowledge,</p>
      <p>but what is a navigator in a tiny city of a few buildings.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The more we expand our city, the more we begin to excel at navigation of greater and greater things,</p>
      <p>be it our personal decision making, or how we relate to other people and the places we aim, to go towards, in life.</p>

    <section>
      <p>The bigger our body of knowledge,</p>
      <p>the more we can see into the future, the more is the future that unfolds before us connected to us.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Knowledge is is the thunderstorm that backs freedom, that prevents us from being permanently misled,</p>
      <p>it is the tool that unravels all those things that are inauthentic.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I hope you can make room for wise stories from other lives,</p>
      <p>it makes a world of difference.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>May you discover all the world's most beautiful adventures,</p>
      <p>and treasures, day dreams and inspirations - and grow, to no end.</p>
