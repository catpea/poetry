      <p>Today's smart phones,</p>
      <p>contain disconnected walled gardens and distant islands of functionality.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The design principle revolves around that old apocryphal story,</p>
      <p>where Willie Sutton upon being asked why he robbed banks, responded:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>"because that's where the money is."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>This is not a design principle,</p>
      <p>this has nothing to do with invention.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The leading operating system and phone manufacturers,</p>
      <p>have been beat by the little Pine Phone without much of any effort.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And of course, the Pine Phone Operating System,</p>
      <p>being closer to the pure Linux... is far more powerful.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is not just Pine Phone, but also Raspberry PI,</p>
      <p>with a 4G modem, UPS/Battery and touchscreen, and a custom case.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Here we have to think in four dimensions, it will be larger,</p>
      <p>but with room for extra hardware and the power of a proper desktop.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The Raspberry PI or any Single Board Computer (SBC), is the modular phone,</p>
      <p>that people don't yet realize they want.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    <div class="section">
      <p>This is not a question of hardware,</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQx1I03DsmY">hardware is a tough business, as Samsung's exploding phones teach us</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>To this day Pine Phone, warns that dead pixels on the screen are normal,</p>
      <p>and not purchase their phones, if that will cause a return.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Dealing with hardware problems,</p>
      <p>is expensive, and doubly so for companies that do not yet have large financial backing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The Raspberry PI and the other SBCs are an exception here,</p>
      <p>because you are buying everything a piece at a time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But this _is_ a question of software,</p>
      <p>the underlying operating systems must be easy to access.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The phone has to boot the same way that a computer does,</p>
      <p>by trapping the users within some abstraction layer the companies destroy the computer.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>What this means, is that the company that will bring the computer back,</p>
      <p>as in not bother with an alternative GUI, will easily overpower the leading giants.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>An unrestricted Linux device like the Pine Phone, or Librem 5,</p>
      <p>has a lot more to offer than privacy violations, photo leaks and candy crush.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>They offer real functionality,</p>
      <p>with a world of developers that feel comfortable programming for Linux or BSD.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Once the restriction of the Simplified Graphical Shell (like Android or MacOS) is removed,</p>
      <p>the underlying operating system will be exposed to real developers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>One of the first things people will program are clones of the leading Simplified Graphical Shells,</p>
      <p>the simplicity will always be there, but not at restart... it will require the poke of an icon on a real mobile desktop.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Android is just an app on the Linux underneath,</p>
      <p>I am sure that programmers integrated it far more since, and it is now part of the customized Linux underneath, but it is just a program.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>A program that is pushing away real programmers from programming their own way,</p>
      <p>and creating a market for phones that don't do that.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>That principle of "of I rob banks, because that's where the money is.",</p>
      <p>creates a great weakness for leading smartphone manufacturers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>While they tend to the flowers of their walled gardens,</p>
      <p>phones like Librem 5, and the Pine Phone are letting everyone know that the smartphone market isn't dominated.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>There is just a couple of companies in a little corner,</p>
      <p>yelling loudly at the sky, while shooting themselves in the foot.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We can't really tell what the real phone will look like,</p>
      <p>it needs an evolution, not a shortsighted revolution as we have seen thus far.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I am a Zaurus user, I was already uncomfortable with GUI shell quirks back in mid 2000's,</p>
      <p>when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp_Zaurus">SL-5500</a> came out.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But, there were no real restrictions,</p>
      <p>and I had fun programming it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Just because not everyone is into programming,</p>
      <p>doesn't mean that unrestricted access to the OS won't benefit them.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>There will be a lot more programs,</p>
      <p>and a lot more better ideas.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We can see some bubbles of potential functionality forming today,</p>
      <p>the conversational user interface, like Siri is an OK-ish idea.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>A more chat-room like experience with multiple bots,</p>
      <p>would be even better.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXVKKGp1h5M">And there is a friendly programming language emerging already as demonstrated by IFTTT and Zapier</a>,</p>
      <p>though it is far from perfect, it is still somewhat of an improvement over <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFvWBFl2wxY">Automator</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>These work flows are just pipes, or even less than that,</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tc4ROCJYbm0">simple commands as described by Brian Kernighan in the 1982's The UNIX System</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is a lot of user interface to just spell out some commands,</p>
      <p>but done correctly, it can work.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The correct implementation of a GUI based work-flow program,</p>
      <p>is one that just helps with creating Linux Command Lines, or shell scripts.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And it works both ways,</p>
      <p>it can convert shell scripts and one liners to GUI and back.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>There is nothing special about this,</p>
      <p>this has been all thought up by decades ago, except every implementation failed because it had no vision beyond wall gardens and cheap money grabs.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is important to have a round trip from command line to GUI,</p>
      <p>and from GUI to command line, because that is how people learn programming.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We witnessed something similar in the view source feature, and not developer console of a browser,</p>
      <p>just being able to match the visuals to the code helps a person learn how to use the code.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The incentive for using code is great,</p>
      <p>as using the GUI is many times slower.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The difference is like dragging words from a dictionary,</p>
      <p>vs actually typing them, it takes 10 seconds to find the word in a dictionary and one second to type it out.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Like wise, it takes 10 seconds to find an action in a library of actions,</p>
      <p>and just one second to write it's name on the command line.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Then there are your dot files, and user profiles,</p>
      <p>you want to have one account on your phone for business and another for home.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>When logged in to both,</p>
      <p>you can easily switch between the two.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Your business account,</p>
      <p>will be connected to your business email.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Where your home account will be connected to the family email account,</p>
      <p>this means that different login credentials will exist in your profiles.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Your business account may use a lot more third party services,</p>
      <p>and they have to be kept separate from home related things.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The Automator/IFTT and Zapier like application will be able to see which services you use,</p>
      <p>and will offer different sets of actions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is silly that multiple users or profiles can't log into a phone,</p>
      <p>based on a multi-user operating system, frankly it is embarrassing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>As to apps, games,</p>
      <p>and viruses.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Walled gardens obscure bugs, security by obscurity is a bad idea,</p>
      <p>everything must be open, and eyes must be all over the code.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>That is exactly what Linux has right now,</p>
      <p>adding a whole new layer on top of it, even if it is largely open source just expands the attack surface.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The idea of creating a safe app framework, has been proven false time and again,</p>
      <p>by app that stole private information from the phone (most recently I heard of a flashlight app ding the stealing).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I should also note, that creating a single application framework and choosing a single language;</p>
      <p>to create all the apps in, is an astonishing display of arrogance, ignorance, and the misunderstanding of the underlying operating system, and all the technological revolutions that brought us were.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>One could write a whole miserable book listing all the bad ideas behind that decision,</p>
      <p>here I'll point any lead developers wanting to argue this point to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnCgoEyz31M">Brian<a/>, as he still seems to enjoy elucidating the novice programmer on that point.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>On a normal linux system, a weather or flashlight app won't track you,</p>
      <p>one is a matter of extracting GPS coordinates and making an HTTP request to a weather service, and the other a simple system call.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>There is no app here, there is no middleman grabbing GPS data,</p>
      <p>just a HTTP curl request to a weather service, dressed up by a local GUI widget, like on a desktop Linux.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>There is a lot of games that will compile on a standard Linux phone,</p>
      <p>there are plenty of frameworks that will do a great job.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>People who want big games need a game console,</p>
      <p>which also should be open, consoles of today suffer from customized walled gardens as means to squeeze every cent out of a customer that already paid.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Apps, is what Linux does, and almost all are free,</p>
      <p>certainly all the good ones, that culture of free open source would continue on the pure Linux Phone as well.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>There would be no shortage of apps,</p>
      <p>there would be an increase in contributors, and bandwidth donors, and mirrors, and so on.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Predictably, Apps, Games, and Security would be superior to that on leading smart-phones of today,</p>
      <p>and the increase of care and attention would benefit security on both the desktop and mobile.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Today's leading smartphone platforms,</p>
      <p>are just a side road that we'll eventually forget.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Had they stayed in the mainstream,</p>
      <p>their contributions would be more significant and more valuable pushing the evolution of Linux beyond what it is today, past a simplified desktop and into a world where the common user can write programs.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>In closing, stay away from hardware,</p>
      <p>but know that hardware is simple.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>All that is required to bring bout a range of Linux phones,</p>
      <p>is to get them without the extra locks and restrictions that cripple the ability to install standard Linux.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Put on a linux friendly distribution, and there is a number of them,</p>
      <p>and voila.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Just like people are buying the Pine Phone without any advertising on TV,</p>
      <p>they would be buying the $100 to $150 no brand linux phones that come in different shapes and sizes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And the advertising comes from social media, from word of mouth,</p>
      <p>a cheap no brand pure linux phone that can help the user out program most of the apps in walled gardens, would spread like a wildfire.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>In all their programming and years of development,</p>
      <p>the leading smartphone platforms achieved nothing to beat 1980's programming powers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>In all their programming, or shall we say madness,</p>
      <p>they only created more attack vectors and sacrificed user privacy, while finding new ways to gag them with ads.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The biggest threat to these giants,</p>
      <p>is the bare operating system that they crammed their small minded ideas on...</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>They robbed the bank, because that is where the money was,</p>
      <p>but they also shot themselves in the foot, and now have no leg to stand on, when facing something as trivial as the cute and little $150 Pine Phone.</p>
