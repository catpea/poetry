      <p>School presents access to knowledge with something so synthetic and abstract,</p>
      <p>that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ws6qmXDJgwU">we can't learn, because it is too incomprehensible and can only be temporary memorized</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We each have a unique pathway with which we access knowledge,</p>
      <p>it is a cheerful Spring time maze of curiosities and discoveries.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>A school does conspire to convince us that we are not smart enough to learn,</p>
      <p>it was never meant to be this way.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Schools were meant to set the world free and put an end to wars,</p>
      <p>put an end to sending children to wars.</p>

      <p>A formula is not something you memorize,</p>
      <p>it is tool you look up to make some beautiful graphics for a screen-saver or an art show.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>There is only one reason why a student would be abused to memorize formulas,</p>
      <p>testing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is a test of the teacher,</p>
      <p>if the classroom grade point average is above a certain point, then the teacher is working.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>From another perspective,</p>
      <p>if a teacher can show a good class GPA, then they can demand to get paid and keep their job.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Forcing students into memorizing formulas has nothing to do with teaching them,</p>
      <p>it is just a test of the teacher.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Pop quizzes, Quizzes, Tests, take out a piece of paper,</p>
      <p>is the teacher making sure they will get to keep their job.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>State and national level tests are even worse,</p>
      <p>they are little more than crossword puzzles that rely on insider knowledge.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Insider knowledge,</p>
      <p>is the network of those miserable facts that fade as soon as we graduate.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The whole is a self serving machine that distributes tax payer money to teachers and higher ups,</p>
      <p>there is no real education to be found here.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The test difficulty merely convinces everyone who participates in the charade,</p>
      <p>that a lot of work was involved, hard work, that required hard working, oh so hard.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>A hard test on a difficult subject, is not that different,</p>
      <p>from a Drill Sargent sending a boy to mop up a parking lot in the rain.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Lessons and Tests,</p>
      <p>are not an education.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is an insult,</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmoor8DwqW4">especially to the younger students that don't yet have enough experience to figure out it is about the teachers and not students</a>.</p>

      <p>The worst thing about this is that people become truly convinced they are not smart enough,</p>
      <p>the broken school not only insult, but in their haste for paychecks defraud people of knowledge.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>If pressed by a competent congress, the principals would state,</p>
      <p>that everyone should know that knowledge is free.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>If pressed, they will say,</p>
      <p>we are not required to teach your children, and present an entire bouquet of reason and evidence.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>They will state,</p>
      <p>that they are required to pass standardized tests, and that is exactly what they do.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>There is no need for teaching real, functional, inspirational knowledge,</p>
      <p>the point of a school is tho get the students to past the tests.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Because that is how everyone gets paid,</p>
      <p>and that is how parents get a free babysitter.</p>

      <p>Strange elections, vaccine hesitancy, science denial, nationalism, racism, mind crushing poverty,</p>
      <p>are just the more visible symptoms.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Real schools hold such a beautiful promise,</p>
      <p>a real curriculum that provides real positive results would spread around the world's nations like wildfire.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It would quickly change how people and their representatives see the world,</p>
      <p>issues like pollution, climate, insider trading, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_American_state_and_local_politicians_convicted_of_crimes">corrupt politics</a>, would fade away.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We have the room for Real Schools, but it is filled with something else,</p>
      <p>it is hard to describe until you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxyKNMrhEvY">contrast real schools with the fake ones</a>.</p>
