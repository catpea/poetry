      <p>Every way of thinking about the world,</p>
      <p>brings us closer together, despite, what we are told.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>There is just one little thing to keep in mind,</p>
      <p>we have to leave all the bad ideas, behind.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Exchange of ideas came a long way,</p>
      <p>but we still need to eliminate foul play.</p>

    <section>
      <p>Because not everyone is educated,</p>
      <p>and without wisdom life gets complicated.</p>

      <p>Misinformed people are easily swayed,</p>
      <p>they are often unprepared, and very scared.</p>

      <p>And the best type of things to listen to,</p>
      <p>are memoirs or lectures, that enlarge a world view.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>We must stop bad education from tearing us apart,</p>
      <p>we each have to learn, and become smart.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>This day of Wisdom, and Peace that we yearn,</p>
      <p>comes closer each day that we learn.</p>
