      <p>Oh, much can be said,</p>
      <p>of what one thinks today,</p>
      <p>and another tomorrow morning.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>But, the world belongs,</p>
      <p>to all the future generations,</p>
      <p>we are just temporary residents.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>We are not to treat Earth,</p>
      <p>as if it only belonged to us.</p>

      <p>We are to stop lying to children,</p>
      <p>that memorization is education.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>We are to stop keeping in them in rows,</p>
      <p>dividing time into squares,</p>
      <p>and subjects into meaninglessness,</p>
      <p>in a one-for-all curriculum of poverty of mind.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Respect, is a reward, so don't demand it,</p>
      <p>it is not a demand anybody can make.</p>

      <hr>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>And we are to stop thinking in short term,</p>
      <p>rather than keeping ten million people in cages,</p>
      <p>we need to practice Crime Prevention and put an End to Poverty first.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Rather than economic fairy-tales,</p>
      <p>mutually assured destruction, and blind wars,</p>
      <p>we need to connect together across borders and in wisdom.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>There is very little prestige to be gained,</p>
      <p>from hard work and beautiful career, tailored suits,</p>
      <p>and expensive cafes if we are not paying attention to all the problems children face.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>That's just reality, the respect of the younger generations cannot be granted for free,</p>
      <p>children can't believe nonsense no matter how convincing the teachers,</p>
      <p>and the world won't grow without Wisdom.</p>

      <p>The world will wait,</p>
      <p>for several consecutive generations of Wise Beings,</p>
      <p>to converge on good ideas, in Peace and Earned Respect.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>It will wait.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>It need not be hard work, you know,</p>
      <p>reading books or listening to audio books comes so easy,</p>
      <p>and there is so much we learn - we inherit lifetimes of knowledge.</p>

      <p>Though it is Beautiful, and Healing, and Wonderful,</p>

      <p>Many of the problems that overwhelm us,</p>
      <p>really can't be repaired, the career politicians are lying.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The big problems,</p>
      <p>can only be prevented with Foresight, and Love, and Wisdom,</p>
      <p>and require hard work by multiple generations</p>
