    <div class="section">
      <p>Above all, you need a long-term reason to learn,</p>
      <p>if you are not involved in a particular field, then you will learn nothing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is easy to make excuses for seemingly learning math,</p>
      <p>"You won't always have a calculator on hand" or "By memorizing the multiplication table you'll be able to calculate faster".</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>That makes perfect sense, but that is not math,</p>
      <p>that's just calculations, adding numbers, double-checking the change you get from a cashier.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The simple reasons for math, have little to do with math,</p>
      <p>and always having a cool mini calculator on you, is pretty damn cool.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-83_series">TI-83</a>, is not as cool as it looks on the surface,</p>
      <p>for one it is overpriced, perhaps 10 times the price.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Supply and demand shouldn't apply to students,</p>
      <p>everything used in education from textbooks to laptops must be free.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>So cooler than the TI-83, is a calculator you program yourself,</p>
      <p>preferably by means of a high level programming language, maybe even a Raspberry PI Zero.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And of course, you see where this is going,</p>
      <p>by considering to program your own calculator you are teleported on the edge of the Great Canyon of Mathematics.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Now, every cool damn thing from Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Calculus, Engineering,</p>
      <p>to Generative Art, Antikythera Mechanism, Even Kryptos-analysis-tools and Black Hole and Big Crunch stand right in front of you</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Softly mocking you,</p>
      <p>for not being cool, yet.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Sure, what is a TI-83 inspired Raspberry PI to you,</p>
      <p>when you are never going to use the engineering formulas you gather.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is almost a fair point,</p>
      <p>but although we covered the reason for mathematics, we have not yet covered the reason for your reason.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Though it maybe hard to believe,</p>
      <p>it is not enough to just own the coolest calculator in the world.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You aren't supposed to pursue things for their own sake,</p>
      <p>every reason must have a reason.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>So you celebrate the day you set your foot in High School or College,</p>
      <p>by launching your first start-up.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Call it, Fair Instruments Incorporated, Model T-800,</p>
      <p>and just sell a Calculator Kit based on Raspberry PI Zero, to be assembled by the customer.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>This is also something that requires that you get investors,</p>
      <p>keep the company small, don't work hard, work smart, your goal should be to become a great being, not a mere business person.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>So now, not only are you plowing through math to build your first prototype,</p>
      <p>but you are doing it to become a business person and exit poverty, you will certainly exit the stress of poverty.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>As a bonus you could offer a distributed social network (by wirelessly connecting all the nearby Raspberry PI Zero W/s),</p>
      <p>and other projects like Collaborative Audio Book Recording, or a Synthesizer Cluster for a Collaborative School Symphony Orchestra.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You could run a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf_cluster">Beowulf Cluster</a>,</p>
      <p>or build a distributed search engine, the sky is not even the limit,</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Perhaps that should be your starting point,</p>
      <p>a Sky Net connecting all the schools together, and rebuilding education inside out by providing relevant and personalized lectures,</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You see the importance of using High Level Programming Languages,</p>
      <p>and a Standard Open Operating System... there are more lessons to be had.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>By going beyond a calculator, you leave the reality of simple mathematics,</p>
      <p>and enter the world of Programming, Communications, Robotics, Distributed Networking.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Perhaps eventually, you may even design your own PI/s,</p>
      <p>maybe this time with an Open 5G Hat, Aural (as in Audio) Interface, and a phone network meshing all the schools together with free internet and voice.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You don't have to start big with your prototype,</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://teenage.engineering">PO-128</a> is a good lesson to learn from, their entire product line is a dream.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But use Linux, and High Level Programming Languages,</p>
      <p>do not limit yourself with with a micro-controller stick with general purpose operating systems that people can learn valuable lessons from.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>If you want to start learning math right now,</p>
      <p>create a start-up that generates <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Se0_w0ISYk">generative art</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>There is always a need for interesting video backgrounds,</p>
      <p>and you can keep the company simple by just giving most of them them away.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>This is also the realm of <a href="https://pixijs.io/examples/">computer games</a>,</p>
      <p>think: auto-playing computer games.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And the on ramp is not that complex, see <a href="http://snapsvg.io/start/">Snap SVG</a> and <a href="https://p5js.org/">P5</a>,</p>
      <p>and see if maybe you are more interested in 3D graphics, via <a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>In closing, you can't real things really well if you have no real use for them,</p>
      <p>whatever you study must be part of your existence, your life.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And mathematics can easily become part of your life,</p>
      <p>if you take to a future of computer graphics, algorithms or even electronic devices.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>A word of caution, those who are making you memorize so that you perform on tests like an actor,</p>
      <p>do not have your best interests in mind.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Build your future</p>
      <p>- accept the responsibility for your own education.</p>
    </div>
