      <p>As winter nears,</p>
      <p>and snow appears.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>You need not worry,</p>
      <p>it is not end of Summers's glory.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Simply, look at weather, in Florida Keys,</p>
      <p>no doubt it will be 83 or more degrees.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Often Georgia is also very nice,</p>
      <p>and it is not too far, and may suffice.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Don't let snow make you fell lonely or sad,</p>
      <p>because things aren't that bad.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Plus.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>There is a couple more reasons,</p>
      <p>for one, the equator reverses seasons.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>And two, there are people that walk from Georgia to Maine,</p>
      <p>from early Spring to Autumn they hardly ever complain.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Those are the Appalacian Trail Hikers of course,</p>
      <p>beautiful, powerful, and as strong as many a horse.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>From Springer Mountain to Mount Katahdin they walk,</p>
      <p>crossing every mountain, valley, woodland, and rock.</p>
    </div>

      <p>So if Winter ever makes you feel sad,</p>
      <p>then it is time for change, and you should be glad.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Because, wintry sadness is a universal call,</p>
      <p>a call for adventure, that rings in us all.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Whether you are only going to drive to Georgia and back,</p>
      <p>go all the way to the Keys, or start shopping for a backpack.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Growing up is something that people who love you, want you to do,</p>
      <p>they know that to thine own self, you must be true.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Our lives are precious and we are not workers of any kind,</p>
      <p>we are dreamers and thinkers and we are not meant to live blind.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>You are at your most beautiful when you are Happy and Strong,</p>
      <p>so grab your loved ones and have them come along.</p>
