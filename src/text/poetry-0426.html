    <div class="section">
      <p>There was a couple of old trees,</p>
      <p>far up on a hill.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>When I was little I use to wonder about them,</p>
      <p>once I grew up a little I used to wander towards them.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It was a perfectly calm place,</p>
      <p>be it winter or summer.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>There were no troubles there,</p>
      <p>so I had a lot of fun.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I used to make proper little bonfires,</p>
      <p>out of the branches that fell from the wind.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I tried to figure out how the world works,</p>
      <p>from up there.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I figured,</p>
      <p>it wasn't working very well.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I grew up in a country with protests,</p>
      <p>shortages, and probably a lot of corruption.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>When I was eight, the Chernobyl disaster struck,</p>
      <p>people were told to stay home behind concrete walls.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I remember people reminding each other not to pick up mushrooms,</p>
      <p>as they had something to do with radiation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>There was a strange man on TV Anatoly Kashpirovsky,</p>
      <p>and people were pretending that he was healing them.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Some said that after they warmed up the gunk in their Russian watches by holding them in their hand,</p>
      <p>it would be him that would restart them, other said he was sharpening their razors or something.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>All too weird for me, so I'd slowly climb my way up that enormous hill to my Rain Makers</p>
      <p>and stare at the world from up there.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I came up with the name Rain Makers,</p>
      <p>they looked like they were scratching clouds.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>One time I brought a slice of refrigerated home made up there pizza up there,</p>
      <p>my mom made it the day before, it had olives.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It was too cold to eat it right,</p>
      <p>it was a shame to eat it cold like that.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>So I started a proper little fire,</p>
      <p>I always had matches with me.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And I somewhat-believe it was me who invented a sure way to start a fire,</p>
      <p>you had to start with twigs that were just about the size of the match.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And then sprinkle in larger, and larger, and larger bits,</p>
      <p>until the fire was cheerfully crackling.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I sharpened a stick that stabilized the slice,</p>
      <p>and started heating it up.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Just the moment I did that,</p>
      <p>rain came, the ground was already somewhat muddy - it was a rainy day.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I looked around and figured I should build a shelter,</p>
      <p>to keep myself dry.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I easily moved a load of mud above a thick root,</p>
      <p>and scooped a place for myself to perch in.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Few more sticks, and some downed branches with leaves on them,</p>
      <p>and I had a waterproof stealth shelter worthy of a big fat rabbit.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I hunkered down into the hole,</p>
      <p>and ate my slice of pizza that went from tasting odd due to being cold...</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>To now tasting and smelling weird,</p>
      <p>as I was using leaves to keep the fire going.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I had no idea it would make my slice smell and somewhat even taste odd,</p>
      <p>but I enjoyed it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The rain stopped,</p>
      <p>and so so I slowly started making my way back down to the village.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Always somewhat worried if any geese want to hiss at me again,</p>
      <p>and if perhaps I could find something interesting in the endless boxes at the garage.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The geese were a huge problem for me,</p>
      <p>to make things worse they would always hang out right in the spot that I needed to cross to get back.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Every adventure, as you can imagine, and even if you can't,</p>
      <p>always, always without a fail, has some fantastic cherry on top.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Once I begun running away from hunters,</p>
      <p>that were walking my way, and before I knew it...</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I guess I tricked myself into thinking they were following me,</p>
      <p>but get this, there needed up being a small fire, right where they disappeared into the woods.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I was watching them from the safety of my village home,</p>
      <p>through my high powered monoculars.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>My grandpa asked if I knew anything about the fire,</p>
      <p>yup, I snapped back, and reported that the hunters did it, no question about it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>They probably threw a cigarette on the ground,</p>
      <p>and the leaves caught fire.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Another time, I kid you not,</p>
      <p>I ended up resting a bit, beneath an ice sheet!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The small river was high when the top froze,</p>
      <p>but when I got there the river was down to a trickle</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And it had a proper and sturdy,</p>
      <p>roof of ice over it, it was magical!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>One time,</p>
      <p>I was warned to stop expeditioning up to my trees.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Because the wheat filed workers that ran combines up there,</p>
      <p>found some creepy Chupacabra Gollum type creature.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I quickly put my detective hat on,</p>
      <p>sharpened some mean sticks for protection, and mounted an urgent expedition to find more evidence of the creature.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>On my way up there I encountered one of the villagers,</p>
      <p>and he had some more info on what has now become a village legend, creepy talk of the town really.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Apparently they discovered the place where the was hiding,</p>
      <p>and watching the village from.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>They assumed it was some genetic anomaly,</p>
      <p>because it lived in the cold ground by one of the trees up there, and it wasn't man sized...</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>"Oh!",</p>
      <p>I exclaimed suspiciously.</p>
    </div>
