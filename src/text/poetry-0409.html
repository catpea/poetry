      <p>If you ever go to a prestigious show,</p>
      <p>maybe to see a famous philosopher, or a group of amazing speakers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The wisest people there,</p>
      <p>in as far as they care, will only judge you in two ways.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="section">

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>They will judge your spirit,</p>
      <p>by looking at your love for and the magnificence of the person you are with.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And they will judge you by how far you have traveled</p>
      <p>with the aim to make lasting contributions to human kind.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>They won't care about your car, or how much you paid for your outfit,</p>
      <p>they won't care about your schools, or salary, or where you come from.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>They will care about your integrity, weather or not you are a complete person,</p>
      <p>and what you have done with your self awareness in context of the world.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    <div class="section">
      <p>Schools, including High School, College, and University,</p>
      <p>hold us back somehow, even after school... we still move and think wrong.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We move too slow, because of what schools put us through,</p>
      <p>they give us the wrong impression of the world.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We need to read top selling books,</p>
      <p>and schools encourage us to appreciate books in the public domain.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Sherlock Holmes, and Robinson Crusoe are great when you are on a vacation,</p>
      <p>but when it comes to the future of your existence you need books that transform your culture.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Books that help you move from asking about things to actually figuring out how those things work,</p>
      <p>and telling peoples about them in a way that inspires them to understand the world more.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Schools do the opposite, and same for Med School,</p>
      <p>until Med School starts paying you half a million dollars for the fact that your hard earned milestones will make their hospital better, it is not yet worth the mind and time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You are the future, you are not supposed to pay for school,</p>
      <p>you! should be getting paid for it, as that is an investment in the future of human kind.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Paying schools is crazy,</p>
      <p>and only propagates that idiotic and predatory system.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You have to be able to get up on the stage,</p>
      <p>and spend eighteen minutes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FCsyK4aRXQ">passionately speaking about something that matters to you</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>School is not going to teach you that,</p>
      <p>it will only hold you back.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You have to move people,</p>
      <p>not by preparing a speech but by speaking from you heart.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>That is a real test,</p>
      <p>having moved mountains, and being ready to move an audience, and towards wisdom and cheerfulness, hope.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Just as soon as you feel comfortable with independence,</p>
      <p>you have to begin becoming a business person.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Even if all you will ever do,</p>
      <p>is scribble company diagrams.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Becoming a business person is a huge part of growing up,</p>
      <p>there is nothing to be found in being a good student.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>A good business person, or an intellectual,</p>
      <p>will discover all their education as they grow towards their highest aims.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We must integrate knowledge,</p>
      <p>we can't just memorize disconnected facts.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We need a complete and well integrated road forward,</p>
      <p>and we need to move at the right pace, and in the exact sequence that fits us best.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>No one has that curriculum,</p>
      <p>but the person is actually doing the walking.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Accept the responsibility for your own education,</p>
      <p>take to life changing books that move the world forwards towards wisdom, and unity.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Let the culture of all those Authors, Speakers, Mountain Movers,</p>
      <p>merge with your culture, inherit from their works and their thinking.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Do not trust schools with the knowledge that will dictate all the life ahead of you,</p>
      <p>become a well read intellectual, and businessperson... and find a way to help the world grow.</p>
    </div>
