      <p>Did you know, that we can't grow,</p>
      <p>unless our lessons connect together?</p>
      <p>We learn the way we navigate cities.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>If we leap from one city center, to another...</p>
      <p>we will not know, where to go, or what to do.</p>
      <p>None of the roads will make any sense.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>To divide knowledge into subjects,</p>
      <p>and encourage cramming, and memorization,</p>
      <p>and force remembering over understanding.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>That is not Education, or Knowledge.</p>
      <p>We can no more leap between subjects,</p>
      <p>than hobbies, or families.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>What connects two things together,</p>
      <p>is as important as the things themselves.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>We only learn when two connect,</p>
      <p>and, then the two connect to a third one,</p>
      <p>and next one, to no end.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>We need a pleasant memorable,</p>
      <p>unbroken chain of curiosities,</p>
      <p>that we can slide up and down, when need be.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Disconnected snippets,</p>
      <p>that we not know what to do with,</p>
      <p>are not useful to us.</p>
