      <p>We all have to be careful about what we end up believing in,</p>
      <p>and we have to be good to ourselves taking care of our minds and bodies.</p>

      <p>Our greatest flaw,</p>
      <p>is our susceptibility to indoctrination.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We have a tendency,</p>
      <p>to believe whatever it is that we are born into,</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We must get ahead of all that,</p>
      <p>we have to verify, we have to check our beliefs.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We have to make sure that who we become, come our golden age,</p>
      <p>does us justice, and that our world is good to us.</p>

      <p>We have to care about our mind,</p>
      <p>we have to take to self education.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>There is nobody we can trust, with our finest work,</p>
      <p>the content of our character.</p>

      <p>And we have to keep our stress levels to minimum,</p>
      <p>we need our brain to work for us not against us.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>When you look at institutions, and governments,</p>
      <p>do not be disenchanted by how little progress they make.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Instead see that they are just little pebbles,</p>
      <p>where our great stepping stones should be.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Together, we have to build so big,</p>
      <p>that liars will be prevented from thriving in the systems we build.</p>

      <p>As to everything else,</p>
      <p>it is moving in the right direction.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>To make it move faster,</p>
      <p>the world needs more Understanding, more Wisdom, more Greatness.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And that;</p>
      <p>is in your hands.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is the content of character of every generation,</p>
      <p>that influences the world the most.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Countries can only make fast progress,</p>
      <p>when their people aim for Knowledge, Wisdom, and Greatness.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>That is a journey we should all make,</p>
      <p>slowly, cheerfully.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And with the certainty of knowing that,</p>
      <p>this is the most enlightening and healthiest path.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I think this is a big part of growing up,</p>
      <p>both for individuals and Humanity.</p>
