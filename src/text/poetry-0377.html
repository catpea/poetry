      <p>As far as assessment, grades, level of education,</p>
      <p>or even the greatness of your mind, are concerned.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You can only be judged,</p>
      <p>by the legacy you pass onto the future.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>There are no tests that you can take,</p>
      <p>that will say anything meaningful.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>If you get bad grades,</p>
      <p>or fail or drop out.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>None of that matters,</p>
      <p>that is all made up.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>All you are cutting your self from,</p>
      <p>is jobs that have a strong preference,</p>
      <p>that you do not have a life outside of them.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The way people describe it,</p>
      <p>in context of med school for example is:</p>
      <p>"You got to love it."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But you can't do this,</p>
      <p>because life is meant to be lived in balance,</p>
      <p>all of you must progress forward, not just your career.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Remember who you are:</p>
      <p>a Miracle Of The Universe.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And remember what you are meant to become,</p>
      <p>a Great Being.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You have to inspire, educate, enlighten,</p>
      <p>share beautiful wisdom and achievement.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Make lasting and meaningful contributions,</p>
      <p>to what will become history.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You don't need to make big contributions,</p>
      <p>the smallest contributions are often the most powerful.</p>
    </div>

      <p>So, getting a perfect 1600 on that test,</p>
      <p>and giving the senior orator speech at graduation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Is not what it appears to be,</p>
      <p>just remember why that even became a thing you wanted.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You were searching for what to do in life,</p>
      <p>trying to answer "What's next?", or "Then what?".</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>This is still a primitive world,</p>
      <p>a world of supply and demand.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The test, the college, and the job,</p>
      <p>are here to get the maximum out of you at the minimum price.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>For this lifestyle it is preferred that you do not have a life,</p>
      <p>that you wear gray, that matches the cubicle, and that you keep your desk clean.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>People who disagree with this,</p>
      <p>do not realize that they have missed on on promotions, they'll never know.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>This so called Career Lifestyle,</p>
      <p>uses less than 10% of your brain.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>When you are "brain storming" at the meeting,</p>
      <p>you use something like 2%, maybe less.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Outside of tests, college, university, career,</p>
      <p>you exit the tunnel and become an Entrepreneur.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The way that works is,</p>
      <p>you show investors that their investment will make your company make more money.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And they will give you money to make your company grow,</p>
      <p>and take 10% of what you make.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Say you build a company that steadily sells workout music,</p>
      <p>but you only have 10 albums, with $100,000 from investors you can hire musicians, and advertise more.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You now have more albums, more sales,</p>
      <p>and make more money, and you give that 10% back to the investors.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>This is kind of not a bad deal, 10% is not that big,</p>
      <p>and without the investors you would not be making anywhere near the money that you are.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Investors are just people with money, that like spreading odds of success,</p>
      <p>they don't want to invest a lot in one company they invest a little bit in many.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Most of their investments will fail,</p>
      <p>but eventually few of them will hit it big.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Their initial investment of $100,000 which is huge for a tiny start-up,</p>
      <p>will return one hundred million as the little company make their first billion.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The reason why I give you this example in some detail,</p>
      <p>is because this is yet another answer to the "What's next?", or "Then what?" questions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The new answer is, become a business person,</p>
      <p>entrepreneur or founder.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>There is a big difference between tests, college, university, career,</p>
      <p>and entrepreneur.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Because in the first you are told what to learn to become a useful business tool,</p>
      <p>and in the second <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yt6raj-S1M">you choose what to learn and where to go</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>By making choices that fit you, by learning at your own pace,</p>
      <p>and by choosing books that fit your existing knowledge and predispositions, as you continue growing...</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You begin walking a new path,</p>
      <p>and begin specializing in unique talents.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>This will make you a strong and confident business leader,</p>
      <p>with a unique vision towards the future.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And help you build a unique legacy,</p>
      <p>because once you find success, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDgelEJwZoo">you will be able to call to others and show them how you go there</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You are a miracle of the Universe,</p>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxyKNMrhEvY">do not let schools mistreat or trick you</a>.

      <div class="section">
        <p>Do not let anybody try to squeeze you into a cubicle,</p>
        <p>you are meant to become a great being, you are meant to grow in health and in balance.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <p>The world does not need the hardest working you, the most tired and disenchanted you,</p>
        <p>the world needs the best you, the healthiest and the happiest you, the most creative and inventive you.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <p>Live strong, live happy and grow,</p>
        <p>look deeply into the future.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <p>Search for knowledge and wisdom,</p>
        <p>and if you so choose, Greatness too.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <p>And finally, once you reach your golden age,</p>
        <p>take time to help others become more like you, that is an important part of your legacy</p>
      </div>
