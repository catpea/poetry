      <p>A lonely ancient stone bear,</p>
      <p>lives atop the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dom_Turysty_na_%C5%9Al%C4%99%C5%BCy_-_3.jpg">tall</a> and mysterious <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9Al%C4%99%C5%BCa">Mount Ślęża</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>For three thousand years and probably longer,</p>
      <p>it has been seen as a very special place as the mountain is surrounded by flat lands.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Thousands of years ago,</p>
      <p>it was a place where people worshiped the sun.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Some ancient artist decided to build a stone bear up there,</p>
      <p>and so she stands to this day.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>A second bear,</p>
      <p>stands guard at the bottom of the mountain.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Oh the stories,</p>
      <p>they could tell.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The bear,</p>
      <p>is not quite related to the ancient sun worshipers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is of Celtic origin, probably the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boii">Boii Tribe</a> of the Iron Age</p>
      <p>it probably represents the Bear Goddess <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artio">Artiō</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>She sleeps in the winter,</p>
      <p>and awakens come spring.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>She transform into a bear,</p>
      <p>and can ascend to heaven to become a constellation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Artiō is compared to the Greek Goddess Artemis,</p>
      <p>goddess of the wilderness.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And the Roman Goddess Diana, sometimes seen as the Huntress,</p>
      <p>Goddess of the Moon and The Underworld.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>At the end of third grade,</p>
      <p>when school still seemed fun.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The teachers decided to entertain themselves by putting up a play,</p>
      <p>which I found pretty scary.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But, somehow I ended up being the bear,</p>
      <p>my parents made a bear mask for me.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I was so stressed out,</p>
      <p>I forgot to pull it over my face, though I still looked nice.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>If I remember correctly, I think I only had one line,</p>
      <p>I only remember the second part:</p>

      <p>It is hard to be a simple child,</p>
      <p>in a world of mystery, and adventure.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>My earliest adventures,</p>
      <p>took me on little walks along trail tracks.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I explored spiderweb filled bunkers,</p>
      <p>still standing after the war.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Followed well worn grassy paths,</p>
      <p>with Budrys, a cheerful and very noble dog.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Mount Ślęża, and Artiō,</p>
      <p>were always right there, softly covered in mist and mystery at the horizon.</p>
