    </section>

    <section>
      <p>You may need a large metal mug for cooking,</p>
      <p>or a cooking-kit, often it is just better to sharpen a stick and have a sausage.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>You will need a first aid kit,</p>
      <p>duct tape is your friend here,</p>

    <section>
      <p>Matches, Zippo, and zippo lighter fluid,</p>
      <p>here the fluid will double as fire starter,</p>
      <p>and get some fire starter products like wax sticks and candles.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And you will need some para-cord,</p>
      <p>for easily dragging firewood to your camp.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Get an inexpensive tent, there are some that are very light weight,</p>
      <p>but you are laying down on the ground and your back may not like that.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Some people just travel with a lightweight hammock,</p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Raccoons are smart enough to fiddle with your tent zipper until they can get inside,</p>
      <p>so get a tiny luggage padlock and lock the zipper eyelets together.</p>
