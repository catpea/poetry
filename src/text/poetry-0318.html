      <p>I don't remember how I found Whitman's Kosmos,</p>
      <p>as beautiful as the ending is, it is the middle that caught my attention.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>"Who, out of the theory of the earth and of his or her body understands by subtle analogies all other theories,</p>
      <p>The theory of a city, a poem, and of the large politics of these States;"</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I remember maybe Chomsky saying that genes that Apes use for navigation,</p>
      <p>got copied and helped us develop other faculties that rely on now, more abstract, forms of navigation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The thing that makes math useful,</p>
      <p>or string theory stick for that matter, that is shares properties with the Universe.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Two apples and one more apple, make three apples,</p>
      <p>this is not math, math uses numbers, not apples... this is Universe.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Math is something that is a subtle analogy,</p>
      <p>to the basic rules of the universe, the universe that we see with our own eyes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>This idea of understanding things by Subtle Analogy is more than a tool for observations,</p>
      <p>it is a tool that can create as well.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Leonard+Susskind">Leonard Susskind</a> in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z27k9_NP4FU">Must the Universe Contain Consciousness?</a></p>
    <p>does not even make a big deal, or a small deal about thinking by subtle analogy to Biology.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Understanding something we have never encountered before,</p>
      <p>by subtle analogy, to something we already understand, is a powerful tool.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And Knowledge clearly, is a fuel to understanding and inventing things,</p>
      <p>by subtle analogy to what we already know.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is safe to say, that the more we know the faster</p>
      <p>we can learn and understand, create and invent.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Therefore, to read a thousand books,</p>
      <p>does not just mean that a person acquires knowledge of a thousand lifetimes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It means they reach the tipping point,</p>
      <p>required for idea synthesis and become infinitely creative.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Even if the ideas they have are tiny at first,</p>
      <p>they continue adding to them, almost as if they were learning from themselves.</p>
    </div>
