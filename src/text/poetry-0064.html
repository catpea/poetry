      <p>Now is the time,</p>
      <p>it is always the time.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>You are never too old,</p>
      <p>you are never too large.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>But whoever you are,</p>
      <p>You are always too beautiful!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Jogging is a wise teacher,</p>
      <p>it teaches bodybuilding.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>More importantly, it teaches,</p>
      <p>that our bodies are powerful.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>But, they do not adapt as quickly,</p>
      <p>as our fancies strike us.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>There is one fantastic way to jog,</p>
      <p>measure how long you can run.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>And how long you need to rest,</p>
      <p>to run that long again.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Make the jogging number (1 minute)</p>
      <p>and the rest number (2 minutes)</p>
      <p>your friends for the Spring.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Rest 5 times, jog four,</p>
      <p>don't be too hard on yourself.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Jogging is difficult,</p>
      <p>because you should dance first.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Dancing and walking,</p>
      <p>are lovely at making you a Jogger.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>But if you are in a hurry,</p>
      <p>as many joggers are,</p>
      <p>a bit of Rest & Jog Tango will do.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>So, rest, jog, rest jog, rest jog,</p>
      <p>rest jog, and rest.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Don't push yourself too hard,</p>
      <p>but you have to run each day.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Some days, you can just walk - so as long,</p>
      <p>as it is three times longer than your jog.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Above all, be good to yourself,</p>
      <p>because, you are beautiful to me.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>And do not forget that you can put,</p>
      <p>blueberry jam into a huge salad,</p>
      <p>to make a new kind of fruit for health nuts.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>I know you can do it,</p>
      <p>I believe in you, I really do.</p>
