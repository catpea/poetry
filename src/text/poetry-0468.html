      <p>It depends where you start,</p>
      <p>start someplace easy and neat.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ffUHK7o5yI">Modern web</a> is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT0Lh1eYk78">mix of several technologies</a>,</p>
      <p>and each _can_ be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pCNqqUbfI">very overwhelming</a>, not to mention all together.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=programmer+burnout">web is unfortunately tough on all</a>,</p>
      <p>even hardcore programmers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>As a lead programmer, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwbM63-LFD4">you don't actually have to know a programming language</a>,</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=how+to+become+a+program+manager">managing the creation of your program</a>, is <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/categories/programming-tech/web-programming-services/web-application?source=category_filters">far more powerful than writing it yourself</a>.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8K-Rg_7Tbo">Hosting on the web can involve a lot of complexity</a>,</p>
      <p>and you probably don't want to rely on any company providing application-specific services...</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>With the exception of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iox7fr7p5Hc">operating system you pick</a>,</p>
      <p>and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/LinodeCloudHosting">hosting company</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And even with that, you already committed to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsh64rjnRas">owning a web server</a>,</p>
      <p>the moment your server goes online, there will be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pJKBL9x6bY">automated tools scanning it for exploits</a>, and trying to guess the password.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The computers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4imIIKEK5gc">scanning</a> or trying to break into your server, by the way,</p>
      <p>are hacked, they are the ones that the automated hacking programs already broke into.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Any other traffic will be coming from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8pCRMrbSl4">Tor or VPN</a> networks,</p>
      <p>often times the location of the hacked server is obscured.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>There is nothing you can do,</p>
      <p>often there is nobody to care that their server got hacked.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The moment one gets shut down,</p>
      <p>couple more will get hacked elsewhere,</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Unless you want to run a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WUaI2pNiPI">honeypot</a> tracking those servers,</p>
      <p>you probably don't want to program web applications unless it is something big.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWEID0d6wfo">As far as web goes, you may wish to start with serverless functions</a>,</p>
      <p>if you application is small, then you are going to be somewhat worried about performance.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But the serverless pattern is hard to beat,</p>
      <p>when it comes to worrying about growth.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And it is actually a nice way to start programming,</p>
      <p>because you just create simple functions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>These functions are executed as needed by nameless, random servers,</p>
      <p>once you start noticing that you are running out of servers, you simply add more.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>These servers can be though of as workers in your company,</p>
      <p>and during development you will probably only need one.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And one neat thing about those servers is that,</p>
      <p>is that there is nothing special running on them, so you can just reset them.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>All the functions that you and your users need to have executed, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAj7F37SfG8">go into a task queue</a>,</p>
      <p>and then these poor nameless servers, start executing those functions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>On the internet every millisecond counts,</p>
      <p>but it is interesting to have your worker-servers at home just to envision the process.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Normally, I wouldn't mention this, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz0MFOKmmDY">this is how the modern CPU works</a>,</p>
      <p>you need to have multiple workers even in your smallest programs on your own workstation to take advantage of the CPU.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But notice how phone apps use the Phone CPU,</p>
      <p>and it is the worst CPU to use, it is slow, battery powered, and you need it for emergencies, and for answering the phone.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>At the same time, if there was one large company trying to keep up with the processing power needed to make all the apps go,</p>
      <p>they would need a large and complex operation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Apps, that you pay for, burn up your own CPU and battery power,</p>
      <p>they are not web applications, they are resilient, decoupled, distributed.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>They are clearly a success,</p>
      <p>they make the phone more useful.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But as far as complex <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIGSJshYb90">Graphic User Interface</a> applications go,</p>
      <p>put them on the desktop, at least at first.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Even with the crazy restrictions that popular Desktop Operating Systems created,</p>
      <p>the walled gardens, non-free developer networks a Desktop is still a good target.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>For one, when you create a desktop application,</p>
      <p>it is not going to be instantly attacked by hacked computers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And if it is a good idea, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FquNpWdf9vg">HyperCard</a> was,</p>
      <p>you can sell it for a good price.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>When developing for the Desktop should use a base like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YP_nOCO-4Q">electron</a>,</p>
      <p>or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UsGnjPYxLU">NW.js</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The big weakness of desktops,</p>
      <p>is that there are three incompatible operating systems, electron and NW.js, are actually <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWFUSxqMJic">cross platform</a> and repair that problem.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You don't have to start Developing your application User Interface First,</p>
      <p>learning programming relies on good ideas, not just what is possible, but also, what is good.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>For example <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLPiMl8XUKU">Smalltalk</a> has a very consistent user interface that requires very little GUI programming,</p>
      <p>it is a good idea to write the non-GUI core of your program first, at the very least, to make it easily testable.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>If you do like complex architecture, a well thought out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-HGdc8L-7w">Object Oriented Programming</a> language can be useful,</p>
      <p>even better if you use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuWEQsE7Hlo">Behavior Driven Development</a> that describes your program core in a readable subset of English.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>This is a good place to mention <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83v8cdvGfeA">MobX and Redux</a> and similar application state based approaches,</p>
      <p>where high level actions modify a non GUI model of your application.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You shouldn't let programming become complicated, though,</p>
      <p>look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIn5DZU_NoA">Apple's Siri</a>, it is just chat; or filling out forms one line at a time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Siri combined with a program like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzvqSVgc2t4">MUD</a>,</p>
      <p>can start keeping track of context of conversations and learn and become more intelligent.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    <div class="section">
      <p>Finally, I think the best type of a program is one that has two kind of users,</p>
      <p>the end-user that enhance their program by making additional purchases, and plugin-creators that further expand your original program idea.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>This isn't so much about creating something as toxic as in-game-purchases,</p>
      <p>but rather developing the initial features of your program as if you were a third-party content creator.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Giving your program life from inside out,</p>
      <p>all the way back from its most fundamental features.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>This way you can upgrade your program, one board at a time,</p>
      <p>like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVlIZJTwgyQ">Ship of Theseus</a>.</p>
