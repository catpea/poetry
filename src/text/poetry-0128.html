      <p>One late afternoon I hopped on my bicycle to ride the trail,</p>
      <p>and returned with an interesting tale.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>For right where 275 and Michigan meet,</p>
      <p>I found a <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/En5tWm4Z93mmwtZ28">little bicycle path that's really neat</a>.</p>

      <p>It is a huge park that branches out to two more little parks,</p>
      <p>though they are behind peoples houses and pack a lot of dog barks.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>All combined together they make a sweet little quest,</p>
      <p>but make sure to bring plenty of water and rest.</p>

      <p>The main path has little river bridges and lots of really neat sights,</p>
      <p>but be really careful about ticks and mosquitoes bites.</p>

    <section>
      <p>And that northern stretch under the power line, is a sight to see,</p>
      <p>it is just a barren bumpy grassland without a single tree.</p>

      <p>If you keep going north on Haggerty you'll reach Ford,</p>
      <p>and then you can bicycle back to 275 and get back on board.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>But I think the woodland trail is the best because there is a lot of shade,</p>
      <p>I imagine that's why it was made.</p>
