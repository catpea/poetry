      <p>My Friends,</p>
      <p>In this letter I ask you to begin working on building the schools we wish we had,</p>
      <p>by means of creating free and open audio and video lectures.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I am asking you to study what you love, to learn and master what moves your heart,</p>
      <p>and improve and refine the notes and materials until the audio/video recordings can lead a lecture worthy of your students.</p>

    <section>
      <p>I am asking you to rise to the Great Challenge of becoming Real Teachers,</p>
      <p>so that you may help the Younger Generations out of Love, and Inspiration, and Wisdom.</p>
    </section>


    <section>
      <p>The problems of Mass Incarceration, Climate Change, and Voter Confusion,</p>
      <p>are rooted in the broken systems of education that we see today.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>By enabling the new generation of students,</p>
      <p>we will help them with the challenges they will soon face.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>We are going to replace schools and broken/fake education,</p>
      <p>with the lectures we upload to the internet, together.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Wherever possible, work in groups,</p>
      <p>so that no one Great Being must carry the weight of this Great Challenge alone.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I want you to work together, so that the students who will use your materials,</p>
      <p>will fell your friendship and love, hear your laughter, your authenticity, and heroism.</p>

      <p>Schools begun hurting the world by misleading children,</p>
      <p>and pushing them into the false belief that they are not smart enough for good grades.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The truth is that all children are geniuses,</p>
      <p>as Humans, we are all equally gifted.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>However, we all too easily accept authority without question,</p>
      <p>and all too easily fail to perceive reality warped by cultural indoctrination.</p>

    <section>
      <p>Let us begin our work, in the beginning,</p>
      <p>starting where Elementary School ends and Middle School Begins.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>This is the point where education becomes a charade of memorization, grades, and standardized testing,</p>
      <p>this is where we divide Human Knowledge into categories that lose their meaning and purpose.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Let us build our lectures, baby step by baby step,</p>
      <p>following simple human curiosity that lies behind so many of our greatest achievements.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The task at hand is simple,</p>
      <p>but also enormous.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The more join us under the banner of Free and Open Lectures,</p>
      <p>the easier the path to the Real Solutions and Real Results that the future generations require.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Let us build a school in the Public Domain,</p>
      <p>a school that invites all to learn from Audio, Video and Digital Materials.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>A school where there are no grades,</p>
      <p>only visible paths and milestones of proud achievements and joy of learning.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Let us encourage all the participants to expand the lectures under no subject in particular,</p>
      <p>simply what makes best sense for the Human Mind to Grasp.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Let us tile our lecture for what they really are,</p>
      <p>and may they unite many of the old subjects, so that they may be once again be free of borders and overflowing with content.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The world of the future requires real solutions with lasting results to very complex problems,</p>
      <p>let us help the children of today meet that challenge in Knowledge and Wisdom.</p>
