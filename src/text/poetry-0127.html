      <p>When you sense that fear is near,</p>
      <p>begin thinking about all the things you hold dear.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Think about how far you have already grown,</p>
      <p>how much of what you love used to be scary or unknown.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And do not let anyone try to control you with fear,</p>
      <p>they are weak and their mind is already broken and unclear.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Above all, know the weakness of fear,</p>
      <p>all the things in your soul are far more real.</p>

    <section>
      <p>But do not just close your eyes and let it pass,</p>
      <p>turn inward to remember your beauty, strength and class.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Let each time you get scared,</p>
      <p>mark a day where you contemplate.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Think about all the little wisdoms you love,</p>
      <p>and how much more you learned by standing up when push came to shove.</p>
