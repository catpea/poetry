      <p>School is just the best all of the uneducated humanity at the time could agree on,</p>
      <p>it is our first best try, and it was a failure that in its misery will now serve us,</p>
      <p>as a source of wisdom for building the second generation of schools.</p>

      <p>People that made you feel unintelligent, made a mistake out of desperation,</p>
      <p>because they couldn't have know how to teach, because the idea of the classroom,</p>

      <p>crafted for simple and convincing displays of progress, and easy reelection campaigns.</p>

      <p>School was invented as an experiment by Great Self Taught Beings,</p>
      <p>though it is broken, it still serves to keep the Global Level of Knowledge high enough,</p>
      <p>for us to communicate about leaving bad ideas behind, and which are worth keeping.</p>

      <p>We know it will be based on the way the Self Taught learn,</p>

      <p>Let us begin by taking to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,</p>
      <p>and setting it as the Opening Chapter of the New Text Book,</p>
      <p>in recognition that school is directly responsible,</p>
      <p>for the future of Earth and all her Inhabitants.</p>

      <p>May the first lesson, of this first New Text Book,</p>

    <section>
      <p>May it serve as a cautionary tale,</p>
      <p>and as an inspiration to Leadership, clear thinking,</p>
      <p>and always choosing the harder right over the easier wrong.</p>
    </section>
