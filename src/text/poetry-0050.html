      <p>As I woke up this morn,</p>
      <p>I knew my recreational programming schedule will be torn.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>I put on my slippers, and I shuffled down stairs,</p>
      <p>and begun slowly sorting through all my kitchen wares.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>For today, is my Spring Cleaning day,</p>
      <p>and I will have little time to play.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>I wished and washed, and sloshed and swished,</p>
      <p>in the end all my cleaning sponges looked squished.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>To complete my mission, I had to update my fire alarms,</p>
      <p>so I grabbed my ladder, and put tools under my arms.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>My bendy scissors, and my rusty screwdriver</p>
      <p>that looks like I stole it from a scuba diver.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>And climbed, my three little steps,</p>
      <p>all the while flexing my triceps.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>When I finally made it to the top,</p>
      <p>the little screw wouldn't fit, so I got down and poked it with my mop.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>I said, "This a job for 'mah power-tools,</p>
      <p>I need my drill, this ain't no job for fools."</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>I cannot describe to You with what amazing grace,</p>
      <p>I made that hole, and fireproofed my place.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>As I was making my way down,</p>
      <p>I almost felt like I earned a crown.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>But, when I reached the bottom, I found a screw,</p>
      <p>I must have dropped it... it was brand new.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>But! In the end I made it all work,</p>
      <p>and muttered, "Guess, I am not such a dork."</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Now, when I look up and tilt my head,</p>
      <p>I can see it... slowly blinking red.</p>
    </div>
