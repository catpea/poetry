      <p>Before we trust school with our knowledge,</p>
      <p>and our path to wisdom and beyond.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Before we assume that College.</p>
      <p>will open gateways to a job we love.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Before we trust somebody, or something else,</p>
      <p>we must begin learning on our own, and never stop.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>One of the first things we must do as a self aware human being,</p>
      <p>is accept the responsibility for our own education.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>All the other educational things,</p>
      <p>must become a secondary concern.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Furthermore,</p>
      <p>we cannot blindly trust our employers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>They do not exist to help us,</p>
      <p>but for their own profit.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We have to learn to become a business person,</p>
      <p>so that we do not entirely rely on others.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Losing a job must not translate to,</p>
      <p>becoming homeless.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I do not know for sure, but we maybe seeing that schools do as little as possible,</p>
      <p>and employers pay as little as they can get away with.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>One does it for funding,</p>
      <p>and the other for profit maximization.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>On the other hand, self education, and readiness to support oneself</p>
      <p>by launching a smart and small independent business are, wise ideas.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Don't worry, it all takes many many years,</p>
      <p>it is part of our growing up.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Learning slowly at a pace that fits us best,</p>
      <p>as we adventure from one curiosity to another, in a sequence reflecting what we already know.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And slowly considering dozens of ever improving business ideas,</p>
      <p>by dreaming them up from our teenage days on, is very empowering, if not down right stress relieving.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And self education revolves around adventure and narrated books,</p>
      <p>adventure can mean traveling old or great cities, or nature parks, or city libraries and local museums.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is extremely healthy,</p>
      <p>and there is no stress involved.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Plus, being curious about launching a business, or just being mindful of it,</p>
      <p>will call our attention to books about entrepreneurs business strategies, over the course of the years.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Self education and entrepreneurship, is in no way trouble or a burden,</p>
      <p>it is just another friendly talent we learn as we grow - it is good for us.</p>
