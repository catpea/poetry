      <p>Sometimes I race my bicycle in the twilight,</p>
      <p>it is not too dark - there is still plenty of light.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And to be safe, I bring my flashing lamp,</p>
      <p>and ride carefully like a real champ.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>But, oh boy, oh boy, is it nice,</p>
      <p>there are deer, bunnies, and little mice.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Oh, how smell of pine trees mix with smoke from the fireplace,</p>
      <p>it smells do good that I want to stop my race.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Sometimes, I do stop to look at the sun go down,</p>
      <p>but... I have to imagine the horizon as I am in middle of a town.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And hen the sun gets low enough all the clouds light up red,</p>
      <p>finally allowing the darkness to begin to spread.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>That's usually when I turn around,</p>
      <p>but I love the frogs and crickets and the early night sound.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I wish I could capture it and keep it all,</p>
      <p>but all the pictures and videos I take look dull.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I think we should all take time to enjoy these simple treasures,</p>
      <p>as these are some of the life's most magnificent pleasures.</p>
