    <section>
      <p>Time for all of us to rise,</p>
      <p>to fuel that which is greatest within us.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>It is how we change the world with our works,</p>
      <p>that matters the most in the end.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>It is almost certainly a very small book,</p>
      <p>one that will sit along side a smartphone.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And it is a book of answers,</p>
      <p>that helps the children to real life.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Let us open our books</p>
      <p>by undoing burdens:</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>"Whatever trouble brought you to my book, child,</p>
      <p>know that there are few people</p>
      <p>that would have acted differently</p>
      <p>in circumstances similar to yours."</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And then carefully, let us share,</p>
      <p>in the limited number of pages that we have,</p>
      <p>what has moved us the most.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Without our hard earned wisdom,</p>
      <p>they don't really have a chance at not making the same mistakes.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Who else is going to teach them if not us,</p>
      <p>what Socrates said was only meant for the age he grew up in.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>We need to repeat it anew,</p>
      <p>nearer the culture of the children.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>We have to help them understand,</p>
      <p>that old age is a privileged denied to many.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>So as long as we take to living in pursuit if wisdom,</p>
      <p>and it is never to late to start, aging is a good thing.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Let us not have the children start at the same height we stated,</p>
      <p>let us spare them the aches we went through, may our aches count for more.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Let us show the younger generations that we are rising,</p>
      <p>that we are building a better world albeit slowly.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The world can't be replaced,</p>
      <p>it must be transformed.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Just like a ship can't be replaced,</p>
      <p>but can be transformed by updating it, board by board.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Let us show them that part of the meaning of their existence,</p>
      <p>is a lasting legacy of wisdom.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The sooner they start,</p>
      <p>the more beautiful their rise.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And the other part is Happiness,</p>
      <p>out of Wisdom, out of Strength.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The meaning of life comes with Wisdom,</p>
      <p>as our mind becomes more powerful for all the good ideas it gathers.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>We have to help the children to understand,</p>
      <p>that they belong to a Universal Culture, that they are Citizens of the World.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>That all the things that change based on geographic location,</p>
      <p>are but traditions.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Only that which remains regardless of where they are born,</p>
      <p>is their true culture.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>We have to get them to help each other as they grow,</p>
      <p>to reach out to each other across borders.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The borders that dive us,</p>
      <p>borders are just the products of small and primitive minds.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The future belongs to the children,</p>
      <p>not those who gained authority by pretending.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>There is hope for a more just and transparent world,</p>
      <p>but it requires that we all stand in relentless pursuit of wisdom.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>A liar will always win,</p>
      <p>except when it comes to the wise</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The wise will easily recognize the uneducated fool,</p>
      <p>taking on his pleasing shapes.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Let us help the younger generations, to wisdom,</p>
      <p>by telling them about Philosophers and their Love and Pursuit of Wisdom.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Let us pass on only the good ideas,</p>
      <p>and commit the bad ones to history books as cautionary tales.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>A life is a work of art, it paints it self day by day,</p>
      <p>to create a beautiful picture, our legacy.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Life is best lived when what we learned yesterday,</p>
      <p>adds to help us become a little bit wiser today.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The energy and the force for it all comes from</p>
      <p>from watching our contributions help the world grow.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The new generations starting, not at zero,</p>
      <p>but at the heights that we bought them to, by our own deliberate pursuit of wisdom.</p>
    </section>
