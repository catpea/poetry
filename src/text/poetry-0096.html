      <p>Don't just move forward,</p>
      <p>you have to move up!</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Life is too short,</p>
      <p>You are too Noble,</p>
      <p>Truth is too Dear.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Many give away their Time,</p>
      <p>some even give away Trust.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Sometimes, because they are tired,</p>
      <p>because they had enough,</p>
      <p>or had waited long enough.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Giving something of yourself away,</p>
      <p>will not make that other person Nobler.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And you are not supposed to wait,</p>
      <p>in waiting all your life will pass you by.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>You are supposed to learn,</p>
      <p>you are supposed to move,</p>
      <p>you are supposed to shine.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>You will lose your mind if you do noting,</p>
      <p>and You will lose your self, unless you grow up.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>You'll never lose the ability to turn around,</p>
      <p>and try again, it maybe harder if you wait too long...</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>... but in your waiting,</p>
      <p>you'll become tougher too.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>No, there is no point of no return,</p>
      <p>but all those who rise, would agree:</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>"Do it sooner than later".</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Begin, by taking back what you have given away,</p>
      <p>and permanently and meaningfully so, and rise up.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>There is no art to this,</p>
      <p>you just pick yourself up, and go.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>You're going to need running shoes,</p>
      <p>and your first battle will be with Fatigue.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Be good to yourself,</p>
      <p>strive to be better,</p>
      <p>let your body rest enough so it may grow stronger.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And return to point Zero,</p>
      <p>go all the way back.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Of all the noble things within You,</p>
      <p>not a single thing is to be shared unearned.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And listen carefully, to the words spoken to you,</p>
      <p>by inference re-construct that which drives others.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And find the Kindred, and the Kin,</p>
      <p>do not be alone for too long.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Isolation is as bad as Fatigue,</p>
      <p>it is a state of having fallen, and being lost.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>You are To Thrive,</p>
      <p>You are To Grow.</p>
    </section>

    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Keep searching, keep training,</p>
      <p>stay away from hate, and those who fell behind on growing up.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Keep learning,</p>
      <p>keep moving,</p>
      <p>let yourself shine.</p>
    </section>

    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Nothing important in life is found at the foothills,</p>
      <p>you have to get to the mountains, and carry on climbing.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Do not stop,</p>
      <p>and keep moving up.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>As to what it is all for,</p>
      <p>it is to better yourself.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>To rise above yourself to new thoughts,</p>
      <p>and powers, and insights, and observations.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>If you stay at the foothills,</p>
      <p>you will never really know who you truly are.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Never know the extent of your Might,</p>
      <p>your Unbrekability, your Blinding Light.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>If you stay down,</p>
      <p>you will blend with all the new people coming and going.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>You'll never be known, never be recognized,</p>
      <p>you may even become forgotten, your judgment clouded.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>It will be hard to recognize,</p>
      <p>the Kindred from the Foe.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>You must rise up, and find your self,</p>
      <p>so that you may be seen for the Brilliant Being that really are.</p>

    <section>
      <p>Help us learn from you,</p>
      <p>from what you have been through,</p>
      <p>from your Great Battles and Works,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>If you hide,</p>
      <p>the Universe will become darker for it.</p>
