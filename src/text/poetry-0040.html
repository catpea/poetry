      <p>Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Thirty Five.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>I am not sure that the end of quarantine will ever arrive,</p>
      <p>so I am preparing to write enough poetry to fill a hard drive.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>I think I shall begin writing about cats,</p>
      <p>and then complain a bit about bureaucrats.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>When I am done complaining,</p>
      <p>I shall pick something more entertaining.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Like perhaps musing about Lowbrow Art,</p>
      <p>and then carry on babbling about someone smart.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Maybe a Scientist, or a Philosopher like Descartes,</p>
      <p>or maybe a colorful leader like Napoleon Bonaparte.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Then, when, I'll run out of things to babble on,</p>
      <p>I will jump on my bicycle and set off at dawn,</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>I'll bring my notepad and a pen,</p>
      <p>and come up with a new idea,</p>
      <p>every now and then.</p>
    </div>
