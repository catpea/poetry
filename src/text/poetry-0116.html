      <p>Try to imagine yourself born in different places or to different cultures,</p>
      <p>note how you are influenced by all the surrounding factors.</p>

    <section>
      <p>Note, how there are parts of you that never do change,</p>
      <p>that form some kind of a foundation.</p>

      <p>Look towards Nonfiction Books or Audiobooks, Memoirs and Biographies,</p>
      <p>and see what wisdom you can inherit to help you on your own journey forward.</p>

      <p>Allow those parts of you that never seem to change no matter what culture you are born into,</p>
      <p>to expand, and grow upwards.</p>

      <p>See if becoming a Lover of all Wisdom, and All Good Ideas,</p>
      <p>and not merely the culture you were born into, helps you understand more about the Human Condition.</p>
