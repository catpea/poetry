      <p>The distance between Science and Play, between Adventurer and Scientist,</p>
      <p>approaches zero will approach zero in proportion to just how much fun you are having.</p>

      <p>My first independent invention was a CD based Car MP3 player in 1998,</p>
      <p>there were many other mp3 player patents, dating many years back, I didn't invent anything new.</p>

      <p>My second invention about 10 year later, was a freaking star-ship,</p>
      <p>and it was safe to teenagers fly.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>It was a high altitude balloon with a miniature craft that would beam down video and movement of the platform,</p>
      <p>to a trailer down on the ground where the crew would be experiencing all the motion in near real time.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Once the balloon pops it would be possible to the dismay of the FAA, and evey other three letter agancy,</p>
      <p>to attempt to stair it, the kids in the trailer on the ground would be getting real feedback to whatever the heck they were trying to do.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Once someone slams the deploy parachute button,</p>
      <p>the miniature craft would slow its descent, the trailer would shudder.</p>

      <p>My third invention, from just not too far back was a board game,</p>
      <p>but a fascinating one.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Amazon sells see through acrylic padlocks, and deadbolts for locksmith training,</p>
      <p>and I realized that one could create a little game out of them.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Basically the players would have to lock-pick their way through the game,</p>
      <p>they would each receive a little lock picking kit, which is the real deal.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>As a bonus the last door they would have to pick,</p>
      <p>was the door to their own house.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>This would teach the players to find a quality lock,</p>
      <p>and actually help them in real life.</p>

      <p>And just now, I am toying with the extremely CPU intensive post processing of photographs,</p>
      <p>I was just able to bring color to an infrared photo taken in the middle of the night.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>There are no practical applications,</p>
      <p>I am just looking towards astrography, contemplating the milky way.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Toying with a program called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZeroMQ">ZeroMQ</a>,</p>
      <p>it is just meant to send information between programs and commuters,</p>
      <p>but I can also see that it could control a large array of cameras and I am just wondering what that could mean for slow motion,</p>
      <p>super resolution, and things like home made supernovae detection software.</p>

    <section>
      <p>It is all fun and games, I am hardly programming any of this, and it is all just about as unscientific as it can be,</p>
      <p>but it does help with day dreams, having a bold idea, and looking into it, teaches something.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>This kind of exploratory learning, or self education,</p>
      <p>if far more powerful than reading textbooks, or listening to lectures.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Do not be afraid of imagining interesting things,</p>
      <p>take to the microscope, infrared and thermal imaging.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I think self education is the only way to make the world a better place,</p>
      <p>treat school for what it is, and don't let it stand between you and real knowledge, and fun.</p>
