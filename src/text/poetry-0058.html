      <p>While not everything can be planned,</p>
      <p>authenticity and learning go hand in hand.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Some lessons can get pretty tough,</p>
      <p>but will fix us, sure enough.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>When life gets sad or feels no good,</p>
      <p>it may be something you misunderstood.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>And our views will shift,</p>
      <p>and we'll convert that bad into a gift.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Pretenders, can't learn this way,</p>
      <p>always in the dark, be it night or day.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>They walk an alien path,</p>
      <p>darkness and wrath.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>There is nothing there to fix,</p>
      <p>it's all an incomprehensible mix.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>To live on a spectrum opposite of devious,</p>
      <p>makes each day connect with the previous,</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>And as days add up, they make you stronger,</p>
      <p>and your steps travel even longer.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Each day turns into gifts and rewards,</p>
      <p>you stop being played, and create your own chords.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Authenticity is a superpower,</p>
      <p>it will help you rise, and you'll never cower.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Day after day you become more powerful,</p>
      <p>this is how we become truly beautiful.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>It will help you finish what you start,</p>
      <p>and your life, will become, a work of art.</p>
