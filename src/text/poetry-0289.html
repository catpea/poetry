      <p>Rise, to get an eagle eye view,</p>
      <p>because the world belongs to you.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Too many problems come from fantasies,</p>
      <p>there are too many of them to mention.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>So many of them are so miserable,</p>
      <p>that no poem can hold them.</p>

    <section>
      <p>We can only really rise,</p>
      <p>high and above anything and everything.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>We can only really make real decisions,</p>
      <p>once we have a good view of the world.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Until we are certain that we aren't under some influence,</p>
      <p>we can't be certain that our decisions are entirely our own.</p>

    <section>
      <p>Great battles come to all of us,</p>
      <p>be it stress, cancer, cult, poverty, or country.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>We need to be certain that we are fighting the right thing,</p>
      <p>it is crazy for a poor person to steal a car to get out of poverty.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>It is a whole new level of evil to keep a person so poor,</p>
      <p>that they fight the wrong thing, and then send them to prison and slavery.</p>

    <section>
      <p>Nothing, other than reaching out for other lifetimes,</p>
      <p>can help us rise tho this height.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And the way we transfer knowledge between lifetimes,</p>
      <p>is books, memoirs, biographies, stories of adventure, and triumph, and failure.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>All the bad ideas have already been lived, and described, and compressed to wisdom,</p>
      <p>don't let the world stress you out, grab an audio book and figure it all out.</p>

    <section>
      <p>When you are ready,</p>
      <p>perhaps come your golden age.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Allow your autobiographical impulse,</p>
      <p>to take possession of you, and write down what you have learned.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Share with the little ones,</p>
      <p>so that they need not start where you started, but at the height you rose to.</p>
