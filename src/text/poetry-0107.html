      <p>Life shouldn't be about beating your best,</p>
      <p>just as important as rising, is your day of rest.</p>

    <section>
      <p>No matter how important your athletic quest,</p>
      <p>or how upon your arrival you are going to be blessed.</p>

      <p>If you must,</p>
      <p>imagine you are a Bird of Fantastic Plumage, and your bed is a nest.</p>

      <p>Come morning, fling up your messy crest,</p>
      <p>and puff up your chest.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And tweet, about how you are not getting dressed,</p>
      <p>because you are too stressed, and you are having your rest.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And explain to those confused, that you are not speaking in jest,</p>
      <p>make it clear that this is not, a test.</p>

    <section>
      <p>Allow strength to return to you, so that you are at your best,</p>
      <p>tomorrow, or in few days, you'll resume your quest.</p>
