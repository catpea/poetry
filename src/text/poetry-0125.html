      <p>Great Adventures need not take you far,</p>
      <p>and ultimately, wherever you go there you are.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>But still, there <strong>is</strong> something special about new places,</p>
      <p>we see more deeply, and get in good graces.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>I think the kind of adventure, that <strong>really</strong> is the best,</p>
      <p>will make you start keeping a little journal to document your quest.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>When there is time to think about all the things and little bits,</p>
      <p>even the slightest curiosity will bring about new wits.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>So fill all the journal pages, and leave it for later,</p>
      <p>because you never know when a little journal may become something greater.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>It could come as a surprise that this little adventure you took,</p>
      <p>turned you into a Famous Writer and became your first Adventure Book!</p>
