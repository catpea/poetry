    <section>
    <p>We must repair schools,</p>
    <p>and finally put an end to ideas like listen and repeat and short term memorization.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <p>The first and foremost is the elimination of grades,</p>
    <p>which also means elimination of standardized testing.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <p>There cannot be such a thing as a Standard Human,</p>
    <p>with a standard mind, it is very foolish to think that.</p>
    </section>

    <section><hr></section>

    <section>
    <p>The second is the division of subjects,</p>
    <p>and that is no different than browsing the World Encyclopedia.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <p>Eventually, people who arrive at Gene Editing,</p>
    <p>will choose their own path through Biology.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <p>Eventually, those who take to building Software,</p>
    <p>will create a path through languages and concepts that fit them best.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <p>Same for every other subject...</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <p>Mathematics can be studied from an enormous number of starting points,</p>
    <p>from Color Theories, and Music and Sound Processing,</p>
    <p>to 3D Printing, Game and Game Engine Design, Astrobiology, Cryptanalysis and Combinatorial Genomics,</p>
    <p>it is not presented as an aim, but rather a small stepping stone in a familiar context, and thus much more easily mastered.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <p>Once a student displays a long term curiosity for a subject,</p>
    <p>they will choose to be tested and choose to follow industry standards,</p>
    <p>they will also choose an evolving test program to which they themselves may contribute.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <p>As a whole, that creates their own Study Curriculum,</p>
    <p>Curriculum Vitae, Resume and Job Posting.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <p>The student moves at their own pace,</p>
    <p>leaving an open trail that can be reviewed by prospective employers,</p>
    <p>teachers, fellow researchers, and employers willing to pay for their study.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <p>Certain paths can carry a Bounty, or Monetary Tips, Recurring Monetary Encouragement,</p>
    <p>and above all creates a point into which the Government, City or Community, can invest.</p>
    </section>

    <section><hr></section>

    <section>
    <p>This is an Open School where anybody can come,</p>
    <p>where anybody can begin excelling at a subject that they are interested in.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <p>Many may start with traditional subjects like Mathematics,</p>
    <p>but here mathematics is presented with connecting points to various industries, and scholarships.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <p>The software program behind this system will be kept purposefully simple and open,</p>
    <p>it is after-all very similar to World Encyclopedia with a Blockchain for purposes of Scholarships and Path Funding.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <p>The software will discourage disconnected clusters in hopes of bringing Humanity together to a single Truth we can all agree on,</p>
    <p>as this an important requirement for dealing with Elimination of Poverty, Improvement of Education, Repair of Climate, and Prevention of Mass Incarceration.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <p>Let us hope that this school will quickly become a Point of Cultural Convergence on Wisdom and Good Ideas,</p>
    <p>a place for sharing Study Paths, Preservation of Knowledge, and a Fine Exit from Poverty by Means of Self Education and Pursuit of Excellence.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <p>The Nations that Choose to Invest in This School to Help with Scholarship Programs,</p>
    <p>will be investing in nothing less than the very Future of Human Kind.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <p>One Family,</p>
    <p>United In Wisdom.</p>
