      <p>Humanity has a long to-do list,</p>
      <p>we have to cure aging and other diseases.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We have to rebuild the concept of money,</p>
      <p>and make sure nobody is hungry or homeless.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Above all, we have to fix schools,</p>
      <p>because schools prevent problems before they start.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And we have a problem,</p>
      <p>we are susceptible to indoctrination.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We have a tendency to take things for granted,</p>
      <p>and assume whatever we are born into is correct.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>As we grow up to become adults,</p>
      <p>we have to make sure that the little ones are getting a real education.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Honestly,</p>
      <p>that is all we have to do.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>If schools were working for real,</p>
      <p>we would have everything.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We got one job,</p>
      <p>fix schools.</p>

      <p>Everything that went wrong in our lives,</p>
      <p>is rooted in somebody's broken education.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>If we use computers to create individualized education,</p>
      <p>people will stop memorizing and start learning.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We must help students to learn at their own pace, in their own sequence,</p>
      <p>otherwise we are forcing them into acting like they have learned by means of memorization.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    <div class="section">
      <p>People in positions of authority,</p>
      <p>can't be pretending to be educated.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The actions of people who represent or influence others,</p>
      <p>carry long-term consequences.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>If we fix schools, then the world will stop repeating mistakes,</p>
      <p>and everything else is going to be fixed by the graduates.</p>
