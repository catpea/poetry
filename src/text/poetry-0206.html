  <section>
    <p>Elementary Schools are still a Dream,</p>
    <p>perhaps the most beautiful Achievement of Human Kind.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>Before mandatory education people didn't think poor kids could learn,</p>
    <p>people didn't want poor kids to learn.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>But we did it,</p>
    <p>we did it, it worked.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>It will always work,</p>
    <p>we learn to write, to read, numbers.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>And multiplication, here is when teachers make the mistake of memorization,</p>
    <p>where they look down on the ability to create a multiplication table,</p>
    <p>a delayed addition lookup table.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>Here, a new kind of memorization begins,</p>
    <p>the kind that destroy our climate, our health, our very humanity.</p>
  </section>


  <section>
    <hr>
  </section>


  <section>
    <p>The moment, the teacher, says, MEMORIZE,</p>
    <p>they are now working on getting paid.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>This is where school breaks down,</p>
    <p>where it all falls apart.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>In the worst way, now, a lookup table, is a shameful cheat-sheet, it becomes a D+ or a 2+ and it stains,</p>
    <p>and it shows up in College papers, all the papers, all the worthless papers.</p>
  </section>


  <section>
    <hr>
  </section>


  <section>
    <p>And this would be fine, except it stains our minds as well,</p>
    <p>because deep down we believe even in the worst teachers.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>And that belief, in that memorization grade charade,</p>
    <p>digs into us, and books start feeling optional, and math useless.</p>
  </section>


  <section>
    <hr>
  </section>


  <section>
    <p>Children grow up without faith in Education and Knowledge,</p>
    <p>they don't believe in the Power of Wisdom, and Noble Teachers and Guardians.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>They are still geniuses, powerfully smart, but the betterment of Humanity,</p>
    <p>is not the aim, the aim is to prove that they can do whatever it is.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>And we lose a child, a student, and gain something else.</p>
  </section>


  <section>
    <hr>
  </section>


  <section>
    <p>The teachers, sold the world,</p>
    <p>for a small paycheck.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <hr>
  </section>


  <section>
    <p>We can fix this.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>First of all, your grades were nonsense,</p>
    <p>all the things you couldn't memorize well enough were not a judgment of your intelligence,</p>
    <p>it was a judgment of how well you perform circus tricks, how deep your faith in teachers.</p>
  </section>


  <section>
    <hr>
  </section>


  <section>
    <p>You were a Genius,</p>
    <p>we all are, there is no anomaly that grans us magical brains,</p>
    <p>it is a function of NOT MEMORIZING, and looking at how the formulas were invented.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>You master match by studying its history,</p>
    <p>not by memorizing formulas.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>Imagine what would happen to Newton,</p>
    <p>if he only memorized formulas.</p>
  </section>


  <section>
    <hr>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>Imagine reading a foreign storybook that way,</p>
    <p>just memorizing pronunciation of word after word without learning the language first.</p>
  </section>


  <section>

  </section>


  <section>
    <p>The language for Mathematics is not numbers,</p>
    <p>it is love of Universe, of Complexity, search for answers,</p>
    <p>gaining insight into the working of the universe, by subtle analogy to the simplified mechanics behind mathematics.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>It is a lovely, but primitive language that can be brought to life with computers,</p>
    <p>programming, game development, even design.</p>
  </section>


  <section>
    <hr>
  </section>


  <section>
    <p>Past a certain point, people didn't know how to teach,</p>
    <p>so they used memorization, out of desperation.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>Memorization temporarily acts like learning, knowing,</p>
    <p>the effects wear off in days, where knowledge is the foundation of the heights we reach.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>Grades are fake,</p>
    <p>you go tricked,</p>
    <p>sold for a paycheck.</p>
  </section>


  <section>
    <hr>
  </section>


  <section>
    <p>Most of the sciences are learned by studying their history,</p>
    <p>there is no memorization, there is no memorization, there is no memorization.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>Just beautiful little notes, journals, lookup tables,</p>
    <p>including the multiplication table, but also all the tables you invent.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>We are all geniuses,</p>
    <p>some take the easy road, and lie, and trick, and manipulate, and pretend, and try to fake it until they make it.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>Others,</p>
    <p>try to make money, keep bringing a paycheck home, keep lying, get the funding, lower the test standards, process the kids so that all get paid.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>We are vulnerable this way,</p>
    <p>we tend to believe people in authority.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>Even the ones that reject it,</p>
    <p>also reject the idea that they are smart.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>A mind that rejects memorization in favor of integrity, or authenticity,</p>
    <p>shows beauty, shows a love of life.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>Genius is just the beginning,</p>
    <p>past the Sweet Elementary that I know we all love, we only have books.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>There is a lot of Audio Books, a Lot of Mighty Lectures,</p>
    <p>but you have to reach out for that.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>To do that,</p>
    <p>you can't just hear me saying it;</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>You have to believe that You were a Genius All Along,</p>
    <p>it was just some desperate pretenders along the way trying to put food on their table that tricked you.</p>
  </section>


  <section>

  </section>

  <section>
    <p>I know how to help you regain Faith in Education,</p>
    <p>I want you to begin at Concord, Massachusetts, Walden Pond.</p>

  <section>
    <p>I want you, I command you to go see Henry,</p>
    <p>go now it matters not that it is not Spring.</p>

    <p>go see Henry, at the Walden Pond.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>Take a rock, from where you are at right now,</p>
    <p>and add it to the pile that's already there.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>Thoreau, in return will help you slow down,</p>
    <p>and calm down, he will help you come to a speed that's necessary for audio books.</p>

    <p>understand that you are more than a genius,</p>
    <p>you are a creator.</p>

  <section>
    <p>With the Insight granted by Sir Isaac Newton,</p>
    <p>and the Peace and Calm bestowed upon you by Henry David Thoreau.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>You will find your beginning anew,</p>
    <p>you will return to the point where you got tricked into thinking that you are not a genius.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <hr>
  </section>


  <section>
    <p>And finally,</p>
    <p>let your journey begin at Springer Mountain in Georgia, or Mount Katahdin in Maine,</p>
    <p>the others need help, they need to accept the responsibility for their own self education as well.</p>
