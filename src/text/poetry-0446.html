      <p>One of the most beautiful things that you are easily capable of,</p>
      <p>is placing your one hundred page book, into the hands of a young person.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>She may not read the whole thing,</p>
      <p>if you title your book well, she may out think you from that alone.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But the book must exist in the physical world,</p>
      <p>and it has to fit a back pocket.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And it has to contain compressed wisdom,</p>
      <p>not just of your lifetime, but the lifetimes of people that moved _you_.</p>

      <p>The need for your book,</p>
      <p>will come on a terrible day.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>There may not even be time to open it,</p>
      <p>perhaps the Universe will only allow for having it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Perhaps it is the promise of the book,</p>
      <p>not the content within that will be needed.</p>

      <p>Your self education:</p>
      <p>the most trustworthy kind of education will be required for your wisdom.</p>

      <p>And your wisdom is a prerequisite for your Greatness,</p>
      <p>the greatness of your mind, the greatness of your vision.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You will have to part the time,</p>
      <p>and make room in your life to write your little red book.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Not a wrung of your ladder should ever be fake,</p>
      <p>as _you_ will be your own judge.</p>

      <p>You will have to mend all the mistakes,</p>
      <p>learn from them, and understand their origins.</p>

      <p>In order to prevent them from making mistakes,</p>
      <p>you will have to trace the roots of yours.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Part of your self-forgiveness and self-love,</p>
      <p>will drive you here too.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Most people who cannot help but to blame themselves,</p>
      <p>do so because they don't dare to understand that they never stood a chance.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Some of my bullies will never forgive themselves,</p>
      <p>even though I already knew back then it was their fathers, they fear to trace their mistakes to the origin.</p>

      <p>Let me tell you about you book,</p>
      <p>the universe will arrange it so that, most of the time the pages will be read in the same weather that you wrote them in.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You, you, are going to preserve the original notes,</p>
      <p>and publish them as they were, when you were writing them on The Trail.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Including the last few notes,</p>
      <p>written on receipts and scraps of paper.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The drops of rain that stain the scraps as you are desperately capturing some of your finest thoughts,</p>
      <p>will be kissed by the rain again, sometimes on the same Trail even, though now in a leather bound miniature pocket book that you published.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Not all kisses will fall from the sky,</p>
      <p>some will come from the life of your reader, others from your reader connecting with you, across two centuries and a half.</p>

      <p>Your spirit,</p>
      <p>reawakened countless times.</p>

      <p>you are also never too young to retire, and begin your quest for Greatness.</p>

      <p>Listen, hear me,</p>
      <p>you are meant to become a Great Being.</p>
