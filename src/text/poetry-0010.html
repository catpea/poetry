    <div class="section">
      <p>Out of the night that covers me,</p>
      <p>Black as the Pit from pole to pole,</p>
      <p>I thank whatever gods may be</p>
      <p>For my unconquerable soul.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>In the fell clutch of circumstance</p>
      <p>I have not winced nor cried aloud.</p>
      <p>Under the bludgeonings of chance</p>
      <p>My head is bloody, but unbowed.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Beyond this place of wrath and tears</p>
      <p>Looms but the Horror of the shade,</p>
      <p>And yet the menace of the years</p>
      <p>Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>It matters not how strait the gate,</p>
      <p>How charged with punishments the scroll.</p>
      <p>I am the master of my fate:</p>
      <p>I am the captain of my soul.</p>
    </div>
