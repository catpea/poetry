      <p>Understanding our world seems difficult,</p>
      <p>when you only try to integrate the broken things.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The broken hings are mere symptoms,</p>
      <p>and you ought to look to the many root causes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Furthermore, once the world understands to practice crime prevention,</p>
      <p>or as it should be called, compassion, reason, and foresight...</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Great many of the root causes,</p>
      <p>will simply cease to exist.</p>

      <p>Prevention is about creating flourishing communities,</p>
      <p>equipped with real schools, and community angel funds that can only benefit everyone.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is communities, not cheap government schools that should build strong exchange programs with their sibling cities,</p>
      <p>there is no better education then a few years spent in multiple countries abroad.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>A year Japan learning Tea Ceremonies, The Art Of Sushi,</p>
      <p>learning about calligraphy, and painting with watercolors.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>A year in Australia, learning about the Aboriginal Culture, Music and Arts,</p>
      <p>learning how to surf and dive, and care for the The Great Barrier Reef.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>A year in Europe, studying famous architecture, visiting beautiful libraries,</p>
      <p>learning languages, and looking into our ancient past.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>As well as the other way around where students from Europe, Australia and Japan,</p>
      <p>learn to create Modern Art in New Your or Los Angeles, or how to take care of horses in Texas, or mantes in Florida.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>This is a wonderful and eye opening education that brings the world together,</p>
      <p>and shows how many different cultures there are, expanding one's own culture.</p>

      <p>When it ceases to grow, like a flower,</p>
      <p>the world ceases to have a meaning for all the terrible things that go unchanged or unchallenged.</p>

      <p>Politics will forever be a magnet for the mad and corrupt,</p>
      <p>the World can only grow inside out, it is "We The People", not "Them The Politicians".</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We aren't to wait for schools that politicians barely arrange for,</p>
      <p>we are to build them, and improve them to no end.</p>

      <p>Poverty will not be eliminated by waiting for the worlds governments to invent new laws,</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Adults must pay more attention when listening to the future generations,</p>
      <p>as they are often wiser.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>A troublemaker who cannot help oneself but to tag the neighborhood with colorful graffiti,</p>
      <p>is an artist, who is only short of an expansive frame and canvas, and could build a business selling beautiful art.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>When kids get bad grades in school it becomes a toxic environment for them,</p>
      <p>they get too stressed out; by what becomes a prison or a concentration camp that-they-must-go-to or be beaten at home, or not allowed to return.</p>

      <p>and building more powerful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0NfRN730ts">Start-up Accelerators</a>.</p>
