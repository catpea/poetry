    <section>
      <p>I wrote a new workout program, Holy Molly,</p>
      <p>surely this will turn out to be another folly.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>It will make me jog fast like lightening,</p>
      <p>I think a lot of people will find my wobbles very frightening.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Certainly it will make me dance in the streets,</p>
      <p>as I shuffle and jog to my favorite beats.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And it already crossed my mind to jog with a tail,</p>
      <p>but I don't want all the quarantined people to go even more pale.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I just executed the program and it said: play-list done,</p>
      <p>so I am already stretching my drumsticks for the run.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The play-list is several hours long,</p>
      <p>it will surely make me very strong.</p>
