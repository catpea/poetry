      <p>Each lesson must add to the next one,</p>
      <p>we hardly need to push ourselves.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>It sooo important that you start with something you like,</p>
      <p>it can be anything flying kites, planting flowers, feeding squirrels.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>There area always extras that come alongside,</p>
      <p>and they change everything.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Flying kites, and photography will take you to droneography, possibly astrophotography,</p>
      <p>maybe model building, drone building, custom electronics, satellite engineering.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Planting flowers can steal you away to South America,</p>
      <p>you could be setting up solar or mesh networks for Yawanawa.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I think that the only happy thing that feeding squirrels leads to is more squirrels,</p>
      <p>but perhaps you could become the first person to domesticate them, and sell them as a mini kittens.</p>

      <p>Memorizing formulas is very much the opposite of education,</p>
      <p>it is such an important lesson to be able to freely see relationships in formulas.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>A simple formula can capture mountains of fascinating research,</p>
      <p>sometimes formulas leave out important extras that lead to even more curiosities.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>One example that comes to mind is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law">Ohm's Law</a>,</p>
      <p>you can use the little thing to calculate what resistor you need to light up a little LED light.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Basically, if you have a 9 volt battery, and a little LED light or diode,</p>
      <p>you can't connect the two together because the 9V battery will burn out your 2.3V lamp.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>So you use the Ohms Law to figure out how much resistance you need to put between the battery and the LED,</p>
      <p>then you find a matching resistor in your goodie bag, and voila, you now have a night light.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Same applies to stepper motors, which are useful in creating custom 3D printers,</p>
      <p>you put a resistor on the line as not to damage expensive components.</p>
    </section>

    <section>

    <section>
      <p>You see what the problem is, of course,</p>
      <p>in schools, they don't teach by means of practical applications.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>They teach by abstract means, and for questionable purposes,</p>
      <p>which makes for a curriculum so baffling that we might as well skip it by memorizing it.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>If teachers gave you a 9V battery, and an LED light, and a box of resistors,</p>
      <p>and begun teaching mathematics with Love, Passion, Admiration, Fascination, we could trust organized education.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>But they don't do that,</p>
      <p>we have to do that.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And the curriculum we should follow is already within us,</p>
      <p>it is all those little things we are interested in.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And like teachers, parents may not be able to understand us,</p>
      <p>they won't know how important is to go from LEGO to LEGO Techinc, and then our first breadboard.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>See it is all up to us, we have to keep hooping amongst our curiosities to make our way towards wisdom,</p>
      <p>so that we can become creators, inventors, dreamers, and thinkers.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And then come our retirement, we'll be surely granted an opportunity to become the teachers we wished we had,</p>
      <p>and write and teach, and with love, and passion, and admiration, and fascination that we once needed.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>It is the only way the world can grow,</p>
      <p>and there is much growing up ahead of us.</p>
