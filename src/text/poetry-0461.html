      <p>The future is coming,</p>
      <p>and you have to help to shape it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You will be in your mid 80s,</p>
      <p>when you pause to look around.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You do not want to see a sad world,</p>
      <p>that you wish you could have fixed somehow.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The elder you, should witness brilliance,</p>
      <p>and see nothing less than, perfect hope.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>There is a fine and fair limit,</p>
      <p>to how far a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRR3Mo4noU">Hero</a> should aim.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And the best of that,</p>
      <p>is sharing of your wisdom.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You have to live courageously,</p>
      <p>to get at that wisdom.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But then you also have to pass it on,</p>
      <p>at the very least, so that the elder you has no regrets.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Of course, you can't force someone read a book,</p>
      <p>but you can create one that people will want to read.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And it has to be, or should be, a lot more,</p>
      <p>than just a book of wisdom.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The bulk of your sharing,</p>
      <p>is best captured on audio.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>So that you feelings,</p>
      <p>go along with your text.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And because people should be able to take you on adventures,</p>
      <p>and you can't expect them to watch a video or a lecture.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>As, they will probably need to watch,</p>
      <p>where they are going.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But you _can_ trust them to hear you,</p>
      <p>not just listen, but hear you.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is difficult to formulate something,</p>
      <p>that enriches that other person.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>That enables them to go further,</p>
      <p>they will want to hear real ideas.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Ideas from real life,</p>
      <p>people won't always have time for abstract ideas.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Even wisdom from true life,</p>
      <p>can get a bit dry from time to time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But there is,</p>
      <p>something.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And that something is,</p>
      <p>gentle and sophisticated humor.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And there is a way to do it,</p>
      <p>that is really authentic.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Here is,</p>
      <p>how you sprinkle some delicate humor into your works.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Go to an otherwise ordinary place,</p>
      <p>although somewhere interesting.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And begin sharing your ideas,</p>
      <p>_while_ letting the place that you are in, speak.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Maybe, you'll set off for London,</p>
      <p>Westminster Abbey.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>To see Sir Newton,</p>
      <p>and sit somewhere, notepad in hand.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And just kind of watch,</p>
      <p>for interesting things.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    <div class="section">
      <p>It could be a lovely couple that comes around,</p>
      <p>though adorably old fashioned.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And you'll be able to describe their fidgeting,</p>
      <p>or guess what their days maybe like.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Or where they came from,</p>
      <p>or _when_... oooooohOOOhhhh.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It could be,</p>
      <p>a nerdy person.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Who like you,</p>
      <p>came to pay respects to Sir Newton.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Though dressed impeccably well,</p>
      <p>you'd notice the cross-bone cuff links.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Nerd! you'd scribble in your journal,</p>
      <p>and underline it twice!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Cross bones,</p>
      <p>are Sir Newton's coat of arms.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And here you'd spend a page an a half,</p>
      <p>analyzing the young lady's scientific interests.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Could it be Optiks,</p>
      <p>perhaps Astrography?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Could it be something as simple,</p>
      <p>as Gravitation and Orbital Dynamics.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Calculus,</p>
      <p>Generative Art, maybe, probably!?</p>

      <p>If you were to visit,</p>

      <p>Perch upon their resting place,</p>
      <p>and scribble lovely observations and quips.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You would create a book,</p>

      <p>The best kind of a school,</p>
