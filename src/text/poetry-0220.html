      <p>Once, late at night,</p>
      <p>I was prancing in the moonlight.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Marching through the woodlands of Ludington State Park,</p>
      <p>and I must say, even with the moonlight the woods remained dark.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>There was an occasional bark or a howl,</p>
      <p>but it didn't get scary till I heard an owl.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>"Hoot, hoot" - she said,</p>
      <p>"I am about to swoop down and peck y'all dead."</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>"No, thank you Dear Madam", I sweetly replied,</p>
      <p>as I hastened my step and lengthened my stride.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>"Hoot, hoot" - I heard,</p>
      <p>to which I yelled now at a gallop "I ain't afraid of no bird."</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>"Hoot, hoot" - she added, and now I was running forward with all the pep,</p>
      <p>squirting urine at every step.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And finally we jumped out into a moonlit clearing,</p>
      <p>and she made a 180, perched upon a tree leering.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I was lucky, and my camp was near,</p>
      <p>legend is that she's still out there filling the woods with fear.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>So if if you're ever out there, and hear a hoot,</p>
      <p>better grab onto your butt, and scoot.</p>
