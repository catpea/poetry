      <p>Captain's Log: Day Fifteen of Quarantine,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Squirrels continue being mean.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>They just aren't very keen, on the idea,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>that their theft gave them diarrhea.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I know not what to do,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Darn Squirrels! that Trailmix was not for you!</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Maybe someday we'll move on,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>come a sunny day, carry on.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>But today, is not that day,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>it's just Tuesday.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>This is getting out of control,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I don't want to be a poet anymore!</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I just wanted to feed the creatures I adore.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Not write strange rhymes out the front door.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I must stop rhyming,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>this is not the right timing.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I feel like I've lost control,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>spiraling down a Squirrel Hole.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I swear I am not like this in real life... I can change!</p>
