      <p>Sure, racing my bicycle is nice late in the day,</p>
      <p>but at the end I have to use a flashlight to find my way.</p>

      <p>that I have to switch to sunglasses to continue enjoying the view.</p>

      <p>and a hawk probably waiting around for her babies to hatch.</p>

      <p>what do you love more, evening sunsets or the sunlit dew?</p>
