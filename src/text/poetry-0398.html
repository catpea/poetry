      <p>Pretty frequently there comes a moment,</p>
      <p>that can define future's past.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>They are always simple moments,</p>
      <p>and always revolve around simple things.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Mr. Jobs liked to keep his house empty of useless things,</p>
      <p>this helped him think about what items exist in every home.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Not emerging trends like the computer or mp3 player,</p>
      <p>but the well established ones that haven't changed in a long time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Some trends fade away, the mp3 player is a niche item now,</p>
      <p>some self destruct, the Mac is moving away from the x86 processors now.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Some linger, unbreakably, unmovingly,</p>
      <p>like the Linux Phone.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Many like the Linux phone, are misunderstood, Linux phones should not be about apps,</p>
      <p>they need a conversational interface to the Linux System, the phone needs to replace apps with Automation and Programming.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Programming is the future,</p>
      <p>and it is not as hard as people make it out to be.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And it is just as worth the while to try to bring something back, or do it right,</p>
      <p>as it is to begin a new revolution.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But there is something nice about being the first to start something,</p>
      <p>for one you get to watch it grow.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The Music Revolution has already somewhat begun,</p>
      <p>but it does not quite yet, get it self.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>There is but a single reasonable program <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u1aQdG5Nrk">Tone.js</a>,</p>
      <p>where there should be hundreds.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The firs person to program Tone.js right,</p>
      <p>will become known as the Mother or Father of what will then become modern music.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>This is big,</p>
      <p>it will make the music that we know today sound like soulless banging.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Right now, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1m0aX9Lpts">Sam Aaron</a>,</p>
      <p>is blazing the trail, and the sound of his music is in deed made unique by his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TK1mBqKvIyU">SonicPI</a> instrument.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>What I am talking about is greater than Live Music,</p>
      <p>I am talking about using programming languages to code entire Albums of Songs.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I am talking about abandoning Digital Audio Workstations and Graphic User Interfaces,</p>
      <p>and bravely venturing into the world of programming-language-driven Music Composition.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is a good idea to use the language of the web for this,</p>
      <p>if you are going to learn a programming language <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Learn+JavaScript">learn JavaScript</a></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Before we go on, I want you to hear the sound of the previous generation of music,</p>
      <p>search the web for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Js-dxl1BKc">Kraftwerk Interview Ralf HÃ¼tter BBC2 England</a>,</p>
      <p>and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDgelEJwZoo">Giorgio Moroder - live at Lowlands 2019</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Begin learning how to use Tone.js perhaps with a focus on using pre-recorded samples at first,</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBQef0fs-_Q">you can build your own Live Performance Environment like Mr. Aaron did</a>, but think of songs as stand alone programs.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Instead of trying to bend languages to your will or desire,</p>
      <p>learn to bend yourself, and use the bare bones and existing API at your disposal.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Learn to merge Music with what is already at your disposal,</p>
      <p>do not try to bend the spoon.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Invent your style,</p>
      <p>begin publishing your music as computer programs, perhaps on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/">github</a>, or similar.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And understand that this is your time,</p>
      <p>that you are the new generation of Kraftwerk and Giorgio Moroder, that you are the future.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You are exactly where Techno begun,</p>
      <p>at the cusp of a new genre.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>If you can do it, with purest of JavaScript and API so that others don't have to learn new things,</p>
      <p>and keep your music free and open under an <a href="https://choosealicense.com/">Open Source License</a> so that your music can spread.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Yours is the future,</p>
      <p>and you will become an inspiration for countless many, for eons to come.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>May your works become a treasure of equal proportions to Kraftwerk and Giorgio Moroder...</p>
      <p>"Begin at the beginning, and go on till you come to the end: then stop."</p>
