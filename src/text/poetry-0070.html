      <p>Wherever I went, Friday magically followed,</p>
      <p>there always seem to have been a tree that was hollowed,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And the moment I looked at food,</p>
      <p>he knew, dinner was going to be good.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Wherever the Raccoons came out at night,</p>
      <p>Friday, was always there, my Fat Spirit Guide.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>
        <!-- Keys -->
      </p>
      <p>Over at Little Torch Key, at Veterans Beach, with easy access to water,</p>
      <p>he lived up a Palm Tree, with his Furry Wife and Tiny Daughter,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Once I got lonely, and threw a little Tortilla all the way up there,</p>
      <p>he popped up, and it looked like he smiled - I swear.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>
        <!-- Jack Pine -->
      </p>
      <p>Over at Ludington State Park, at the Jack Pine Hike-in Campground,</p>
      <p>I woke up at 3 am, hearing a strange sound.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>He was trying to pull out my hamburger buns,</p>
      <p>probably to feed all his furry sons.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The bag was tied, up in a tree,</p>
      <p>nothing could stop him - Because he was free.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I got out of my tent, and delivered his late night bite,</p>
      <p>by tossing it into my cranky neighbor's camp site.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>
        <!-- Nordhouse -->
      </p>
      <p>The whole woodland family, knew that eventually I had to go back,</p>
      <p>Friday left a little footprint on my pillow, to help me pack.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I was staying up in the trees, on top of ancient dunes,</p>
      <p>the only light was that of stars, and the moon's.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I called them [Nordhouse Skylands][1],</p>
      <p>but, if you go out there, be ready for his smart little hands,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Bring a travel lock to secure the zippers on your tent,</p>
      <p>and remember, Friday loves you as friend, he means no ill intent.</p>

    <section>
      <p>My Dear Readers, we may each need a few weeks of Wilderness in our life,</p>
      <p>so start slowly packing, buy a backpack, bug spray, and a knife,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And just keep your adventure pack by the door,</p>
      <p>if life ever gets you down, smile! and head for that Lake Michigan shore.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>You can park at the [Nurnberg Trailhead][2],</p>
      <p>and don't forget to bring a little bit of stinky cheese,</p>
      <p>and piece of stale bread.</p>
