      <p>"He was given a corn seed and told to plant it.</p>
      <p>Just as the stalk was beginning to grow, the young warrior would jump over the small stalk many, many times.</p>
      <p>Each day the stalk would grow; each day the child would jump.</p>
      <p>Soon the stalk was higher than the child's head, but that wouldn't stop him.</p>
      <p>Finally, if he failed to clear the stalk, he would be given a new seed and would begin over.</p>
      <p>Eventually, there was no stalk that the young ninja could not leap over."</p>

      <p>An endurance based workout,</p>
      <p>is about constantly pushing your body to adapt and use energy reserves.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Endurance workouts,</p>
      <p>are rooted in gradually increasing complexity.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>If your exercise is always the same,</p>
      <p>you can't say that you are increasing your endurance.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>If you are choking yourself, crushing yourself with overwhelming weights,</p>
      <p>you are not increasing your endurance efficiently.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Above all,</p>
      <p>in a proper endurance workout...</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You are always sweating,</p>
      <p>and that means you are losing electrolytes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You must replenish those,</p>
      <p>or you will start getting dehydration headaches.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is easier to prevent dehydration,</p>
      <p>than to treat it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>According to Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweat#Composition" title="Sweat Contents">sweat contains</a>,</p>
      <p>sodium (0.9 gram/liter), potassium (0.2 g/L), calcium (0.015 g/L), and magnesium (0.0013 g/L).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>This will vary, some say greatly, and there are tests that you can perform,</p>
      <p>by wearing a patch during a workout and then analyzing the minerals absorbed by the patch.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Search the internet for "<a href="https://mashable.com/article/gatorade-gx-sweat-patch-review/">The Gatorade Gx Sweat Patch was weird, neat, and ultimately kind of pointless</a>",</p>
      <p>and note that there are two more links on the bottom to the <a href="https://www.levelen.com/shop/sweat-test/?attribute_sweat-testing-options=Endurance%2FMultiSport+%2820%25+discount%29">$200 LEVELENâ„¢ Athlete Sweat Test Kit</a>,</p>
      <p>and the <a href="https://www.mx3diagnostics.com/products/sweat-sodium-test">$1,000 MX3 Sweat Sodium Test</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I suspect that it would take several $50 patches to establish a decent baseline,</p>
      <p>if you have a stable exercise, in a climate controlled gym.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>If it gets warmer and/or more humid outside, you body will try to cool it self more,</p>
      <p>if you push yourself harder everyday then your readings may fluctuate.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But you should be aware of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_rehydration_solution">Oral Rehydration Therapy</a>,</p>
      <p>and the fact that the use of homemade solutions has not been well studied.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And you have to be careful,</p>
      <p>because <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04er8Y2O5wo">Overhydration is just as dangerous, if not more dangerous than Dehydration</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You see there is no perfect formula here,</p>
      <p>the only way to do this right is to have a competent professional monitor you daily to create a proper profile.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But, headaches are a sign that you are doing something wrong,</p>
      <p>and the color of your urine may hint if you are dehydrated or not.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And drinking empty water,</p>
      <p>is probably not optimal, you want to have some electrolytes in there, but not too much.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Keep track of how much water you lose during your exercise by weighting yourself before an after,</p>
      <p>make sure to account for bathroom trips, water intake, wet clothes, and heavy shoes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Then make sure to drink enough to replace that lost weight,</p>
      <p>in a reasonable amount of time.</p>
    </div>

      <p>Be careful and wise,</p>
      <p>as it is possible to get ill from exercise.</p>

      <p>Endurance training is not just about triathlons,</p>
      <p>it can be as unique as walking the Appalachian Trail and even the Western States 100 route, that Ultras run during a proper race.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It can be as unique as dancing,</p>
      <p>your training must match where you are, without hurting or stopping you, and must help you become healthier.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Endurance training isn't about how far or fast you are going,</p>
      <p>it is about whether or not it is helping your body become stronger and healthier.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>An endurance race is a strange concept,</p>
      <p>we should not push our bodies to a breaking point, we have to be kind to ourselves.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We need to *slowly* progress forward at our own natural pace,</p>
      <p>there is no glory in becoming ill from exercise, being healthy is the only reward that truly mattes.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>My personal recommendation is dancing at your local gym,</p>
      <p>it is easy on the knees, and provides all the bored people pretending to work out with entertainment.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And I recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Shuffle+Dancing+Tutorial">shuffle dancing</a>,</p>
      <p>you'll never have a bad or boring workout, all shuffle dance workouts are pure joy and cheerfulness.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>When people laugh they are not laughing at you,</p>
      <p>they are either laughing at the strange world we live in, or are laughing with you.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Focus on gaining endurance,</p>
      <p>and enjoy being cheerful and healthy.</p>
