      <p>Above all, begin paying attention to your mental well being,</p>
      <p>whatever is causing you harm, get away from it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>If you think you can't get away from it,</p>
      <p>then find a relative that will take you in.</p>

      <p>If you don't have relatives,</p>
      <p>then you will have to talk to your best friend's parents.</p>

      <p>Please allow me to make a note here, I'll make it brief,</p>
      <p>people are stressed out by fake education, more and more drugs are becoming accessible.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Furthermore, there maybe schools that in their evil will attempt to diagnose people with states of mind that woudn't exist,</p>
      <p>if it wasn't for the insanity of school.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Sir Ken Robinson, called unusually high number of prescriptions for ADHD a sign of a "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCbdS4hSa0s&t=2195">A Fictitious Epidemic</a>",</p>
      <p>and fake schools will cause depression in a healthy mind, that is how it works,</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>If schools start medicating the kids they depressed,</p>
      <p>then even if you want school, get out, get out as fast as you can.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And remember liars are never obvious,</p>
      <p>liars always live in the twilight, there will be no proof, no evidence, just better grades and better profits.</p>

      <p>number two, is somewhat related, especially if you are in middle school or high school.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The first thing you need is an upgrade on you view of the world,</p>
      <p>the way you inherit a more sophisticated intellectual culture is Audio Books.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>They are not free,</p>
      <p>they should be free for people under 21.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>There is no one book, it will take over a hundred Audio Books,</p>
      <p>- and you know this, this one is not easy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>With a hundred books, you will create a self-balancing view of the world,</p>
      <p>and in the process inherit character traits from many of your favorite authors.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Intellectual Inheritance,</p>
      <p>is just another way of saying growing up by reading books.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>This is one of the reasons why you need a safe place, a safe space,</p>
      <p>so that you may grow up, uninterrupted by things that are not worthy of you.</p>
    </div>

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>There is one sure way to accelerate your intellectual growth,</p>
      <p>but you need three more friends, at least, and you need to be in your 20s or up.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>An that is taking to the trails,</p>
      <p>don't do this alone, please.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>In United States we have The Appalachian Trail,</p>
      <p>and The Pacific Crest Trail.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Bring your Audiobooks, Bear Spray, and an Air Horn (bears don't like loud sounds),</p>
      <p>especially if it is four horns going off at the same time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Ignore people that say you don't need the horn,</p>
      <p>just activate it until they walk away.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Bring your journal,</p>
      <p>and grow.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The biggest problems you face when you are young,</p>
      <p>is a smaller grasp of self awareness.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>This is a function of our brain still growing,</p>
      <p>and the genetic predispositions to follow orders, to follow what your teachers tell you for example.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You are also building a view of the world,</p>
      <p>and stuff that isn't real is polluting it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>So, schools are forcing you into memorization, and each semester you have little to show for it,</p>
      <p>especially if you ask yourself: "What if I just spent five months learning how to use a Digital Audio Workstation?"</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You would be able to compose music, probably in just a week,</p>
      <p>by the fifth month you would be publishing your second album on bandcamp, and with some advertising, you could make probably more than a $100 a month.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Even so, you tell yourself, schools are important,</p>
      <p>I need schools, because schools get me to college, and perhaps med school.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You probably don't go as far as pondering the $241,600 average unforgivable student loan debt,</p>
      <p>because you can just pay it off after you get the job.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>This is why you need a hundred of those Audio Books,</p>
      <p>if you want to be a doctor, then in your first hundred books ten will be about becoming one, and a couple about the regrets.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But it is more than just shining light on your career,</p>
      <p>it is about shining light on the way you make choices.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You can't jump forward,</p>
      <p>you have to move precisely deliberately.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You have to start in High School to be a Doctor,</p>
      <p>you have to love it, it has to call to you, you may do part time at a veterinary clinic, and maybe work at a retirement home.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Just waiting for Med School to make you a Doctor is not enough,</p>
      <p>you have to love making your way there, it has to inspire you, fuel you, it has to make you happy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Self awareness means that you know where you are,</p>
      <p>and you know a clear and stable path towards the future.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>In terms of becoming a Doctor, everything that is covered in the first two years of med school,</p>
      <p>you have to cover on your own in the first two years of high school, just as a function of curiosity.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Something in you has to ask, what is MCAT and MLE about... anyways?</p>
      <p>and then you go shopping for a microscope, and might as well pick up a stethoscope and take interest in the heath of your gerbil, or cat.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>In other words, in terms of becoming a Doctor, memorization is required,</p>
      <p>even though it is not effective, and pretty stupid.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And if you take to using what you memorized without double checking,</p>
      <p>then you will get in trouble.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Just as a side-note, the right way of doing this,</p>
      <p>is not to memorize, but to love so many things about the field that you immediately absorb new information.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Sometimes with tears in your eyes as you deep down know you made a huge breakthrough,</p>
      <p>which means you don't need to memorize it, and will never forget it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And sometimes with passionate anger, at all the idiots that made it too confusing,</p>
      <p>because they clearly didn't know what they were taking about.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>In terms of a more open future,</p>
      <p>where we just say to ourselves I'll just get a good job after I graduate college.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is a different story, because now you are looking at $32,000 to $50,000 in debt,</p>
      <p>and memorizing things that you will forget when you start your job.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You know when Police stops you, and ask you "Do you know what you did wrong?",</p>
      <p>to get you to admit to whatever it is, to make their job easier, and a fool out of you.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Jobs do the same thing they will say Entry Position, Experience Required,</p>
      <p>so that during the interview, they can say "we can't pay you that much, because you do not have the experience we asked for".</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>In this situation, Self Awareness translates to asking:</p>
      <p>"do I want to work for such a company?"</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Do you want to work for a company,</p>
      <p>that is already trying to take advantage of you.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>After four years of high school and four years of college,</p>
      <p>and with $32,000 to $50,000 of unforgivable debt, plus your credit cards, and other tricks.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You are now being insulted,</p>
      <p>on your happy interview day.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You need to consider this,</p>
      <p>and you need to consider what it is like to work in a cubicle for the rest of your life.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Not only are you looking at eight years of school,</p>
      <p>but about 80 years of working in a box, or worse an open space where you can hear all the moth breathers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Self awareness means intercepting mistakes before they happen,</p>
      <p>again only renowned Audio Books by good narrators, written by highly respected and loved authors will help you with this.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>At least a hundred books,</p>
      <p>there is a video of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd_ptbiPoXM" title="Steve Jobs' 2005 Stanford Commencement Address (with intro by President John Hennessy)">Stanford Commencement Address that Steve Jobs gave in 2005</a>, that you may wish to see.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Despite what Mr. Jobs says about the dots,</p>
      <p>you can connect them, it is the job of you increasing your self awareness with books to connect them.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You do not go forward into the future merely trusting your gut, or destiny, life, karma, whatever,</p>
      <p>because the world is full of people that will take advantage of that blind expectation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>So you absolutely need to take care of your mental well being,</p>
      <p>and expansion of your self awareness by listening to dozens and dozens of audio books highly valued by their readers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Even by just watching how Steve Jobs carries him self,</p>
      <p>how he talks about college tuition, he is gently and in very classy way pealing apart that fraud.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is the first and foremost thing he brings up,</p>

      <p>There is this one talk by Richard Dawkins that I really like,</p>
      <p>there is a video titled "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVyeh690TGk">Richard Dawkins - The God Delusion Q&A at Liberty University</a>"</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Liberty University (LU) is a private evangelical Christian university in Lynchburg, Virginia,</p>
      <p>that Q&A was destined for greatness.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>A young lady poses a question "What if you're wrong?",</p>
      <p>and this is my private opinion: I think she was aiming at Pascal's Wager, but Richard Dawkins response was a lot more elaborate than shooting fish in a barrel.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Search the internet for a video entitled "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F_LUFIeUk0">PHILOSOPHY - Religion: Pascal's Wager</a>" for more information on Pascal's Wager,</p>
      <p>which also includes a bespectacled cartoon kitty named Richard Pawkins.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And between you and I the gambit it shutdown with an argument for authenticity,</p>
      <p>if someone believes something purely for personal gain then they can't be invited to a serious discussion.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But the Pascal's Wager interpretation of what this humble young lady is asking about, is just my personal opinion,</p>
      <p>and Richard Dawkins takes it his own way.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Which resulted in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPJQw-x-xho">wonderfully animated Richard Dawkins in a South Park cartoon</a>,</p>
      <p>I love that little smile of accomplishment at the end, but more than that, I love the audience.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The sound of the Audience at Liberty University,</p>
      <p>tells me that we are still headed for the Stars.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But again the reason I bring this up in no uncertain terms is:</p>
      <p>Inheritance of Class, and Culture, and expansion of our awareness of the world, and how we fit in it.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Just observing the way that Richard Dawkins carries him self,</p>
      <p>and hearing the cheer and laughter by all the wonderful people in the audience, helped me expand my personal vision of the world.</p>
