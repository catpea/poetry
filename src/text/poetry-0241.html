    <section>
      <p>If you frown at all the snow,</p>
      <p>there is something you should know.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Put on your mittens, and a hat,</p>
      <p>and buy a big bottle of suntan lotion right where you're at.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>But don't drive back home, just turn south on 275,</p>
      <p>and drive.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>We're going all the way down,</p>
      <p>to take care of your frown.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>You'll drive through Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee,</p>
      <p>right till you get to good old Georgia.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Here you stop, and get some sleep.</p>
      <p>but wake up early, cause we got a pace to keep.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Drive all the way through Florida to US Highway One,</p>
      <p>and be ready to catch some sun.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Get to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/4Xzq7xhwWKGj4aW68">Little Duck Key</a>,</p>
      <p>and park beneath <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/uBv34hWHuhYoLEFs9">a palm tree</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Now, squirt some suntan lotion.</p>
      <p>and enjoy the Ocean.</p>
    </section>
