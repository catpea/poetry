      <p>I took a little nap,</p>
      <p>As I had to finish a website and an app.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I woke up feeling sweet and mighty and very strong.</p>
      <p>even though I really didn't sleep for very long.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Now I have to get ready to go back to real sleep,</p>
      <p>and I hope I don't end up having to count sheep.</p>

    <section>
      <p>I've been learning programming and design all on my own,</p>
      <p>my software is really good now, I have progressed and grown.</p>

    <section>
      <p>There are no shortcuts to becoming really good,</p>
      <p>there is no school that can teach us as they should.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Talking matters in your own hands is the best way,</p>
      <p>the difference is like night and day.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>For decades I've telling people,</p>
      <p>our mind are really, really, really delicate and extremely intricate.</p>

    <section>
      <p>Wherever possible we have to take to the books,</p>
      <p>go on tiny adventures and explore all the crannies and nooks.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>To start learning well, find something pretty,</p>
      <p>real education is like exploring a new city.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>You don't start by memorizing a map,</p>
      <p>you just go from one place to another, until you need a nap.</p>

    <section>
      <p>The teacher has no idea who you are or what you know,</p>
      <p>if you'll listen to them you'll never grow.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Organized education is like a trap,</p>
      <p>learn on your own, and don't forget to take a nap.</p>
