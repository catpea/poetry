      <p>Your Lifeline - the cumulative choices you made that affected your entire life,</p>
      <p>must be precisely aligned to match who you are, so that you may learn.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>This is not an easy thing,</p>
      <p>but there can be no other.</p>

    <section>
      <p>We live in a world under constant erosion from Poverty,</p>
      <p>Authenticity is a difficult path.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Stay safe, love yourself,</p>
      <p>but you must also stand your ground.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>What life is pressing you into,</p>
      <p>and the path that you must be on for your wisdom sake;</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Are likely to be some distance apart,</p>
      <p>this is the tragedy of our modern age.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The complexity of life, will be pushing you away,</p>
      <p>from the line you need to walk to learn and become wise.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The path that life is trying to press you into,</p>
      <p>is almost truly random, it comes out of misery and chance.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The path mere life dictates includes lies and manipulations that you can't see at first,</p>
      <p>people will use your innocence against you, to make their lives simpler.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>When you follow, you fall into cogs of ravenous emergent machinery,</p>
      <p>and this machinery exists, because, followers gather.</p>

    <section>
      <p>My Dear Friends, if you must,</p>
      <p>then know that there is but one you serve.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The Wisest You, The Best You, The Most Brilliant You,</p>
      <p>at the Greatest Age of Your Life, Your Golden Age of Wisdom.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The path that mere life dictates, is a melody out of tune,</p>
      <p>you become a piano key, and life will keep pushing, non-stop.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>But the path you dictate, is very unusual in deed,</p>
      <p>because each step you take, adds to the previous.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And with only a few steps,</p>
      <p>you are stepping higher, you are already building, up.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>That is the same "up", that "Grow Up" uses,</p>
      <p>your own step, followed by you own step, forward and up.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>If you dare to throw caution into the wind,</p>
      <p>it will bring you wisdom - you'll see.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>But other than that, like a cat,</p>
      <p>walk cautiously onward.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>When things start adding up,</p>
      <p>you will surpass your younger self.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And now, where you used to think: "And where am I actually going?",</p>
      <p>you will see a road ahead, by subtle analogy to the road you've already traveled.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Where once you toyed with the question of "Who am I?",</p>
      <p>you will now, see you.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>You'll make little mistakes, and that is OK,</p>
      <p>because you will have your path to fall back on.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And those mistaken tangents, will cradle you,</p>
      <p>they will add, and refine your decision-making.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>When you walk your own path,</p>
      <p>you do not make big mistakes.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The little ones will teach about the bigger ones,</p>
      <p>by subtle analogy.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Your own path,</p>
      <p>is a great teacher.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>So what is it like,</p>
      <p>on that path?</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I am very sorry to say, it is lonely,</p>
      <p>but loneliness is correct.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Not until you find your other half,</p>
      <p>will loneliness let go of you.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>It is there to remind you,</p>
      <p>that you can only make it half-way on your own.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Your own path,</p>
      <p>is above all; clear.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>There are no excuses,</p>
      <p>nothing to sway you.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The air is crisp,</p>
      <p>there is no smog.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Just,</p>
      <p>a clear vision.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Even without any guarantees in life,</p>
      <p>you will become stronger.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>But, yes - no matter how beautiful you become,</p>
      <p>Universe will do nothing to guarantee you, anything.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>This,</p>
      <p>is the Leap of Faith.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And the faith,</p>
      <p>is in Your Greater Self.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Walk your own path, because in the first half of your life,</p>
      <p>your own path is the only thing that can add to you.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Authenticity, is a law of the Universe,</p>
      <p>it follows similar principles.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Walk your own path,</p>
      <p>and expand.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The first steps are always clumsy,</p>
      <p>I went to the museums.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>A coffee shop is a bad idea,</p>
      <p>because everyone is there.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>But a museum is different,</p>
      <p>it filters for kindness, somehow.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I went to the D.I.A</p>
      <p>I was extremely lucky.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>They were showing,</p>
      <p>Auguste Rodin's work.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I understood it immediately, the secret of sculpture,</p>
      <p>is to enlarge that part that holds the soul.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>At the end,</p>
      <p>they had The Waltz (possibly a large replica as it had more detail, this was some 13 years ago), that dancing couple by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camille_Claudel">Camille Claudel</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section><img src="image/poetry-0088-lavalse.jpg" alt="The Waltz"></section>

    <section>
      <p>I started crying,</p>
      <p>her hand, had so much feeling in that gentle arch, there was so much touch.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>That is life,</p>
      <p>that is the path.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The path, where you cry out of beauty,</p>
      <p>and not cry out of being lost.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And you have to create art,</p>
      <p>art is about training yourself for success.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Learning,</p>
      <p>by subtle analogy.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>That's why you never finish,</p>
      <p>there is no time for the art it self.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>There is only time,</p>
      <p>for learning life.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Learning by subtle analogy,</p>
      <p>to the smaller Triumph, and Success.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Stick to a single subject,</p>
      <p>until you fill it completely.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Now you can hang it up at the coffee shop,</p>
      <p>but keep moving forward.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Do not Follow, My Friends,</p>
      <p>there is nothing there to be found.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Nothing you find when you follow,</p>
      <p>will add together to make a whole.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>When it feels like you are surrounded by paths,</p>
      <p>and there is nowhere to go, or you can't go into enough places.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>That is an illusion,</p>
      <p>all those paths are false.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Turn around,</p>
      <p>slow down.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Go back to the last thing that <em>moved</em> you,</p>
      <p>and fearlessly resume at that point.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The world may shake and shudder,</p>
      <p>and there will be "Why?", and "How could you?", and "What is going on?".</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>All those cries,</p>
      <p>are for the person that follows.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Each asking you to a different path,</p>
      <p>and all those paths are mutually incompatible.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Do you see,</p>
      <p>life wants you to merely be.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>But you <em>can</em> be more,</p>
      <p>you don't have to call it Growing Up, Courage, Authenticity or Growing Content of Character.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Call it, and appointment at D.I.A.</p>
      <p>call it, a meeting at the UofM Museum of Natural History.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Begin keeping a Moleskine Journal,</p>
      <p>use a pencil,</p>
      <p>only draw what your heart sees,</p>
      <p>and write as little as possible,</p>
      <p>write to your older self,</p>
      <p>explain to her why?</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Find your center,</p>
      <p>find your balance.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Lean on your Nucleus,</p>
      <p>and push off to take your steps in your own direction.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Calm your hand,</p>
      <p>slow your time.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>There are decades ahead,</p>
      <p>and you have to be seen.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Show yourself,</p>
      <p>create future.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>What others have, may shine,</p>
      <p>but is not always gold they keep.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The younger we are,</p>
      <p>the less wisdom we hold;</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The less wisdom,</p>
      <p>the more questions we should answer.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And questions combined with life,</p>
      <p>make for a busy time in deed.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>So slow down,</p>
      <p>answer your questions - first.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>All life is sacred,</p>
      <p>all Lifelines equally matter.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>But not all will arrive at their Golden Age of Wisdom,</p>
      <p>without regrets.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>So, please,</p>
      <p>ask your older self what her regrets are.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And the higher you grow, the more you know, and which is more,</p>
      <p>the more in harmony with your older-self, you'll be.</p>
