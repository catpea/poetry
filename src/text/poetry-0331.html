      <p>I still have a world to go before I feel comfortable dancing to my dance songs,</p>
      <p>I have no other choice, in a few day every Cutting Shape song will go bad on me.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I danced to my own music before,</p>
      <p>but it was just drums and samples, it wasn't anything fancy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>For the past couple of days I've been searching for "Techno Tutorials",</p>
      <p>whatever it is that I am learning, I always search for THING + the word tutorials.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>That's how I learned my early programming languages,</p>
      <p>one exception was art, it just came to me one day to point an Office Projector on oil canvas.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Three months ago, I searched for "Shuffle Dance Tutorial",</p>
      <p>I think that is my favorite one, I feel amazing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Whenever a tutorial talks about something,</p>
      <p>there is a strong hint of a procedure.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Unlike in a school lecture,</p>
      <p>that has no rhyme or reason, and plenty of noise.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Thus far my favorite video is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k18HxK2lVhY">How to produce Techno #1 - The Basics",</p>
      <p>by Dash Glitch on YouTube</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I don't know the program he is using,</p>
      <p>I am just re-creating the things he talk about with <a href="https://lmms.io/">lmms</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And I learned how to use lmms by just expecting a canvas that will help me arrange song structure,</p>
      <p>and then wanting to see a piano roll, and a beat sequencer.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The need for piano roll and beat sequencer</p>
      <p>came from a tutorial on https://learningmusic.ableton.com/</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>So first I looked at how to make beats and melodies,</p>
      <p>and then practiced with the free lmms program, and now I am breaking down techno.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I already made a tiny test song this afternoon,</p>
      <p>and in deed following the Dash Glitch procedure will create a unique techno song each time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Once I feel comfortable with that,</p>
      <p>I will move on to create dance friendly songs, which is still basically techno.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Without the procedures that Dash Glitch and many other YouTubers present,</p>
      <p>the songs come out too rough.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But by taking the same steps they are, and paying attention to the same details,</p>
      <p>following the general procedure they reveal, it only takes a few minutes to make a new song.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>So open up the internet, type in whatever you are interested in learning, followed by the word "Tutorial",</p>
      <p>and I am certain it won't take you very long to show amazing progress.</p>
