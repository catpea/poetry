      <p>Nobody cared about the old <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrY74-wt6FY">Bulletin Board Systems</a>,</p>
      <p>and not all the people cared about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEkPsfanmo8">Zak McKracken</a>, or later on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8o0a5ntxfc">Wolfenstein 3D</a>.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The old computer dreams are good dreams,</p>
      <p>finely crafted expert systems for one were clearly going to change the world.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>An expert system does basic logic,</p>
      <p>but a finely made one, can actually help us reason about complex issues.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The AI we know today is drenched in chaos,</p>
      <p>it is just statistics done right.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The expert systems, are, tools for us, based on our needs,</p>
      <p>a way of encoding legal systems.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The Mechanical Turk, or as I call it The Ghost In The Machine,</p>
      <p>are a way for all human beings on earth to make money.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqC66POqhY4">MUD</a>, is actually the tool we need to create intelligence,</p>
      <p>it will still rely on statistics, but not blindly.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It would take a life time for one person to craft a world</p>
      <p>where dreams and observations, would combine to create sanity.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Like with all computer programs, garbage in garbage out,</p>
      <p>the virtual world to fuel the real AI, must be finely crafted by a human mind.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Our minds are crafted by a different processes,</p>
      <p>one that involves a lot of accidents.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And cherry on top,</p>
      <p>we are here because accidents come together just right and emerge a civilization,</p>
      <p>that can ask "why are we here?", and we are proof of that.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We have to make use of computers the right way,</p>
      <p>we need legal systems that rely on expert systems.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Simulations will likely reveal,</p>
      <p>that there is certain limit to how many laws are too many and ruin a system.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Simulations will also reveal that we can't fix cities,</p>
      <p>by sentencing people to poverty and fracturing them into a desperate life of crime.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>When I say, "We are all very smart", I mean it,</p>
      <p>but we also need a real education, a fake education can only add to poverty.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>A city that continues fracturing minds with poverty and fake education,</p>
      <p>and then sending them to prisons, and making it so that they can't get a job afterwards...</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Is not a city yet,</p>
      <p>it is still just a hope of one.</p>
    </div>

      <p>Universal Basic Income,</p>
      <p>is a good transition idea.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But then businesses specifically crafted,</p>
      <p>for taking that money will emerge.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We see a model that they can potentially adopt with student debt,</p>
      <p>unforgivable debt, no bankruptcy is big enough to wipe it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We'll just see businesses offering more free money,</p>
      <p>to take a cut of that free income.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And we can't possibly exclude anybody,</p>
      <p>not in prison, not in hospital.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Now that people with debt are going to be receiving free money,</p>
      <p>those checks will be intercepted by debt collection agencies, which as you can imagine are going to spring to life.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And Universal doesn't mean national,</p>
      <p>it means world wide.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>After all,</p>
      <p>we need not create anymore inequality.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We have seen the emergence of special debt,</p>
      <p>the unforgivable student debt.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Now we will need to see the emergence of a new kind of money,</p>
      <p>one that can only be spent by the owner, on what the owner wishes, not what she is forced to spend on...</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But what she chooses to spend it on,</p>
      <p>this is far beyond the thinking of any congress.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But it is trivial for a computer system to process another kind of currency,</p>
      <p>I say we give it a name right now, before someone beat us to it, let us call it Love, with the symbol of a Red Heart.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And might as well create a new country for it,</p>
      <p>the country should be called Love as well, and it should be a tiny little thing, maybe a square meter at first.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It will have a bank on paper,</p>
      <p>and that bank will be very wealthy, for Humanity will have to agree to give it the possession of one of more of the larger planets in the Suns orbit.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>This is to satisfy the bankers,</p>
      <p>I say, lets give Love the Planet Venus, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4mc-alL92U">The Oort Cloud</a>,</p>
      <p>that should be a pretty penny, and might as well give Venus, Jupiter, as gassy as he is I think they are a good match.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Come to think of it,</p>
      <p>why don't we avoid the whole argument of where the Love Nation should be place on earth, and simply establish it, in the orbit of Venus.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Now we have a currency that cannot be used to pay of debt,</p>
      <p>but can be used to buy a home, and food, and medicine.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You may laugh,</p>
      <p>but Humanity has to grow.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>What we have right now,</p>
      <p>is just a stepping stone.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is meant to be used once,</p>
      <p>on our way to the next step.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>When we are children,</p>
      <p>we are not defined by borders.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We don't care about dumb ideas,</p>
      <p>like color of skin, name of some imaginary creature, concentration camps, or war.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We should not allow ourselves to get dumber as we grow older,</p>
      <p>and instead take what wisdom we have as children, and amplify it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It seems sometimes, that the world would be a much nicer place,</p>
      <p>if it was ran by the kids in the world's kindergarten's with some good advice from their loving mums and teachers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Weapons of war, would be forbidden,</p>
      <p>borders would be erased every one of them.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And let me tell you something,</p>
      <p>which currency would do think they would pick as the main one, you bet they would!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But rather than bothering clearly WISE-er people who are otherwise still growing up,</p>
      <p>lets just use computers instead.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Every bank terminal would now require a new filed, Planet Name,</p>
      <p>The Bank Of Love, Milky Way Road 1, Planet Venus.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I think overtime, as it gre in power,</p>
      <p>it would create some principles that must not be violated by Earth's Nations that now rely on it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And it would get tough,</p>
      <p>saying no to Weapons of War is easy, but this bank would also say no to Prisons, cages, or as I call it Slavery under the protection of the 13th amendment.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Slowly,</p>
      <p>these clear ideas, would realign Humanity with reality.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I know many will disagree wit these ideas,</p>
      <p>but these ideas are not for them, their disagreement means that they are not allowed to use that Lovely Credit Card themselves, they can disagree all they want.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>They will just sit in their expensive retirement homes,</p>
      <p>yelling at clouds, and it is their own wish, no backsies.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Children deserve a real education,</p>
      <p>and a kind of money for home, food medicine, hospital, and many other necessities that make Earth look better, in Venus' eyes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Let us not dismiss this day dream,</p>
      <p>instead let us make it real.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>When we are brought up correctly,</p>
      <p>without abusive indoctrination, we are just one family.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Whoever out there is shooting across some border,</p>
      <p>they are only doing so because how they were brought up.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>There is only one way to be brought up on earth,</p>
      <p>with Knowledge, with Wisdom, and encouragement towards becoming Great Beings,</p>
      <p>and honoring every other human being on earth with a lasting contribution, even if it is a silly day dream that is hard to forget.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Remember, the people who ridicule stories like this,</p>
      <p>are only doing that, because they were brought up into a in invisible prison, a prison whose walls they cannot see.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>They will do horrible things to stay in their prisons,</p>
      <p>we have to wait them out, and help the children understand that all the horrible things they see are horrible.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We can explain that this is how humanity transitions,</p>
      <p>from the old to the new, there are these wretched middle steps as we wait for dictatorships to crumble.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>When I asked my grand ma to explain what they were doing on TV,</p>
      <p>she said it was war.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And when I asked why, she said,</p>
      <p>"Because, that is what men do."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Let us change that answer from now on,</p>
      <p>and instead let it become:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>"We are in a state of transition and in search for great and powerful dreams, as we wait for evil men to age and pass away.</p>
      <p>And children like you to be brought up in Knowledge, Wisdom, and in Greatness.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>See, we cannot fight the bullies back,</p>
      <p>because then we would become bullies too, and that cycle must be broken.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>So we bring up out children towards Greatness,</p>
      <p>while we wait for the broken men to become faded and pass.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>When you grow up,</p>
      <p>time will come for you to become a leader.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But unlike the old,</p>
      <p>the new will aim towards Greatness.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Unlike the old,</p>
      <p>the new will take the greatest possible steps, not the smallest.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And when it all becomes too complicated,</p>
      <p>always remember, computers are the tools of the future, and they will make everything easier for you."</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I will close my story here,</p>
      <p>we invented new currency, we built a beautiful nation on Venus, and we changed the world.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And if it all seems too much,</p>
      <p>you should remember Dear Reader, that we are already testing interplanetary Ships, the next step may not be that far off, as far as generations go.</p>
