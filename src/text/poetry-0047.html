      <p>Think of a trickster, a real bad fool.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>What a great robbery it would be.</p>
      <p>If your parents sent you to college.</p>
      <p>And teachers sold disconnected snippets.</p>
      <p>And called it knowledge.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>And wouldn't it be convenient,</p>
      <p>if you could chose you next batch.</p>
      <p>Wouldn't the trickster rejoice,</p>
      <p>had you called, that, a choice.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>And then at the end of the day.</p>
      <p>When hard earned money was taken.</p>
      <p>You wouldn't even be shaking,</p>
      <p>even though it was worse than a break-in.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Think of a trickster, a real bad fool,</p>
      <p>that took away your very own school.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>The moral of this story,</p>
      <p>is that you should think through,</p>
      <p>when someone offers to teach you.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Education, requires that you learn on your own,</p>
      <p>that something that teaching can only postpone.</p>
