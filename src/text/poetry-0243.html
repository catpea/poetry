      <p>Invent everything,</p>
      <p>we are all extremely smart.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>We can learn anything,</p>
      <p>so as long as we don't skip any steps along the way.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And so as long,</p>
      <p>as all steps are interesting and fun to us.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Never force yourself to learn something you don't enjoy,</p>
      <p>just keep reading books, and keep looking for something to strike your fancy.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>From Dreaming, and Inventing,</p>
      <p>to Art, Programming and taking to the skies.</p>

      <p>An invention can be as simple,</p>
      <p>as an LED Throwie or LED Glowie.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Just a Light Emitting Diode, a battery and magnet,</p>
      <p>to keep it all together; and as a bonus make it stick to metal surfaces.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>That is a three component invention,</p>
      <p>LED, magnet, battery.</p>

      <section>
        <p>Quips, that the baseline for determining if a member of a species is intelligent,</p>
        <p>is whether or not it can hold a soldering iron, and make a radio.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>Allow me to get you soldering a radio,</p>
        <p>as quickly as possible.</p>

        <p>Get a Raspberry PI Zero W (the W stands for Wireless or "with WI-FI"),</p>
        <p>a soldering kit, a solder wick, some GPIO headers,</p>
        <p>and a <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Waveshare+RGB+LED+HAT+True+Color+Onboard+4+%C3%97+8+RGB+LED&t=ffab&ia=web">4 x 8 RGB LED HAT</a> that fits a Raspberry PI Zero neatly.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>Look everything up on YouTube,</p>
        <p>how to solder, how to solder headers, how to use a solder wick.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>This is serious business,</p>
        <p>in last few years embedded Linux became extremely inexpensive.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- command not found: 10 -->

      <section>
        <p>Though <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=Vilros+Raspberry+Pi+Zero+W+Basic+Starter+Kit&ia=web">get a $30 kit</a></p>
        <p>that includes a case, power adapter, heat sinks, and a header.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>At first you connect it to a keyboard and a monitor,</p>
        <p>and set it up on the network.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>But later as you figure everything out,</p>
        <p>you unplug everything leaving just the power.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>To get inside it,</p>
        <p>you use a remote terminal.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>Once you login,</p>
        <p>you get a command prompt.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>It listens to words, to commands,</p>
        <p>very similar to adventure games.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>Indeed, directories on your hard-drive,</p>
        <p>are very much like rooms in a game.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>To get inside Documents,</p>
        <p>type in "cd Documents"</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>The command "cd" is short for,</p>
        <p>Change Directory, a Directory is the same as a folder on windows.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>When you say "cd Documents",</p>
        <p>you are giving the cd command an argument, or an option, or a setting, or a preference.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>The cd command is a perfect example of how command line interfaces should work,</p>
        <p>just a couple of words and nothing more.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>But sometimes, that is not enough,</p>
        <p>like for example when you want to ask "cd" for help.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>We can't say "cd help" becasue then the cd command would search for a directory named help,</p>
        <p>we have to make the second word special, to do that you use hyphens.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>You can type in "cd --help",</p>
        <p>it will notice the hyphens, and print out some helpful information.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>To see what is in a directory, type in "ls",</p>
        <p>which is short for list, or list files.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>"ls" also accepts special inputs,</p>
        <p>you can ask it for help like above.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>But also ask it to list files in a long format,</p>
        <p>by saying "ls -l" here we use a singe hyphen, because "-l" is commonly used,</p>
        <p>the -l is short for "--long-listing", but nobody bothers spelling that out.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>To list files with readable file sizes,</p>
        <p>you have to add -h, here -h has long form, and some people may use spell it out as "--human-readable"</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>Usually when writing complex commands that other people will use,</p>
        <p>the long form is preferred, bu when you are just typing on the command line and want to do something quickly,</p>
        <p>you just use the short versions.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>The command line interface is trying to be your friend,</p>
        <p>it wants to function with just one or two words, but it also some with extras like the --human-readable flag.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>There are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=raspberry+pi+terminal+command+line">many tutorials</a> on how to use the command line,</p>
        <p>and many books, my favorite are the pocket books, take a look at <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=O%27Reilly+Bash+Pocket+Reference&t=ffab&ia=web">O'Reilly Bash Pocket Reference</a></p>
      </section>

      <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/audio/">Here are instructions</a> on how to play audio through HDMI,
      <p>your monitor should have an audio out somewhere.</p>

      <p>Now see if you can get that GPIO header soldered on,</p>
      <p>and try to blink some of the RGB LED HAT lights <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/RGB_LED_HAT">based on this tutorial</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Alternatively you can just blink a simple LED based on <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Control-LED-Using-Raspberry-Pi-GPIO/">this instructable</a>,</p>
      <p>note that a standard Raspberry PI 4 8GB comes with the header soldered on to make things easier.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And there is also a Raspberry PI WH,</p>
      <p>meaning Wireless with Headers pre-soldered.</p>
    </section>

    <section>

    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And now, get a $10 camera,</p>
      <p>and use <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/camera/raspicam/raspistill.md">raspistill</a> to take a photo,</p>
      <p>and play around with <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/raspbian/applications/camera.md">all the other options</a>.</p>

    <section>
      <p>Now you have an inexpensive platform for your inventions,</p>
      <p>a programmable machine, that you access over the radio of your wireless network.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>You can make it blink, or take time-lapse photographs of the next snow storm,</p>
      <p>you can get an <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Raspberry+Pi+7-Inch+LCD&t=ffab&ia=web">LCD screen</a> and <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=RS+Raspberry+Pi+7-Inch+LCD+Touch+Screen+Case%2C+Black+&ia=web">turn it into a tablet</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Raspberry PI is not the only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-board_computer">Single-board computer</a>,</p>
      <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=PINE+Single+Board+Computer+&t=ffab&ia=web">PINE</a> looks really nice as well.

      <section>
        <p>If you are looking for a more complicated project,</p>
        <p>perhaps try building a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Raspberry+PI+Drone">Raspberry PI Drone</a>,</p>
        <p>bonus if you can get it to cross the Atlantic.</p>

        <p>We have no limits,</p>
        <p>but we are also very unique.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>Our inventions need not rely on commuters,</p>
        <p>some of the greatest inventions the Human Kind has seen, were just ideas.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>Don't let anybody stop you from inventing,</p>
        <p>and don't stop dreaming.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>Finally, the most impractical and outrageous inventions,</p>
        <p>make for the most magnificent Videos, White Papers, CVs, and Resumes.</p>
