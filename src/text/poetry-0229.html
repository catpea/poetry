    <section>
      <p>Humanity is like a Garden,</p>
      <p>and Humans are flowers that grow with Knowledge.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>No one flower can make the other grow,</p>
      <p>but we can share and pass on good ideas amongst each other.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>All those good ideas combined,</p>
      <p>form our body of Knowledge.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Only with real knowledge,</p>
      <p>can we bloom in Wisdom.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>A Blooming Garden,</p>
      <p>is a Higher Power.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>To help Humanity grow,</p>
      <p>free and mandatory education was invented.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Our level of knowledge rose,</p>
      <p>and it rose high enough for us to want more.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The original schools in their zeal to process everyone,</p>
      <p>are attempting to confine the garden withing its small walls.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The schools are a simple and dumb machine,</p>
      <p>aim to produce the same bunch of flowers.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>New, smart technology, has emerged,</p>
      <p>and we are now able to Listen to Books and Pick our own Lectures.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And we must do so,</p>
      <p>and as quickly as possible.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Let us then choose a small and interesting adventure,</p>
      <p>and in the perfect sequence, and at just the right pace.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Begin our study of what we like,</p>
      <p>and not what somebody else <i>wants</i> us to like.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The flowers need Real Knowledge to Bloom,</p>
      <p>and real knowledge can only be gained and sustained by what we enjoy.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Each flower leans towards a unique constellation of starts,</p>
      <p>there is nothing that can be standardized about Real Education.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Standardized Education can only destroy spirit and creativity,</p>
      <p>exhaust us, spark by irreplaceable spark, and without ever lighting the flame.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>As soon as you feel that school is holding you back,</p>
      <p>read your own books, watch your own documentaries and lectures.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Real education, is your own education,</p>
      <p>one that you will care for and nurture with passion and joy throughout your entire existence.</p>
    </section>

      <p>Personal Note,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>It may feel silly at first,</p>
      <p>when you finally take your first baby steps towards something you like.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>But that is just a beginning,</p>
      <p>they are always very little.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The beautiful thing about it,</p>
      <p>is that your first step, will be quickly followed by your second one.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>For example,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>You may take to watercolors,</p>
      <p>and it will all come out a crooked doodle.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>But that does not mean that it is over,</p>
      <p>or that you are not a genius.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>It means you need to buy,</p>
      <p>a $100 Video Projector.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Take a selfie,</p>
      <p>project it on your watercolor paper.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Use a pencil to mark where colors go,</p>
      <p>and now you can paint anew.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Oh, and by the way, to lower color saturation,</p>
      <p>mix it with the color opposite, on the color wheel.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Now armed with those two baby steps,</p>
      <p>ask your heart, where to go next?</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Posters, Murals, Pixel Art,</p>
      <p>and if you are unsure, then take a break...</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>and design and write a small art book about finding a good projector,</p>
      <p>and selecting just the right paints, so that you may deeply reflect n what moves you.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Everything comes with a sweet and beautiful little road like this,</p>
      <p>we are all human, and what we achieve, we achieve with our hearts.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>One of the reasons why many of the wonders that we admire today, exist,</p>
      <p>is because someone found a pleasant path to get there a baby step at a time.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Now it might have taken them ten years of baby steps to get there,</p>
      <p>but since it was what they loved, they didn't even think of it as a challenge.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>When we follow the path that enriches us,</p>
      <p>high achievement becomes indistinguishable from growing up.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Later on in life,</p>
      <p>as we face new challenges.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>It will be our sweet little pursuits and lessons,</p>
      <p>that will offer us the answers we need.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And do so by subtle and beautiful analogy,</p>
      <p>to the little problems that we solved in our happy pursuits of yesteryear.</p>
