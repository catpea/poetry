      <p>May all your days add,</p>
      <p>may you never feel sad.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Because it is hard to say,</p>
      <p>what things may.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>We certainly know not,</p>
      <p>the world; dot for dot.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>What we do know,</p>
      <p>is not to resign or live low.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Because life is one,</p>
      <p>so live as bright as the sun.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And as wise,</p>
      <p>as the true sunrise.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And as smart,</p>
      <p>as the unbroken heart.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Growing is your right,</p>
      <p>your most magnificent might.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Do not waste a single day,</p>
      <p>and always walk your own way.</p>
