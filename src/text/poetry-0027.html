      <p>Captain's Log, Eternal, Quarantine, Day Twenty Two.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Eeeeek! It's raining, I am trying not to be complaining.</p>
      <p>But the sky is no longer blue, what am I to do?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Each time I sneeze, the power goes out,</p>
      <p>not to say my sneezes are not petite, or that I am ill!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>No, I am perfectly fine, I don't need to blow my nose.</p>
      <p>It is the transformer outside that blows!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Frantically, atomically I hit CTRL+S, CTRL+S, save, save. Saves,</p>
      <p>as the thunderous thunder thunders its electromagnetic waves.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>How am I going to finish, how can I upload,</p>
      <p>when any moment something will explode,</p>
      <p>and there will be nothing where current once flowed.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>While the rain has slowed, my fingers still tapping,</p>
      <p>Save, save, save! rise! against the Gigawatt Wave.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Seriously, please remember to save your files,</p>
      <p>this can only result in more smiles.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Also, please remember to backup your files.</p>
      <p>As that's even better, by miles.</p>
