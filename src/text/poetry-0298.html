      <p>Might is meant for battle only,</p>
      <p>when battles end, we must return to balance.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Life is meant to revolve around cheerfulness,</p>
      <p>or sweet mischief if you are one of those.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>It is fueled by knowledge,</p>
      <p>driven by wisdom, all towards greatness.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>It matters that we are good to ourselves,</p>
      <p>that we care about our body and mind.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Some battles such as World Peace,</p>
      <p>can't yet be fought, and we must not try.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>If something is too big,</p>
      <p>then it will take our cheerfulness and life away.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>There is much in the world that needs repair,</p>
      <p>but first the world must become wiser.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Before a battle for World Peace is fought,</p>
      <p>we must repair schools.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And before we take to repairing schools,</p>
      <p>we must first speak out about what is wrong with them.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The wiser our approach to such great endeavors,</p>
      <p>the more you will see that it calls for clear thinking.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And clear thinking cannot come,</p>
      <p>out of an unbalanced mind.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>It requires peace, and cheerfulness, the sun and the moon,</p>
      <p>ocean sunshine, snowy adventures, and fragrant woods.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>We must be kind to ourselves,</p>
      <p>as in haste of might, all our life may pass us by.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And so I offer a small purrsciption,</p>
      <p>to ensure that you are forever well.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Above all,</p>
      <p>slow down.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Ensure that have time to listen to an audio book each week,</p>
      <p>the book need not be long but it must be fascinating.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Prepare a tent and a backpack for this summer,</p>
      <p>even if it is just for camping in your backyard.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Get a Mini Projector to trace photos on canvas,</p>
      <p>and get some good watercolors, oils or pencils to begin study art.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And to keep heath, search the internet for Dance Tutorials,</p>
      <p>and let the music move your body.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>You can be sure that you live in balance within your self,</p>
      <p>when you have time for self improvement and keeping healthy.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>If this is something that you can't do,</p>
      <p>then you must learn to love yourself more, and try harder.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Your health and the way you treat yourself in life,</p>
      <p>must be the first and foremost concern.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Because, if you can't or don't care about yourself,</p>
      <p>then many others will be too scared to care for you.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Haste and Might are handy,</p>
      <p>but just for a little while.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Balance, Creativity, Peace, and Health,</p>
      <p>is how life is meant to be lived.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Do not be scared to switch majors, or carers, or continents,</p>
      <p>be good to yourself, strive to be cheerful.</p>
