      <p>Evolution, or perhaps it is little more than chance,</p>
      <p>made it so that we have a tendency to follow.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFZTbD6Fno4">Richard Dawkins</a> demonstrates that very well in his</p>

      <p>We will believe in things that we are born to,</p>
      <p>what surrounds us becomes our reality.</p>

      <p>The individuals born with a tendency to question elders,</p>

      <p>Pandemics are an eye opening moment,</p>
      <p>it is the beings that questioned religions,</p>

      <p>Any religion that attacks the vaccines,</p>

      <p>There is no point arguing against reality,</p>
      <p>it makes us better, stronger, reliable, dignified.</p>

      <p>Philip Zimbardo, and Daniel Amen,</p>
      <p>bring up some extremely powerful research.</p>

      <p>Many of us have heard of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XN2X72jrFk">The Stanford Prison Experiment</a>,</p>
      <p>where ordinary people all of a sudden become terrible when given the role of guard.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But Dear Philip Zimbardo,</p>
      <p>didn't stop at the prison, I believe he immediately understood what was going on.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>He might have even created The Stanford Prison Experiment,</p>
      <p>to test a theory.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The theory of how our surroundings,</p>
      <p>influence our mental health.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Personally, by surroundings I mean the whole thing,</p>
      <p>from the cubicle walls, to weasel CEOs, to do nothing approach in politics, all the way out to active concentration camps and legal slavery.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>See,</p>
      <p>Mr. Zimbardo is correct.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Not only must we learn to become Knowledge,</p>
      <p>but we have to reject all the evil, injustice, and mediocrity that has become the norm.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>If we don't reject all the ongoing mistakes,</p>
      <p>we will become ill, it will get to us.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>So you are not just on a quest to become Knowledgabe and Wise,</p>
      <p>but also on a quest to reject all the wrong things that have become the norm.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Here is Mr. Zimbardo explaining what I mean in the first 59 seconds of his talk entitled:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRR3Mo4noU">TEDxMidwest - Phil Zimbardo - Heroes</a></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We have to alter the entire Human Environment,</p>
      <p>of course reality is on our side.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>To take prisons as example, Daniel Amen explains a new insight into the criminal mind,</p>
      <p>see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esPRsT-lmw8">The most important lesson from 83,000 brain scans by Daniel Amen</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>To repeat that Dostoyevsky quote:</p>
      <p>"A society should be judged not by how it treats its outstanding citizens, but by how it treats its criminals."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>This is correct, prisons were always unethical, but Daniel Amen explains why,</p>
      <p>many of those people are very ill, and the environment of the prison and the hopelessness that they from thinking about us being our here, is making them even more ill.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>House arrest is fine, crazy long community service is not too bad so as long as it involves minimum wage,</p>
      <p>but our best approach is preventing people from entering a life of crime, that is exactly what Mr. Zimbardo is going.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>He is helping children resist the influence that their environment has on them,</p>
      <p>his legacy is not going to be the Prison Experiment, but the Heroic Imagination Project.</p>

      <p>As we become more and more knowledgeable and wise, and strong,</p>
      <p>we have to learn to stand against what is wrong with the world.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is not just about us being Knowledgeable and Wise,</p>
      <p>but also helping others to see the countless things that made us that way.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>This is called Greatness, becoming strong on the inside,</p>
      <p>and then making Wise, Meaningful, Inspirational and Lasting constructions to our word, and encouraging others to do the same.</p>
