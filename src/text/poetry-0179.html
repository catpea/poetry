    <p>It rained today, but was also my jogging day,</p>
    <p>so went about it in a warrior's way.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>I looked out the window and it was entirely too dark,</p>
    <p>I said, "I hope I wont have to hide under a tree in some park."</p>

  <section>
    <p>As I made it to Ford Road it didn't seem that bad,</p>
    <p>and then I felt the first three drops hit my head.</p>

  <section>
    <p>I decided to keep going as a proper health nut should,</p>
    <p>and a quarter way through, I got soaked pretty good.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>Just when I thought the clouds parted,</p>
    <p>there was a grumble and the rain really started.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>It rained heavy, but it didn't last very long,</p>
    <p>I ran cheerfully feeling Mighty and Strong.</p>

    <p>My biggest problem were the geese,</p>
    <p>where I come from it is a fierce creature that knows no peace.</p>

  <section>
    <p>When I was a child they chased me and would often hiss,</p>
    <p>but the ones by the Mall seem to be loving and full of bliss.</p>

  <section>
    <p>I was a beautiful day beautiful day, without a doubt,</p>
    <p>and, as the afternoon unfolded the sun came out.</p>
