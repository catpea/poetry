      <p>Same things may have many different names,</p>
      <p>and different things can be called by the same name.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Add liars, manipulators, pretenders,</p>
      <p>the vengeful, greedy, and blind.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Add language barriers, national borders,</p>
      <p>fake education, indoctrination, censorship,</p>
      <p>misinformation, nationalism.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Add manipulation, disagreement, conflict, madness,</p>
      <p>hate, apathy, desperation and stress.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Add weapons manufacturing,</p>
      <p>and mutually assured destruction.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And there is no more common language left,</p>
      <p>for exchange of important ideas.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Maybe there never was,</p>
      <p>a common language.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Certainly, we must ensure,</p>
      <p>that we do share a language.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Let us set the context, then,</p>
      <p>we are an important chain-link,</p>
      <p>in an endless progression of Human Generations.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>You, are One of One Hundred Billion Human Beings,</p>
      <p>to have ever lived.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Billions more will follow,</p>
      <p>across millions of years ahead.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>We are going to be here for so long,</p>
      <p>that Evolution and Science will alter our very appearance.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Our actions will be Judged in the Courtroom of Time,</p>
      <p>presided over by all the future generation.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Some, far in the future, may consider out modern times,</p>
      <p>hardly distinguishable from Dark Ages.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>We don't get old,</p>
      <p>we grow wiser.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Many Great Beings repeat that,</p>
      <p>"Old age is a privileged denied to many".</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And eventually,</p>
      <p>we will take to the stars.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>We are to live Happy, Authentic,</p>
      <p>Fulfilling and Meaningful Lives.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>There is no time for Lies or Babble,</p>
      <p>but there is plenty of time for pursuits of excellence.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And time never stands still,</p>
      <p>so much so that there is no such thing as business as usual.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The usual does not last long enough,</p>
      <p>to become the norm.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>We are to lead the way,</p>
      <p>to rise to the challenges ahead.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And to move with such Magnificent Grace,</p>
      <p>as to transcend the limits we didn't even notice we had.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Education and Culture,</p>
      <p>is the only things that sets us apart,</p>
      <p>from the beings of the Dark Ages.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>We progressed out of those times,</p>
      <p>by ever pushing forward and above.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>By becoming more abstract thinkers,</p>
      <p>and by using abstract thinking,</p>
      <p>to solve problems,</p>
      <p>by subtle analogy to other solutions.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The internet, is the first great step,</p>
      <p>towards a Better World.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>A world connected with devices,</p>
      <p>capable of helping us communicate,</p>
      <p>without a single bit of misunderstanding or distrust.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>This clear communication interface of the future,</p>
      <p>is but a simple engineering problem.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Perhaps, it is a symbolic user interface language,</p>
      <p>perhaps a Virtual World,</p>
      <p>perhaps a simulated City Government that grows to become the Planetary Government.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>But certainly, it is near,</p>
      <p>and it will not be stopped,</p>
      <p>and it will be a source of truth,</p>
      <p>and it will transcend borders,</p>
      <p>and it will beam from the sky.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And there will be no room for lies,</p>
      <p>no room for manipulations,</p>
      <p>nothing to gain by weapons manufacturing,</p>
      <p>nothing to gain by hoping to carve humanity with borders,</p>
      <p>or deny basic rights.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>It will slowly sneak up on those,</p>
      <p>who would wish to stop it.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>It will sneak up on them by means,</p>
      <p>of their very own ignorance and arrogance.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>In the world of the future,</p>
      <p>we exist as One Humanity.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>There is no poverty,</p>
      <p>there is no hunger.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And our greatest aim,</p>
      <p>is Great Health, Impossible Wisdom,</p>
      <p>and simple Cheerfulness and Happiness and Joy.</p>

      <p>Captains Log, Supplemental, September 13, 2820</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>There is a huge unmentionable Universal Debt,</p>
      <p>that originally, by mistake, landed on a single credit card,</p>
      <p>of an unsuspecting young lady in Belgium</p>
      <p>- nobody knows why, including myself!</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>She was just born the year it happened,</p>
      <p>so she didn't even need a card.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Someone just noticed that all debt was being charged to her account,</p>
      <p>never said anything, and somehow, it stayed that way, for many hundreds of years afterwards.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Once she became legally obliged to do something about her debt circa 2040,</p>
      <p>it was just cheaper to ignore the account, than to print the bill,</p>
      <p>not to mention the bills needed to pay it off.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Notably some decades later,</p>
      <p>arguably the most valuable human being on Earth,</p>
      <p>would sweetly joke that she was the Most Worthless One.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>She's been paying for everyone's food,</p>
      <p>including all the pizzas economists eat,</p>
      <p>so no one dared to say a thing for ages.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Hundreds of years later,</p>
      <p>the new generations just assumed,</p>
      <p>money was invented to be helpful (certainly not hurtful),</p>
      <p>and that Little Chloé was the original inventor.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>We are one family, after all,</p>
      <p>there is no need to go hungry - never was.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>It is of some note, that the most expensive thing she paid for,</p>
      <p>was the first Star Ship, the Asteroid class Ark that begun colonizing the Milky Way.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>That age was marked by our crossing from Homo Sapiens, to Homo Deus,</p>
      <p>and the Star Ship was named, after none other than our little Chloé.</p>
