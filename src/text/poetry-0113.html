      <p>You know me, I am not one to complain,</p>
      <p>but; every once in a while a little bird flies into my jogging lane.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>She lands, and turns her head to look at me,</p>
      <p>the moment she sees that I see...</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>...she starts hopping, moving <strong>much</strong> faster than me,</p>
      <p>at first I thought she was trying to raise me as her baby.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>But now I think she's only doing this, to mock me,</p>
      <p>she's just sick of seeing me struggle from her tree.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>For one, when she's done racing me,</p>
      <p>she stops and just stares angrily.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Then she always takes off for my face,</p>
      <p>it is really hard to duck when you are trying to focus on your pace.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I have a theory as to why she flies at me this way,</p>
      <p>though I am afraid to say,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Umm...</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Some of the flies that catch me when I leave my yard,</p>
      <p>you know, those little ones that are always trying to lick so hard.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Even after several miles... they kind of keep my pace,</p>
      <p>kind of actually run circles around my face.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>While, I bring most of the flies back,</p>
      <p>the bird probably flies at me like this, to grab a snack.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Well,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I am now trying really hard to improve my pace,</p>
      <p>to get all those creatures out of my face.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I run fast just as soon as I get out of my home.</p>
      <p>maybe if I can outrun the flies the bird will leave me alone.</p>
