      <p>I was tossing and turning late at night,</p>
      <p>only to be awoken by thunder and a flash of light.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The room shook and I felt it in my chest,</p>
      <p>but I was wearing earplugs so I didn't hear the rest.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I used to be scared of thunder quite a bit,</p>
      <p>then I was told if you can hear it - you didn't get hit.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I am not sure what kind of advice that is,</p>
      <p>but it made thunderstorms a breeze.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I figured it was going to be too wet and muddy,</p>
      <p>to ride my iron horse buddy.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>So I resumed working on my web page,</p>
      <p>and now I am in the finishing stage.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>When all else fails there is always web design,</p>
      <p>at the end of the day everything will turn out fine.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I had to rest a bit as I switched from 8PM to 5AM for my endurance running,</p>
      <p>but now I feel can resume, and become even more stunning.</p>
