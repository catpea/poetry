    <section>
    <p>I had a strange dream, Dear Reader, and at first I thought it was too odd to share,</p>
    <p>but now I am thinking, maybe someone you will care.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <p>I dreamt that schools were totally, completely fake,</p>
    <p>and that the future of the whole world was at stake.</p>
    </section>

    <section><hr></section>

    <section>
    <p>They became fake because they never could teach,</p>
    <p>no teacher has ever had that kind of reach.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <p>Eventually it just became all make believe,</p>
    <p>and school became a real thief.</p>
    </section>

    <section><hr></section>

    <section>
    <p>It stole Knowledge from you,</p>
    <p>it did it to get teachers paid through.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <p>Most assumed, you wouldn't notice as it kept all blind,</p>
    <p>but that early Knowledge was important for the shaping the mind.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <p>There was no one in charge, so no whistle was blown,</p>
    <p>it was fake it until you make it, each on their own.</p>
    </section>

    <section><hr></section>

    <section>
    <p>They wrote tests to keep scores within range,</p>
    <p>to stay below all radars, and to resist any improvement or change.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <p>Expensive text books, purely artificial grades,</p>
    <p>cheap college and expensive university to encourage transfers and trades.</p>
    </section>

    <section><hr></section>

    <section>
    <p>The students who did well,</p>
    <p>they had to keep quiet to pass, and anyway, there was no one to tell.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <p>They had to work thrice as hard working with tutors and in groups,</p>
    <p>jumping stupid hoops, making pointless and crazy loops.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <p>And they knew that their success made schools look real and true,</p>
    <p>but they had no choice, they had to, graduate and move on through.</p>
    </section>

    <section><hr></section>

    <section>
    <p>Then you got up and said "I am through!,</p>
    <p>"how do we fix this - what do we do?"</p>
    </section>

    <section><hr></section>

    <section>
    <p>That's when I woke up, and thought - "Maybe I should answer this.",</p>
    <p>and the first thought that came to my mind was "Knowledge is Bliss"</p>
    </section>

    <section><hr></section>

    <section>
    <p>So I said out loud: "Real Education must be your own creation!",</p>
    <p>after all, is not too hard to find moving inspiration so that you can build your own education.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <p>And why do we need a small High School lecture,</p>
    <p>perhaps it is time to change that architecture.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <p>We should listen to a Famous Audio Books or the University Edition,</p>
    <p>perhaps that should become the standard position.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <p>Standardized testing should not lead the way,</p>
    <p>it is just a test to see if we learning OK.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <p>It seem to me that time has come for change,</p>
    <p>perhaps this is why schools feel so strange.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <p>So, I challenge you, my Dear Reader,</p>
    <p>lead the change you hope to see, become the leader!</p>
