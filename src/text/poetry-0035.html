      <p>Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Thirty,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I've been fixing bugs all day, and I feel dirty.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Now, that I fixed them all,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I must admit, I had a ball.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>But, computers are slow,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>My CPU is slower than a BBQ.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I tried to build a rhyming dictionary,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>but it came out as an 8 megabyte webpage,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>and nearly erased the internet.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>In computers, everything is really bad,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>but this never makes me sad, I am glad.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And now,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I took a shower,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>and smell great,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>my only wish,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>is that I already ate.</p>
    </section>
