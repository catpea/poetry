      <p>The growing up of a civilization is not just about its girth,</p>
      <p>it is also about its collective wisdom, future, and mirth.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>For the people to be happy, and grow in wisdom and joy,</p>
      <p>there are several techniques that they must employ.</p>

      <p>Much, though not most of meaning of life is found in the simple process,</p>
      <p>of Self Education, Knowledge, Wisdom, and search for Greatness.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And the reason why Greatness is the direction to reach,</p>
      <p>is our self awareness, consciousness, and ability to teach.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Once a civilization can ponder it self,</p>
      <p>once it is able to fill a bookshelf...</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It then _should_ aim as high as it can,</p>
      <p>that should be its promise and master plan.</p>
    </div>

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But, the first and foremost is World Peace,</p>
      <p>so all the anger, conflicts and wars, must cease.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Different cultures must learn to share a common vision,</p>
      <p>we have to converse on wisdom and without anymore collision.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>To become wise we must take to self education, knowledge and books,</p>
      <p>we have to go all the way around all the liars and crooks.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We can no longer afford to be divided,</p>
      <p>it matters not who with whom sided,ask the future generation what they decided.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We must help the younger generations know,</p>
      <p>that their aim is to take to wisdom and grow.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>One important thing that we must ensure,</p>
      <p>is that they live without stress so that they can easily mature.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Stress is born from, punishment, poverty, fatigue and lies,</p>
      <p>and actually prevents children from becoming wise.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We have to help them to a rational vision of all the future ahead,</p>
      <p>help them build companies so that they don't graduate in the red.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Growing up must be relaxed, safe, and cheerful,</p>
      <p>and our generations grew up all too fearful.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We have to put an end to throwing our mistakes at their feet,</p>
      <p>their childhood must _not_ be bittersweet.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We have to show them that the world can become beautiful for all,</p>
      <p>and, we have to remove mistakes that drag the world down, and take down every wall.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We have to lead them to a more peaceful world,</p>
      <p>and remind them to remove their own world mistakes as they grow old.</p>
    </div>

      <p>Inspiring to Grantees, and the removal of our collective mistakes,</p>
      <p>is all that it takes.</p>
