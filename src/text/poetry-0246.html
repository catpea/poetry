      <p>Very gently we must step out of comfort zone,</p>
      <p>and find something our elder selves may wish to have known.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>We learn best out of curiosity and in need,</p>
      <p>and to so start we need a direction and a seed.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>A direction is set by something cool,</p>
      <p>and a seed makes us feel like we need to go back school.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>That's when you know you have something fun,</p>
      <p>something that will challenge you until you are done.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>A challenge is a wonderful quest,</p>
      <p>something that will keep you learning until you do your best.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Please, stop walking the same road,</p>
      <p>take your leap of curiosity; learn to paint, or dance, or code.</p>
