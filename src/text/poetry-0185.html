      <p>When you gather a comfortable amount of observation,</p>
      <p>there is a moment when you go from observer to creator.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>It is similar to how you arrive in a new city,</p>
      <p>at first you are unsure, but eventually it becomes your home town.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>In politics, politicians so through something similar,</p>
      <p>but it is a mistake, they become comfortable around manipulators,</p>
      <p>and get comfortable with manipulating, propagating the blight.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>In the world of books, the authors that resonate with you,</p>
      <p>become your friends, Carl Sagan, Bill Bryson, Dan Brown,</p>
      <p>they become family and you get to know them in your own way.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>In world adventures, it is called going native, or emanating mana,</p>
      <p>one moment you are an outsider, and the next you are riding a bull to work,</p>
      <p>where you spend your days working hard on digging new wells,</p>
      <p>hurrying to finish before your visa expires and you have get back to the loud and filthy city.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>When knowledge becomes internalized, it becomes wisdom,</p>
      <p>you become able to synthesize more knowledge out of what you already know,</p>
      <p>some call it Enlightenment.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>It all cases, it is natural, human, simple and easy to get to,</p>
      <p>it is not rare, it is not a power granted only to special people,</p>
      <p>it is a power that makes people more special.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>If you read enough audio books that move you in the same direction,</p>
      <p>you'll go from listening about something to becoming a participant in thinking about it.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>It is a feeling so powerful at first,</p>
      <p>that some become convinced they are geniuses,</p>
      <p>and have deeper knowledge</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>"Nope! that's just your first tipping point dude,</p>
      <p>keep going though, because you are just about as amazing as you think you are, don't stop learning".</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The more tipping points, and plateaus,</p>
      <p>upon which we rests as we move towards the sunny parts of our mountain range.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The more capable we become, the more we can synthesize,</p>
      <p>and the more of the things we synthesize slowly do become unique and amazing.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Finally, the more we know,</p>
      <p>the easier it is to understand other people's works,</p>
      <p>we begin sharing more and more with other creators.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>That's Real Education,</p>
      <p>we become specialists in our own unique corners of the world,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Eventually we too get stung by the urge to share what we know,</p>
      <p>both the unique little discoveries or contributions we made,</p>
      <p>and in memoirs that describe all the twisty little passages that got us there.</p>
