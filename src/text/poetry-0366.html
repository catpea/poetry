    <div class="section">
      <p>I was in a news class,</p>
      <p>one of the kids fell asleep.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The teacher,</p>
      <p>gave him what he called a "wet willy", for which he should have been terminated.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I was supposed to give a speech soon,</p>
      <p>I didn't know enough English yet, I was learning at my own pace.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I walked out of the classroom,</p>
      <p>the teacher was crazy, so I walked out.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The soon to be principal,</p>
      <p>currently involved in creating a class of failures was looking for a control sample.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>He asked me what class I am in,</p>
      <p>why am I in the hall.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I lied,</p>
      <p>"Great!" - he said, "Follow Me".</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>He told me not to worry about the paper work,</p>
      <p>this is my new class.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>There was a poster on the wall that said:</p>
      <p>"Wherever you go there you are".</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We were asked to never say that we feel fine,</p>
      <p>because fine didn't explain how we felt.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And we were supposed to explain to the group what we were feeling for real,</p>
      <p>it was a nice gesture, everyone turned out to be fighting against he currents.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Bad parents, poverty, bullies,</p>
      <p>or in my case crazy teachers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I dropped out from that High School before the class was over,</p>
      <p>I lost credits from several classes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Everyone in that class wished me well, I think they asked me to stay strong, and wished me luck on my journey;</p>
      <p>they saw my dropping out as the beginning of a journey.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>They are all extraordinary people,</p>
      <p>leaders, forces of nature, unbreakable, un-extinguishable, infinitely powerful.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>They were some of the most self-aware students in that entire school,</p>
      <p>and they were not rejects, they were just rejecting in-authenticity.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The soon to become principal was quiet,</p>
      <p>his control sample was dropping out.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But it wouldn't take much for him to figure out that the school was crushing us,</p>
      <p>and there was only one way out of that.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I suspect investigations followed, into the creepy teachers I named,</p>
      <p>though probably no one got fired.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I have a vague memory, of AdultEd principal reaching out,</p>
      <p>I don't remember if it was because I called for a GED, or she found me walking the road, or called me.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I was treated with great kindness,</p>
      <p>and told not to worry about a thing, I think the experimental class teachers told her about me, somehow.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I graduated six months early with extra credits,</p>
      <p>I went on to college, I ended up on the Deans list, or as I call it the 4.0 GPA Student Retention List.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And dropped out, but this time because I took all their good classes which were few,</p>
      <p>I went to work as a programmer - the college didn't have any of those classes - and anyway I learn best, when I study at my own pace and in my own sequence.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>He thought they were all rejects,</p>
      <p>he built a class with all the difficult students.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But they turned out to be some of the wisest and most brilliant and insightful minds in the entire school,</p>
      <p>we must not allow anybody to rob us of our predispositions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We must stand up for real education,</p>
      <p>we must not allow anybody to trick us into thinking that temporary memorization is in some magical way an education.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Lastly, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmoor8DwqW4">the principals know that schools are not teaching</a>.</p>
    </div>
