      <p>IF you can keep your head when all about you</p>
      <p>Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,</p>
      <p>If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,</p>
      <p>But make allowance for their doubting too;</p>
      <p>If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,</p>
      <p>Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,</p>
      <p>Or being hated, don't give way to hating,</p>
      <p>And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>If you can dream - and not make dreams your master;</p>
      <p>If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim;</p>
      <p>If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster</p>
      <p>And treat those two impostors just the same;</p>
      <p>If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken</p>
      <p>Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,</p>
      <p>Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,</p>
      <p>And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>If you can make one heap of all your winnings</p>
      <p>And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,</p>
      <p>And lose, and start again at your beginnings</p>
      <p>And never breathe a word about your loss;</p>
      <p>If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew</p>
      <p>To serve your turn long after they are gone,</p>
      <p>And so hold on when there is nothing in you</p>
      <p>Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,</p>
      <p>' Or walk with Kings - nor lose the common touch,</p>
      <p>if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,</p>
      <p>If all men count with you, but none too much;</p>
      <p>If you can fill the unforgiving minute</p>
      <p>With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,</p>
      <p>Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,</p>
      <p>And - which is more - you'll be a Man, my son!</p>
