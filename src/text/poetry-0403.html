      <p>Creating works of art is not the only way to make money in Art,</p>
      <p>creating an Art Book, is not that different from creating a work of art.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And one very interesting thing about art books is that,</p>
      <p>the simpler the better.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The art book I have in mind is both, a number of tutorials,</p>
      <p>and a selection of artworks, including behind the scene photos.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The tutorials would describe your own art style,</p>
      <p>from your favorite brand of pencils, to tips and tricks that you have learned along the way.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Artworks with behind the scene photos,</p>
      <p>would show a progression from sketch to finished work.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>One interesting feature would be photos of your drawing desk,</p>
      <p>with all the things that you use, all spread out with interesting little notes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Some artists take it a step further,</p>
      <p>and they use the photos for drawing reference, creating a drawing of their desk.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The equipment section of the Art Book</p>
      <p>becomes a work of art it self.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Creating an Art Book is a wonderful learning experience,</p>
      <p>and will offer plenty of opportunities to go from pencils to mixed media.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>There are many tutorial and art books out there,</p>
      <p>it may take a while to find a publisher.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But keep in mind, that well made educational books.</p>
      <p>are worth their weight in gold.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I think a fine Art Book serves as an outstanding Art Portfolio as well,</p>
      <p>one that would easily convince many galleries to display and sell your art.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Creating your own Art Book will capture your progression as an artist,</p>
      <p>you can always update it with new works.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Plus, it carries the digitized versions of your works,</p>
      <p>here the paper never gets old, it is a snapshot in time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>As you sell your artworks, or retire some of them,</p>
      <p>they will remain forever young in your Art Book.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And finally, an Art Book is a magical object that will call you back to Art,</p>
      <p>should life ever get too complex, or too busy.</p>
    </div>
