    <div class="section">
      <p>Every step you take brings your mind closer,</p>
      <p>to Wisdom, Enlightenment, and Greatness.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You are not a worker, you are not an employee,</p>
      <p>you are not poor, you are not ugly, and you do not lack intelligence.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We are all short for more Knowledge,</p>
      <p>the path of knowledge that leads to Wisdom, Enlightenment and Greatness... is called growing up.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>For all our differences,</p>
      <p>we are all headed in the same direction.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We are all to converge on wisdom,</p>
      <p>in Peace, Dignity and Beauty, and with Foresight or Enlightenment.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We can all agree that the more we know,</p>
      <p>the more we grow.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>That acquisition of knowledge changes us,</p>
      <p>transform us, brings us closer together.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And like Night follows the Day,</p>
      <p>this applies backwards too.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Nations, Peoples, Cultures, Religions,</p>
      <p>fight one another, because Knowledge - the path to Wisdom and Enlightenment and Greatness - has been denied to them.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Blinded by poverty and rage,</p>
      <p>they never have time to consider who they would be, if they were born to the enemy that they stand against.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>What would their truths be,</p>
      <p>had they been born to another Culture.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>If they do ask this simple question,</p>
      <p>they will realize than not only have they been mislead, but their enemy too.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And that there is nothing to fight about,</p>
      <p>that we are all in this together.</p>

      <p>you are meant to lead your generation forward.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And you are meant to inspire the one that is soon to follow,</p>
      <p>you are meant to be a True Royalty, not one to wear a crown of metal, but one to help the world converge on Wisdom, in Unity, in Peace.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You are not an employee,</p>
      <p>and we are each already born a student.</p>

      <p>The symphony of Crickets and Frogs is meant to serve as the background,</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You have to rise against stress and let it slide off of you,</p>
      <p>you are infinite and beautiful, and there is no end to how loudly your works can speak.</p>

      <p>You are meant to learn and grow to no end,</p>
