    <div class="section">
      <p>So today, I will show you how to compose your own songs,</p>
      <p>with your own lyrics.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We have a talent that you may not be aware of,</p>
      <p>it is the talent of synchronizing with a metronome, or a simple beat.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Here, you just turn in on for one minute,</p>
      <p>and then come up with a thought that moves you.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And then try to speak your wave-like-thought,</p>
      <p>in the mathematically square melody of the metronome or the beat.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>If something goes wrong, and your song isn't coming together,</p>
      <p>you will need a melody to guide you.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Come up with your own,</p>
      <p>just while something to a beat.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And then when you get stuck with lyrics,</p>
      <p>coming apart on you, return to composing a thought to your whistle, your root melody.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    <div class="section">
      <p>You must use your own lyrics,</p>
      <p>you must use your own thoughts.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You can speak from your heart,</p>
      <p>but you have to use short words.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Because if you use really long words,</p>
      <p>then the song is going to sound really strange.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But you can use them in a way, so as long as you split them up,</p>
      <p>try your luck with "met-ro-nome", it doesn't always sound that bad.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But creating lyrics,</p>
      <p>is about finding a path trough a maze.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>So if a word does not fit right,</p>
      <p>then find one that will shine some light.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Here is a little example:</p>
      <p>*recursive example...*</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Here is a short song I made out of the titles and thoughts behind my recent poems,</p>
      <p>I must warn you, this is not a masterpiece.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But, this is <a href="/audio/trying-to-sing.mp3">the first song I sing on my own</a>,</p>
      <p>next time, I will spend some more time on the lyrics.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I will come up with a melody,</p>
      <p>that the lyrics will click with.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And I'll combine the lyrics with the drum in the back,</p>
      <p>so that as the big drum hits, the lyric will hit too.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>My voice here has no special filtering,</p>
      <p>it just has some big-room re-verb, and I sung a tone lower.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I don't have a very good piano here,</p>
      <p>the few things I tried sounded miserable, so I ended up using an old synthesizer.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But, I recommend using Piano and Violin,</p>
      <p>it would make things sound much nicer.</p>
    </div>

      <p>No Limits</p>
      <p>by General Catpea</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You don't need to know the theory</p>
      <p>you don't need to know which books.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You were born into endless world.</p>
      <p>and you are meant to grow.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We are all meant to travel,</p>
      <p>to the most distant suns.</p>

      <p>Humanity will forever grow,</p>
      <p>and the Universe is our friend.</p>

      <p>Every one of us is a rare genius,</p>
      <p>and we can each reach to no end.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>There are no limits to our dream,</p>
      <p>we can each reach highest ends.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We must each search for wisdom,</p>
      <p>we must never be denied.</p>
