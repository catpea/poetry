      <p>However long it is going to be,</p>
      <p>however magnificent.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It will be just one,</p>
      <p>it will start in the beginning and go as far as it can into the future.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>There is no time here to stay down, or stay scared, or live simple, or dream plain,</p>
      <p>you have one life to live, and the only rule here, is that it is lived to the fullest, and most fulfilling.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Every one of you days must add to the Magnificent Whole,</p>
      <p>sometimes to your body, sometimes to your mind, sometimes to your wisdom, and your dreams.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But you never stay down,</p>
      <p>there is nothing more powerful than a Human Rising.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Sometimes life is hell,</p>
      <p>bunt then we learn to twist and bend and avoid the punches.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And sometimes even strike back,</p>
      <p>but never without having won the battle first.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Sometimes life is a dream,</p>
      <p>and then we have to cross the Appalachian Trail, Run Western States.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And sometimes even face a black bear or a cougar,</p>
      <p>with a Superhuman growl that will hurt our throat for a day and a half.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    <div class="section">
      <p>Wherever we start,</p>
      <p>we never stay down when facing life's challenges.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Even when committed to a bed,</p>
      <p>we continue rising until our arms grow strong and the nurses grow worried.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is to transform,</p>
      <p>which is the meaning of the words: growing up.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I know you want to know what it all for,</p>
      <p>and that you are unsatisfied when you hear that the answer is about Human Dignity and Nobility.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The transformation is harder to explain,</p>
      <p>because you transform into a being that is higher than who you are right now.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Mistakes that we learn from,</p>
      <p>cease being mistakes, and as we grow we become wise enough to not make mistakes at all.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Our attention then turns to the world,</p>
      <p>we try to help the people of the world grow the same way we grew.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>This is why the transformation is frequently described as Human Dignity and Nobility,</p>
      <p>because Humans are meant to become Peaceful Warriors, Inspirational Teachers, Powerful Thinkers, Lovers of Wisdom, and Great Beings.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>When they are denied their Dignity and Nobility,</p>
      <p>they are put at a great disadvantage, and our world and all the creates in it are put in harms way.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>To help the world grow,</p>
      <p>you have to become a Great Being and inspire the others to discover their own path towards the Great Human Dignity and Nobility.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>In turn, they have to inspire others,</p>
      <p>and to no end, and that is the only way that Humanity Can Grow.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Human beings have many superpowers,</p>
      <p>Knowledge, Philosophy and Her Daughters, The Sciences, Foresight and Insight, and Great Visions Of The Future.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Time has come, to stop tolerating ineffective or fake education,</p>
      <p>and stop waiting for an imaginary Superman.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Our civilization has reached a point where we must begin reminding each other,</p>
      <p>that we are _all_ meant to become Great Beings.</p>
    </div>
