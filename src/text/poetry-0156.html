      <p>I woke up at five,</p>
      <p>and I felt alive.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I left at five forty two,</p>
      <p>I could still smell the dew.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The sun was still down,</p>
      <p>and the clouds looked brown.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>But I ran,</p>
      <p>like Superman.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I had weights in each hand,</p>
      <p>ready to conquer Westland.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Though by the time I got to Central City,</p>
      <p>I felt just about as strong as a little kitty.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>But I kept going,</p>
      <p>and the sky started glowing.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>It was really pretty,</p>
      <p>...the sunrise finally came to the city.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>There was a cloud or two,</p>
      <p>but that only added to the view.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I ran much faster, like I had superpowers,</p>
      <p>and made the six miles under two hours.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>It is my best time thus far,</p>
      <p>and I felt like a superstar.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>But, I have a lot more training to do,</p>
      <p>...though I must say, I already grew.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I love how I am making proggres jooging</p>
      <p>and bodybuilding and blogging...</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>...and all at the same time,</p>
      <p>that sure is a lot of adventure and rhyme.</p>
