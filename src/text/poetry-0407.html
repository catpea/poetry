    <div class="section">
      <p>The Trembling Giant is a clonal colony of aspen determined to be a single living organism,</p>
      <p>and assumed to have one massive underground root system, it contains 47,000 trees.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>This text is about taking your first beautiful company,</p>
      <p>with an imaginative and eye catching product...</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And then making a much more powerful business out of it,</p>
      <p>by selling its clones to many business people.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Where your original product sold for $29.99,</p>
      <p>the clones of companies that make that product will bring you a much greater figure.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>A company represents a dream, people will pay for the upfront setup,</p>
      <p>and then pay you monthly until the company is fully paid off.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>So you go from $29.99 to relatively impossibly-large-figures,</p>
      <p>by simply abandoning your product and selling copies of your company.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Now, here a hardened business person will check me,</p>
      <p>no doubt to share a wisdom valuable for brick and mortar shops.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And here comes the first warning, do not open a physical location,</p>
      <p>and don't deal with anything that requires a warehouse.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Let me make that clear, no physical goods, no building improvements and remodeling, no cleaning supplies, no employee uniforms,</p>
      <p>no equipment repairs and maintenance, no HVAC maintenance, no miscellaneous supplies, no mortgage or lease payments, no physical location,</p>
      <p>no signage, no utilities; or it will bleed you dry and push you into a bankruptcy (which is much better than school loans)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Do not create a business that will consume your company,</p>
      <p>if it stops making money for a few months.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You have to create a machine that only comes to life when a sale is made,</p>
      <p>that only extracts fees from a ready made sale.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Remember, you are selling copies of this company,</p>
      <p>your customers should only see a simple relationship between advertising and sales, that is it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The company must be easily operated via the internet,</p>
      <p>and as 2020 taught us great emphasis should be placed on telecommuting, or remote jobs.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Artificial Intelligence is not going to get here any time soon,</p>
      <p>if anything AI is just a stupid trick that corporations use to cut expenses by replacing employees with touchscreens for customers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And AI can only emerge of out accidents,</p>
      <p>it will not be a system that will be able to improve it self, it will never know how it works.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>There are Eight Billion People out there,</p>
      <p>an you are building a lightweight company that only calls for employees when something needs to be done.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>This could mean that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNpx7gpSqbY">the company goes dormant during incompatible times</a>,</p>
      <p>or that you keep employing more and more and more and more, but only when there is more and more work to be done.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>As the job queue becomes smaller,</p>
      <p>the number of workers you employ in your template company will scale down.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Once you sell 1,000 such companies, 1,000 copies of that original,</p>
      <p>the regulars won't really care if they are working for a clone in Bangalore, Johannesburg, or Rio.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Premature optimization and automation is your friend,</p>
      <p>squeeze everything down to the most robotic and lightweight implementation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>That will be your seed,</p>
      <p>you will now be able to see what is constricting it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Too much automation, not enough variability,</p>
      <p>impossible growth due to over optimization in a particular fragment.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>All of these anomalies reveal pathways towards growth,</p>
      <p>and whatever does function in its lightweight mode can only make the company better.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Let us look at that original business, the template,</p>
      <p>if that is all you wanted to build, you would aim for something that makes more than $10,000 month.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But now that you are building a network of clones,</p>
      <p>you have to ask how much does a clone-company like that need-to-make-a-month to sell well.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It could be 1,000 with minimal advertising,</p>
      <p>there are millions of people in this world who would be happy to make 1,000 a month.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>How much should you sell a 1,000 a month company for,</p>
      <p>maybe $24,000, maybe $50,000.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And how are those people going to pay that sum?</p>
      <p>now listen carefully.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You are not allowed to put people desperate for money,</p>
      <p>in more debt, the banks that used to do that employed the worst kinds of human beings.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>They will pay you with a fair percent of their monthly income,</p>
      <p>if $100 is all they will make on that particular month, then all you will get is a $10 towards that $24,000.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Make sure to hold up the banks that stole whatever money poor people had left,</p>
      <p>as an example of who not to do business with.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>In the end, come your age of wisdom, building a company that does nothing to help poor people,</p>
      <p>is not worth your time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>That clever $1 down to trap a person into a legally binding contract,</p>
      <p>is a disgrace, an insult, and just as predatory as relying on bounced checks and other customer fees for a big share of your profits.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>
    <p>Now, the easy part,</p>
    <p>as to the structure of your company...</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Don't invent anything new,</p>
      <p>clone what others wish they could own.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>After all, your business is about selling clones of a fetching company,</p>
      <p>and later on, about letting your clients pick from many templates of successful companies.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I am convinced many of your clients will own multiple clones,</p>
      <p>and they will use them to reinforce one another.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>On the front-end, are things that make the customer of a clone company happy,</p>
      <p>on the back-end is the administrator zone, AND! a place for freelancers to perform whatever actions the company needs to grow.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>For example, imagine City Photography, Inc,</p>
      <p>which is patterned after <a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a> owned by two teenager co-founders.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>They are coordinating photography projects from all the cities in United States,</p>
      <p>all the photographs are free to use without registration, the participating photographers, can win awards, get a beautiful portfolio and job experience.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>This company makes money from product and business placement,</p>
      <p>from the brand names that models wear, and the cars that appear in exclusive photos.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>These two teenagers, want to photograph all the landmarks in United States,</p>
      <p>and they can achieve that by putting a small monetary bounty on particular landmarks.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>They may request slow motion video, time lapse photography, tilt shift photography,</p>
      <p>areal drone photography, and set the bounties as needed.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Over time, they will discover more ways of monetizing,</p>
      <p>because monetization depends on their users.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>For example, City Photography, Inc can allow its users to give each other Monetary Tips, including monthly,</p>
      <p>and then take a small percentage of that, this would represent maybe 5% of their moneymaking.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>There would be many more ways that City Photography, Inc takes an unobtrusive cut of something,</p>
      <p>this may include brand names advertising their labels on the front page, popular users paying for a spotlight and so on.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>City Photography, Inc may grow, it maybe purchased by a larger company as the case it with Unsplash,</p>
      <p>or it may fade away releasing all its photographs to Web Archive, or similar under the Public Domain license.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The number one deciding factor for what will happen to a company is the chaos and randomness of the business world,</p>
      <p>the number two deciding factor is timing, if high quality photography is something that the world is interested in, then they will thrive.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The end of life for City Photography, Inc,</p>
      <p>is just a new beginning for out two co-founders, no longer teenagers now, but just as sharp and passionate about business and big dreams.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>They will take to another type of business you sell,</p>
      <p>as they will now be intricately familiar with what it is like to engage in running a company, with a remote-work back-end that cater to freelancers around the world.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>In closing,</p>
      <p>create a beautiful little company, have fun with it, and when you are done covert it into a template,</p>
      <p>and begin selling clones of that company to others.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Don't stop here, look to other businesses that are fun to use, launch, run,</p>
      <p>and copy them, bring in their template into your system so that people that buy companies from you can have multiple choices.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And don't be evil, don't bother with companies that do nothing for those who live in poverty,</p>
      <p>they are not worth your time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Come your final days, no matter how many times you will say to yourself "I made a difference",</p>
      <p>you will never fully believe it, unless you truly did make a different, unless you truly did grow to become a Great Being that helped the world grow.</p>
