      <p>Humanity can only grow by looking into its heart,</p>
      <p>and slowly learning Philosophy, Sciences, and Art.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>It is easy.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>It is what the modern non-fiction is all about,</p>
      <p>just, grab an audio book and go all out.</p>

      <p>Hey, you don't need any reasons,</p>
      <p>to become a connoisseur of the Seasons!</p>

      <p>In Autumn, only read about Mother Nature,</p>
      <p>and modern Adventure.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>In Winter, focus on Philosophy and Art,</p>
      <p>so that come spring you are always chipper and smart.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>In Spring, you must absolutely read about Inner Strength,</p>
      <p>mostly memoirs just to see how a human can go to great length.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>In Summer, read or listen about our History,</p>
      <p>how countless great beings fought for Unity, Wisdom and Glory.</p>

      <p>The world is worthy of our love,</p>
      <p>we should each transcend out limits, high and above.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>We must all reach for knowledge and wisdom and awake,</p>
      <p>forget leaders we can't ever know if they are true or fake.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We are one family, one world, one nation,</p>
      <p>and the only thing dividing us is lack of education.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is really hard to see,</p>
      <p>how powerful Knowledge and Wisdom can be.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Maybe, think of it as knowledge received,</p>
      <p>from lives you have not lived.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Once we all take to wisdom, real education will become first,</p>
      <p>then we'll unite, and take down all the nuclear missiles that have us cursed.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Only then will we know,</p>
      <p>how far is humanity able to go.</p>
