      <p>I went bicycling today,</p>
      <p>but I was lost in thoughts all day.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I thought about Typography and Art,</p>
      <p>and how evey Human Being is really smart.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>How people get busy,</p>
      <p>and how life is rarely easy.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>How we get tired, how creativity is made,</p>
      <p>otherwise it will just fade.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>How there is only ever time for big things,</p>
      <p>it matters not if its vagabonds or kings.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We are all limited in time,</p>
      <p>we truly are meant to learn, become wise and climb.</p>

      <p>Now, I am ready for bed,</p>
      <p>I really feel tired.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>I am already packed for my morning run,</p>
      <p>the weather says, no rain, only sun.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Though, I've noticed it will snow,</p>
      <p>at the Rocky Mountains... but that's good to know.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Because you can't ever be too far away from that,</p>
      <p>I am pretty far away, and glad.</p>
