    <p>It will bring light wherever there is darkness,</p>
    <p>it will light up the City Streets and help our vision.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>It will bring us words when we are tired,</p>
    <p>it will bring us strength when we canâ€™t go no more.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>It is good for a million things,</p>
    <p>and it does make us Unbreakable.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>There are so many ways to inherit wisdom.</p>
    <p>But, the best we can do, in chaos, and noise, and haste, and poverty, is books.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>The stories of Wisdom in Lectures and Audio Books,</p>
    <p>and the Super Humanity they bring to us.</p>

    <p>To the Cries of the Philosophers,</p>
    <p>the schools have become heartless machines.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>Processing plants, pushing humans along,</p>
    <p>to more poverty, more stress, more sacrifice, more achy bones.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>Just, say, no, because you are not that simple, and your life is too precious,</p>
    <p>just say no to the ordinary, to the plain, to the push along, play along, force fed mornings.</p>

  <section>
    <p>Go to the library, find a way to find all the Audio Books that will move you,</p>
    <p>go to the beach and just listen how each and every great being rejected that ordinary life.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>Oh, it cost them all the worthless grades, and all the office space and windows one could ever wish for,</p>
    <p>but it granted them Freedom, Greatness of Mind, Vastness of Oceans, and Content of Character.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>Please, break away from the ordinary life,</p>
    <p>it is just a play along, live along fantasy meant to lull you to sleep.</p>

  <section>
    <p>You are meant to be a Force of Nature,</p>
    <p>a Wave of Change, of Aspiration and Inspiration.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>Do not go quietly into old age, do not let years and decades pass you by, they only move one way,</p>
    <p>take to books and adventures, sleep by lakes, travel by boat, by bicycle, swim and distance run.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>Do not let a moment go by, tick by irreplaceable tock, sleep in the storm and awake to thunder,</p>
    <p>may each and every irreplaceable moment of your life become a shiny little precious gemstone.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>You must become a great being,</p>
    <p>do not let the ordinary life trick you, Greatness it is your Right!</p>
