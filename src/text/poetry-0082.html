      <p>Not Until This, Not Until That</p>
      <p>Don't let anybody push you around,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>If you allow negativity towards you for long enough,</p>
      <p>it will make you very ill.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Tolerance of negativity will push you to cross lines,</p>
      <p>it will derail you the same way that lies derail liars.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>It is like the lines that addicts cross,</p>
      <p>until there is no way to come back.</p>

      <p>Take a look into the mind of the person negative towards you,</p>
      <p>do they even see you as a person?</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>If their ultimate aim is not to rob you of yourself to turn you into a tool,</p>
      <p>then are you not some disposable mean to their shortcuts.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Nothing is found in servitude, it won't make you stronger,</p>
      <p>it won't make you nobler, or enlightened, or worthy.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Protect your mind, reject being pushed around,</p>
      <p>stand up, rise, do not follow, no one has any control over you.</p>

      <p>You become Stronger when you rise,</p>
      <p>when you put your feet down on the ground, and push up - to the mountains.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>You become Nobler when you break away,</p>
      <p>when you let go of those ahead of you, and take your own path to the side.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>You become Wise and Enlightened when you stand your ground Memoirs in hand,</p>
      <p>when you learn from the lessons on your own path, and by subtle analogy to other paths.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>You become Worthy, of Yourself, of Love, of Wisdom, of a house you can call Home,</p>
      <p>when you grow protecting who you are, onward to becoming the best You.</p>

      <p>Do not be scared, because if you stay scared, nothing will change,</p>
      <p>do not let sadness keep you in bed, go to the library first.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Do not let the sick thick stickiness to keep you bound,</p>
      <p>most of it is illusion, including the few pleasures you found.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Do net let alligator tears, and hollow souls void of any content howl you back,</p>
      <p>you are not part of that world, you never were.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Do not go slowly wandering down their own paths, that's how <em>they</em> were created,</p>
      <p>and you can still reject that agony and become free.</p>

      <p>your Innocence, your Sweetness, your Love, your Cuteness, your Generosity, your Might, your Endurance.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Those are powerful treasures meant to help you become a Great Being,</p>
      <p>treasures that they have forsaken in their own selves.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Now they are trying to forsaken your own treasures, to fuhrer the dark path they dig,</p>
      <p>do not let them take what is irreplaceable within you.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>You cannot aid them in any way, that can only feed their evil,</p>
      <p>and take away from your Beautiful Treasures.</p>

      <p>go see someone singing with their beautiful voice.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Write in your journal, record on your phone, sharpen your pencil,</p>
      <p>use tracing paper to learn how to draw.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Step after step courageously walk down the isles to get your first air dry clay,</p>
      <p>and sculpt, sculpt your world, and touch, and feeling, show the world.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Do not hide, reject the bad, and shine among the crowds,</p>
      <p>do not let your older-self cry that you were never seen.</p>
