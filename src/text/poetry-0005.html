      <p>Grow strong, my comrade … that you may stand</p>
      <p>Unshaken when I fall; that I may know</p>
      <p>The shattered fragments of my song will come</p>
      <p>At last to finer melody in you;</p>
      <p>That I may tell my heart that you begin</p>
      <p>Where passing I leave off, and fathom more.”</p>
