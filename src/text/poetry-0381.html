      <p>We are each a unique creature,</p>
      <p>so what I felt won't be what you will feel when you are there.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But there are some things</p>
      <p>that may be similar.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>There are more than 218 moons in our solar system,</p>
      <p>each one is an edge, just like the beach at Nordhouse is an edge.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is really,</p>
      <p>just about the same place, gravity doesn't matter much since you are elated anyway.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You are royalty,</p>
      <p>out on your very own Moon.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is important that you have paper an pen,</p>
      <p>make sure your notes resist getting wet, test it, things can get wet out there.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The journal, is for a single compound sentence type things,</p>
      <p>it is good to write it down.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Though you can't possibly forget it,</p>
      <p>but if you did, the thought would come back to you.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The journal is so that you can scribble a big thought,</p>
      <p>and move on to the bigger one.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Some example observations maybe...</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>"Schools are not teaching, tests aren't testing knowledge,</p>
      <p>diplomas are bunk, colleges are a business, and the whole thing is a scam."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>"Uneducated voters are easily swayed by all the things that uneducated,</p>
      <p>have always showed to be passionate about, racism, nationalism, hate, and us vs. them logic."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>"Military targets young boys, because it is easy, because they are easily impressed,</p>
      <p>they don't know enough about the world nor will they know war until it is too late;</p>
      <p>fathers are sending their children to kill each other in wars about thing that they ruined."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>"The Thirteenth Amendment of United States, may force those who participate in Jury Duty,</p>
      <p>into participating in slavery, as a slaver."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>"Criminal who are fractured by the bony hands of poverty,</p>
      <p>are not themselves, they are they are victimized by poverty and the denial of even the most basic human rights."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>"The unforgivable by the desperate act of bankruptcy, College Debt,</p>
      <p>alters the meaning of money, a meaning already eroded by the worst of human ideas,</p>
      <p>unforgivable debt makes what is owed void, and invalid, it is just a sick version of money that isn't real."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>"Government paying colleges for student debt, to save the students from it, is a temporary fix;</p>
      <p>asking why colleges charge so much money, is not even the right question,</p>
      <p>"Do colleges teach?", is the correct question."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>"Poverty and Lack of Education, has brought progress down to a stop,</p>
      <p>countries that fought for freedom with great vision,</p>
      <p>are falling back down for lack of it,</p>
      <p>that vision can only be found in real education, in real wisdom that opens gateways to greatness."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>These observations never end... some of them are a little crooked,</p>
      <p>you may not have a full picture.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But once you make the observation,</p>
      <p>you will become sensitive to all the subjects that stand in support of it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You won't make wrong observations,</p>
      <p>just ones that need more information.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>If there is something that is really calling to you,</p>
      <p>like Philosophy called to me.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Then just get 15 audio books about it,</p>
      <p>sometimes books that don't come out well as audio books, are just not that good.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Audio books,</p>
      <p>may just mark the elite of books worth investing time it,</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Einstein said,</p>
      <p>"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>So if a book doesn't explain something valuable and magnificent, simply,</p>
      <p>it probably relates to another quote which goes:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>"There's a sucker born every minute"</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>So just keep an eye out for the fake charts,</p>
      <p>designed to sell garbage meant to pray on uneducated readers,</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Or charts that that see nothing wrong when the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Politicians+Buy+Their+Own+Books">pseudo-authors buy their own books with campaign money</a>,</p>
      <p>and then use the profits from book sales to launder the money further.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The beautiful thing about real books,</p>
      <p>is that they help you figure out who the world's true leaders are.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>They often greatly admire each other,</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DKhc1pcDFM">so once you find one</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J4QPz52Sfo">there will be a bunch more</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You can see what happens,</p>
      <p>out on the edge.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You pull yourself out by your own bootstraps,</p>
      <p>from all the noise and chaos that you accepted because you were too young to question it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I still remember the teacher saying "You need to learn math because you won't always have a calculator on hand",</p>
      <p><a href="https://github.com/catpea/math-as-code">but what I was saying was: you need a computer to learn math for real</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Because I could see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDZ26vj4vFM">there was real fun to be had with mathematics it truly is a beautiful invention</a>,</p>
      <p>but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YokKp3pwVFc">teaching formulas without explanation is destroys that beauty, math teachers in their madness are destroying the beauty of mathematics</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>One of the anchors that helps me remember problems in middle school,</p>
      <p>is being accused of cheating on homework, the teacher gave me a bad grade for an impressive (if I may) program I wrote my self.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>This made my bullies laugh at me, of course,</p>
      <p>they saw me pacing up and down the enormous corridors writing that program on a piece of paper for days.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>In some cases,</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxyKNMrhEvY">school can easily destroy us</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The damage caused by fantasy education of nonsense-lecture-and-brainless-test is unspeakable,</p>
      <p>pretty much everything broken right now, is because the schools are broken.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I write this in 2021 as the vaccines are just about to become accessible,</p>
      <p>the vaccine hesitancy problem that is about to be reveled is a perfect example of the damage fake education has caused.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Just to make it more personal, after the masks are no longer going to be required, you will see husbands bringing the virus home,</p>
      <p>and making their family sick, because their level of education trickles them into thinking the "vaccines has problems", or to quote another case "vaccines have chemicals".</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The gravity of the damage, can bring down entire nations,</p>
      <p>without anybody noticing what has gone wrong and where; they will still talk about paying off college debt and giving more money to the teachers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Nobody in politics will notice, or believe, that schools have caused this,</p>
      <p>because it is too complicated for their context, outside of their field of whatever.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>More than the middle school, or calculator nonsense, our parents are doing something similar where it comes to College and Career,</p>
      <p>the correct path is Real Education and Entrepreneurship.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>College and Career are so popular, and there is so much money in this,</p>
      <p>that there was never a chance that this could withstand corruption.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Getting fired should not be a threat,</p>
      <p>getting replaced by younger, or just more cunning employees should not be a threat in your life.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You need a better plan than College and Career,</p>
      <p>and a life where you can live in balance, and with a solid grasp on reality.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>By this time,</p>
      <p>you'll have a fire going, you don't always have to go to the beach to watch the sunset.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You maybe, sharpening a stick,</p>
      <p>a sausage can be a pretty tasty treat after a day of going up and down dunes in search of some mysterious lost lake, or leg of trail, or just following a goose.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>See, your thoughts no longer flow from the middle out,</p>
      <p>they now come from the edge, they get under the things.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>you don't just look at what is before you,</p>
      <p>but that the many hings that connect to it, that may dictate the future ahead of you.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It if feels like you are a Castaway,</p>
      <p>it is only because Humans are not meant to be alone, we are tribal creatures.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Your Audio Books, will connect you with the others,</p>
      <p>and you will know deep down that they are important enough to override that curse of the cast away, your soul needs Philosophy and Wisdom.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Since it is a small wilderness, or later on a popular trail like the AT,</p>
      <p>you won't feel like a Castaway for long, your Audio Books will be connecting you to all the world's true leaders, it won't feel lonely.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But, if you have friends,</p>
      <p>bring them along.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It rained pretty bad once, and then a thunderstorm came,</p>
      <p>this is exactly what you should expect to find, out on the edge.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You are now part of the universe,</p>
      <p>might as well be camping on a distant moon.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Make sure that flash floods won't wash away any of your gear,</p>
      <p>and find a spot where it is safe when a great storm comes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Check for trees that are about to fall, and keep away from those,</p>
      <p>if you can't find a good spot, then know of a safe spot where you can move on a rainy day.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>A great storm, is terrifying,</p>
      <p>but it is also a great honor.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Every other Adventurer and Creature of Renaissance before you,</p>
      <p>had to endure storms just as big, plan ahead, enjoy the fragrance of the woods.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I curled up in my sleeping bag,</p>
      <p>put on my headphones and started playing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGK84Poeynk">We Are All Connected</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I didn't wait for the storm to pass,</p>
      <p>the headphones were enough to dull the thunder.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I fell asleep to the storm,</p>
      <p>it wasn't that uncomfortable.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>In the morning everything seemed greener,</p>
      <p>I think there were deer by the lake.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It was chilly, but just as soon as the sun comes out from behind the ancient dune, things will warm up,</p>
      <p>and you can take a walk to a sunny spot.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>One time I saw a storm on the horizon,</p>
      <p>it looked beautiful, but I got scared, it didn't even occur to me that it was probably too far, there were no clouds overhead.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>My plan was to back up and run for the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/uyJTDb7TLimJfqiLA">trail end</a>, which I did and I just slept there in my little tent,</p>
      <p>even though the storm did not come.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I was sure it would, because I think, I am pretty sure, maybe, the grass had a very faint bluish outline,</p>
      <p>which seemed to me like static electricity and a sign of trouble.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It looked very beautiful,</p>
      <p>it looked very magical.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But with a storm flashing out on the horizon,</p>
      <p>I wasn't taking any chances, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/6VbSgS27hpvCvHMV8">I was right by the lake</a>, on top of a little dune with a larger camping spot right behind it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>If I was lightening,</p>
      <p>that was the spot I would hit first, so. I. moved.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>In the morning I had the pleasure of looking for a new spot,</p>
      <p>and I found one, that reminded me of a top of a volcano.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I spent many days there daydreaming, and listening to books,</p>
      <p>I had a paper copy of Robinson Cruse and I lazily read that too.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I didn't really pack up and drive away,</p>
      <p>I went to the other parking site on Forest Trail, I slept at the State Park again.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I only packed up to leave,</p>
      <p>when leaving was all that was left.</p>
