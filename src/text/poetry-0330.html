    <div class="section">
      <p>You will have to use bots similar to 2020 Apple Siri,</p>
      <p>and get everyone to participate in answering new questions in the background.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>On the surface it will appear like your bot is talking,</p>
      <p>but beneath it will be the students and some minimal faculty building a knowledge base.</p>

      <p>Make sure all those who lost faith in Humanity,</p>

      <p>The ultimate aim for a modern and evolved school,</p>
      <p>is to pay its students.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>In a world where schools are selling out students for a small profit,</p>
      <p>you are not going to have trouble finding students wanting to get paid.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Funding your operation will be your first problem,</p>
      <p>as you are only allowed to use money of long-term professional investors at first.</p>

      <p>Except, for yours, and you will begin with:</p>
      <p>"I am going to pay my students a living wage.".</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>"I will build a framework, to support my students for a few years,</p>
      <p>and then take 10% percent of my successful graduate's long term earnings."</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>"The struggling ones will never pay,</p>
      <p>nor will they need to pay back."</p>

      <p>"Where I will fail my successors will take over"</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Tell them that the school motto is based on the West Point honor code,</p>
      <p>which it self is based on something much nobler.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Think about the military budget,</p>
      <p>now think how much more important is the school.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Now scale the military funding by that number,</p>
      <p>that will be your starting figure.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Then you go international,</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Your successor will need to negotiate with some 195 nations,</p>
