      <p>Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Twenty Six,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I eat with metal chopsticks.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I stopped using forks,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>to munch my porks.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I don't even know how long ago it was,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>so long ago, I forgot the cause.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I own two metal chopsticks,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>and they work as good as fingers.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I use them to eat my salads,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>to scoop out Jelly and Peanut Butter,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I kid you not, I even use them as a little cutter.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>A dull stick is just fine to turn a sausage in two.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And of course, I stir many a tea, or protein brew.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I do not miss the dangerous forks,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>though once, in a blue moon,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I wish, I owned a spoon.</p>
