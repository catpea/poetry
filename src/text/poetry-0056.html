      <p>Bicycling some years ago, out thirty miles away,</p>
      <p>along a road, and an ancient highway.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I found an overpass where I could perch upon,</p>
      <p>and I discovered I wasn't really alone.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I figured it was the a huge love story,</p>
      <p>about a boy named Harold and a girl named Wally.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>She was a Book Worm, a Hero, and a Graffiti Artist,</p>
      <p>and Harold loved her because she was the Smartest!</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Wally fell in love with Harold,</p>
      <p>as she knew he was a Poet with a Heart of Gold.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>In 1980 some 40 years ago,</p>
      <p>the two adventurers gave it ago.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>They set off for Center State,</p>
      <p>and that became their Longest Date!</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>It all their walking, it never rained,</p>
      <p>and it never too sunny, neither complained.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>They waked holding hands together for a hundred miles,</p>
      <p>their adventure was amazing, nothing but smiles.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>When they finally arrived at Mount Pleasant,</p>
      <p>Harold quietly gave Wally her present.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>It was a little book of foolish rhyme,</p>
      <p>that Harold wrote over a long stretch of time.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>They both just happily turned 57,</p>
      <p>their life together is pure Heaven.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Both are super smart, extremely young, and very strong,</p>
      <p>their sweet love for each other, is lifelong.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>They still do their Mount Pleasant walk,</p>
      <p>holding hands for days, sleeping-in until nine o'clock.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Harold makes really, really good Vegan Lettuce Wraps,</p>
      <p>and Wally is a master at reading Maps.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>They've been to all kinds of interesting places,</p>
      <p>and they always arrive with beaming and smiling faces.</p>
    </section>
