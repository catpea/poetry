      <p>Your Earthly Lineage begun some four billions years ago,</p>
      <p>you ancestors weren't human, they couldn't even breathe Oxygen.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>We gradually adapted to changing conditions,</p>
      <p>to chemical composition of our Little Lonesome Blue Earth.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>In a mere Hundred Million years, we will be as different from who we are today,</p>
      <p>as a Shrew is different from a Great Ape.</p>

      <p>But, one thing will never change,</p>
      <p>and that is how special life that begun on Earth is.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>How colorful and unique our good ideas,</p>
      <p>how different we must be from what life there may be out in space.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>And how incredibly close we all are,</p>
      <p>we are such a tightly knit family, we share so much.</p>

      <p>And we can think without restrictions,</p>
      <p>we don't have short memory, we don't lack imagination.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Our ideas come from nowhere and everywhere,</p>
      <p>we dream about anything and everything, here and everywhere.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>And we have poetry, and paintings, and doodles,</p>
      <p>we have sculptures that are made out of stone and metal.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And above all, we are all born a Royalty, and our proper posture,</p>
      <p>is to rise to the challenge of becoming Philosopher Queens, and Philosopher Kings.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Our consciousness, makes it so that we must rise to no end,</p>
      <p>step after step, book after book, work of art, after a work of art.</p>

      <p>Humanity is in a process of amassing Culture,</p>
      <p>whether we notice it or not, <strong>it is</strong> abandoning bad ideas.</p>
    </div>

      <p>And, You Are Born A Royalty,</p>
      <p>And Your aim, is to become Philosopher Queens, and Kings.</p>

      <p>Say it with me:</p>
