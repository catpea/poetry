      <p>We are all very unique,</p>
      <p>and we are irreplaceable.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But the world is still growing,</p>
      <p>and it may neither fit not truly inspire you.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>So you have to find out what really moves you,</p>
      <p>what makes you stand on unshakable ground.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Accepting the responsibility for your own education,</p>
      <p>you must become authentic and unbreakable.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You have to find what inspires you,</p>
      <p>and carry on, on that path.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Grow and develop and alter your course as fits you best,</p>
      <p>but make sure that each day adds to the previous.</p>

      <p>Do not alter course for unimportant reasons,</p>
      <p>do not let strangers sway you.</p>

      <p>Resist action without thought,</p>
      <p>and resist following orders without thinking.</p>

      <p>Resist red faces, and screaming authority,</p>
      <p>and be careful because mistakes may try to sneak up on you.</p>

      <p>Wisdom is not optional, it is the first and foremost,</p>

      <p>To grow up means to become a Great Being,</p>
      <p>in your Heart, Body, Mind, All of Your Pursuits, and Your Entire Life.</p>

      <p>The path of growing up is built by inheriting wisdom,</p>
      <p>from those of past generations, who have made the same effort.</p>

      <p>Please,</p>
      <p>take to all the books loved by Great Beings,</p>
      <p>and begin where they left off.</p>
