      <p>Myths were invented to describe amazing people,</p>
      <p>and I've seen many amazing creatures in my journeys.</p>

      <p>One time out in Nordhouse,</p>
      <p>out of nowhere popped out a freshly graduated engineer.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>He held up a gallon water container that was carrying back to camp,</p>
      <p>and the poor mad lad uttered, "8.34 pounds".</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>He seemed excited, but also sad,</p>
      <p>and I think he was acting so odd because he realized he was forgetting everything.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Plus, I am certain he said pounds,</p>
      <p>not kilograms; mad in deed.</p>

      <p>Another time, at 6am or so, I was going through maps of south Pacific,</p>
      <p>in Ann Arbor, by that strange black metal cube sculpture that squeaks when rotated.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>I just had to get away from Ambrosia's morning clientele,</p>
      <p>bless their hearts.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>And I've noticed that across the park some student was sleeping under an evergreen,</p>
      <p>I don't think she worked in US, I just somehow assumed South America, Amazon.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>She stared getting off the ground, and tried to yell that she wasn't homeless or drunk,</p>
      <p>I kept looking into my maps, ignoring her; and she went on her way to get a grant, or give a speech or something.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>I am sure she worked in South America,</p>
      <p>probably with the natives.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Over in Ludington, there was this one time a little girl was feeding Seagulls with her mom,</p>
      <p>and just as I noticed the commotion...</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>one of the Seagulls,</p>
      <p>went, all, out!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Right in her hair,</p>
      <p>I felt so bad, and her mother was only barely able to contain her laughter.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>She puffed up her face as if playing a trumpet,</p>
      <p>you could totally tell she had enough of that kid, and she was getting payback for all her hissy fits.</p>

      <p>And then there is this... story that is most Dearest to me,</p>
      <p>one of my happiest memories, that I swore I would never talk about because I am far too mature.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Alas, this is what All Hallows' Eve is all about,</p>
      <p>talking about strange creatures, and wonderful memories.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>It was an beautiful early morning,</p>
      <p>I was sitting by my breakfast fire.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Mostly listening to birds, and probably angry bears,</p>
      <p>whilst squiggling in my journal, about poems, and programs.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>This was a large and beautiful camp site full of tress,</p>
      <p>they had clean showers, and proper restrooms.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>I had the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/hEuvinvxzRRPLj7y7">first camp site on the Orchid Loop</a>,</p>
      <p>and I noticed that a couple of giggly middle aged ladies were <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/qR39FpAkVJ5azPZQ6">just getting into the spirit of camping</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>They were always happy, and sophisticated,</p>
      <p>and laughing, playing some smart radio station, and always full of joy.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>This morning the tall one started shimmy shammying first,</p>
      <p>she was probably getting around to starting up a fire to make breakfast.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>They had all the firewood,</p>
      <p>and swe was singing something, it was unusual for people to make so many happy little noises during a stay there.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>She quieted down a bit,</p>
      <p>and lit her fire.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>And as she bent over to pick up some twigs to get things going,</p>
      <p>she fired off that old familiar sound that one would expect from a constipated and uncultured, filthy, lactose intolerant old man.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>And, oh my gosh,</p>
      <p>all of a sudden all the birds went quiet.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>It was just this unusual deafening silence,</p>
      <p>and that's just half the story, because all of a sudden this sophisticated wealthy woman goes:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>"Puull my finga"</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>In the worst fake southern accent she could possibly conjure up,</p>
      <p>and with the longest drawl.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>And then she quickly skedaddled back to her camper,</p>
      <p>- probably to change, and lay down a bit.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>This must have been ten years ago or more,</p>
      <p>and I still haven't forgotten about it.</p>
