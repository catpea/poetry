      <p>It took a little bit,</p>
      <p>for the thought to completely transmit.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The thermometer it my car,</p>
      <p>read 70, and I muttered, "how bizarre".</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I stuck my head out,</p>
      <p>to cast aside doubt.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And yes, Spring is here,</p>
      <p>let us cheer!</p>
    </div>

      <p>Nine days early,</p>
      <p>but it is here, surely.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It almost seems to soon,</p>
      <p>but this is the same weather we had last June.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>My bicycle was barely ready,</p>
      <p>but I jumped on it and rode forward sure and steady.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The on board computer fell apart,</p>
      <p>I gave it new batteries and pressed restart.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I noted ducks zooming through the air,</p>
      <p>cheerful and happy, and it was a pair.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Swoosh ans swish they flapped their wings,</p>
      <p>flying in a hurry to take care of all their things.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I set off to just do just ten miles today,</p>
      <p>just to make a little bit of headway.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I neither huffed nor puffed like some waking bear,</p>
      <p>as my dancing, kept me in good repair.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>There were couple of times, to be fair,</p>
      <p>where I too felt, like I was zooming thorough the air.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The wind was strong,</p>
      <p>but on my way back it actually pushed me along.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>There were three other bicyclists out there,</p>
      <p>but they were all still dressed for a winter afar.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I wore my t-shirt but kept out of shade,</p>
      <p>for there was till some chill left, I am afraid.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I returned with ten million poem ideas on my mind,</p>
      <p>but this was the only one where the words aligned.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And as I cheerfully made my way to the final line,</p>
      <p>I was ready for sleep and dreams of more sunshine.</p>
    </div>
