      <p>Drums will come in two varieties,</p>
      <p>synthesized, and as a recording of a real drum.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I think the rule of thumb is,</p>
      <p>the less computer like a drum is the better.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Here is an example of a synthetic kick drum,</p>
      <p>followed by a recording of one.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>There are enough filters and knobs in computer world,</p>
      <p>to make a synthetic drum sound real, and vice versa.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But musicians care about the history of their instruments,</p>
      <p>even though things may sound the same, it is better to do it right.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I once saw a music producer take some drum recordings into a tunnel,</p>
      <p>re-record them with the echo of a tunnel and call it his own version.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I think that is the correct way to approach instruments,</p>
      <p>customize, make your own, or just go out into a construct site and smash some things.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Take care of your drums, make a little audio or video tutorial about how they came into being,</p>
      <p>people who will enjoy your music will appreciate the story behind it.</p>

      <p>There are four types of drums that stick out in modern music,</p>
      <p>a kick, a bass drum, a snare, and a tom.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Here is what a kick sounds like,</p>
      <p>that is the drum we used before.</p>
      <p>* KICKER *</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Here is a bass drum,</p>
      <p>note that it is a little sharper.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>This is a snare drum,</p>
      <p>* SNARE *</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>and here is a tom,</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Drums most often play a melody so simple,</p>
      <p>that it is not even called a melody, but referred to as a pattern.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The most common drum pattern is called four-on-the-floor,</p>
      <p>and that is playing a drum on every beat in a song.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The four-on-the-floor has an extra feature that can be applied to it,</p>
      <p>it is called the backbeat, it is an additional drum that plays every other beat.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Here is an example showing the power of the backbeat,</p>
      <p>in the first half you will hear four on the floor alone which will sound a little boring.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>In the second half, I add the backbeat (an additional drum every other beat),</p>
      <p>and the simple beat becomes more sophisticated and more pleasant to the ear</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>To create something more complex,</p>
      <p>we mix drums together, and add additions features like clapping of hands.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>A musician playing drums will often sit at a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_kit">drum kit</a>,</p>
      <p>and a drum kit includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hi-hat">hi-hats</a>, which is a kind of cymbal.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Here is the sound that hats make,</p>
