      <p>That is all you get to save the world with,</p>
      <p>if it was easy somebody else would have done it already.</p>

      <p>Next time you're in class, look at the back row,</p>
      <p>one of them is a genius who does not believe in the world anymore, the rest need help, the sooner the better.</p>

      <p>I know you can prevent them from fracturing,</p>
      <p>I know you have it in you to save the world.</p>

    <section>
      <p>All around the world, liars stretch accepted patterns they hardly understand, like a bubble gum, and with perfect deniability,</p>
      <p>there is no blame, there is no proof, there are no laws that could help here, nothing can be done to fix anything.</p>

      <p>The state of things as we see today,</p>

    <section>
      <p>With real politics and wise politicians, we will see Universal Basic Income come into reality,</p>
      <p>and nobody is going to rob anything if they already have the money and live a life of Knowledge, Authenticity, and Dignity.</p>

      <p>that guides people towards Knowledge, Wisdom and Greatness, is where Humanity will find its future.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Once liars take to power, we can only wait for them to retire,</p>
      <p>and while we are waiting we have to help children grow so that they will become the Great Beings that will may their place.</p>
