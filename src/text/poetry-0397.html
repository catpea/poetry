      <p>It is probably possible to comprehend how the world works,</p>
      <p>and sort the causes from effects, and build a tree.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Imagine you are from Mars,</p>
      <p>and you just got here.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And there are problems,</p>
      <p>Human Rights Violations, Corruption, and the concept of money got completely messed up.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>This is probably easier than building the tree of life,</p>
      <p>it won't take a century, it will take a decade and a half.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Test your theory,</p>
      <p>make sure the results are reproducible.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And invite your friends for sweet black tea,</p>
      <p>build a small think tank, and a large charity, and try to fix it all.</p>

      <p>You won't be able to fight the bullies,</p>
      <p>but not because they are untouchable, but because the act of fighting spawns more bullies.</p>

      <p>One of the industries you will be studying,</p>
      <p>will without a doubt show you how that works.</p>

      <p>A wise being can't engage the evil,</p>
      <p>but she can prevent it from existing, and what a power *that* is.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>One of the greatest pillars of prevention that you can drive into time,</p>
      <p>is access to narrated books written by great beings.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And the greatest idea you can share,</p>
      <p>is that we are each meant to become a great being, by means of knowledge and wisdom.</p>
    </div>

      <p>Imagine what a massive intellectual strength that represents,</p>

      <p>As Humanity grows must all aim towards World Peace,</p>
      <p>and part of that is preventing wars from occurring.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>When the war begins, and the soldiers are sent in,</p>
      <p>it is our fault, our failure as One Human Family to create real schools and provide real education.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqra3BcqWM">Don't get mad as soldiers</a>,</p>
      <p>they have no choice.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is our failure that wars happen,</p>
      <p>and our power, the power of prevention, is greater than all the armed forces put together.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>War is an effect, a symptom,</p>
      <p>and the root cause is our failure to prevent it from happening.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The internet connects the world in part to erase the borders,</p>
      <p>for us to learn that we are family.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Fragile and failed states have great difficulty preventing information from crossing the border,</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_nx8L7pqEo">all it takes is a balloon</a> or a book, or poetry.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But in order for prevention to become an active force,</p>
      <p>we can't allow ourselves to live under the control of fear rooted in poverty be it of wallet, or of mind.</p>

      <p>Until the world is at peace,</p>
      <p>you can't have a career that does little to contribute to that aim.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Sitting in front of commuter monitors, pushing virtual buttons,</p>
      <p>waiting for that carrot and stick of a raise to tell you how great you are, does no one any good.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Neither poverty of wallet of mind, nor the broken concepts of money,</p>
      <p>should serve as a nose around our neck.</p>

      <p>But you went in the wrong direction,</p>
      <p>your Legacy has to in some part contribute to pushing away from war, and towards World Peace.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The direction you were meant to move,</p>
      <p>was up, not forward.</p>

      <p>It is hard for all of us,</p>
      <p>but that just means we need to become tougher, wiser, more intelligent, read more, listen to more narrated books, ask more, and spend some more time with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPSvdKTEZug">Great Beings</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Conquering something that is hard,</p>

      <p>Besides, you won't find financial security in sectors where you can be replaced by multiple younger people,</p>
      <p>that will never speak back, and can be replaced with even less effort if they cause trouble.</p>

      <p>Profit maximization,</p>

      <p>You won't be allowed to make enough money, to satisfy you,</p>
      <p>because that figure, will represent multiple employees that will do your job cheaper and faster, and as bonus, your boss will get, a bonus.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoqgAy3h4OM">Running your own company is the only financial security you will find</a>,</p>
      <p>plus you will get to look after your senior employees, and make sure that they make enough to satisfy them.</p>

      <p>You'll find your self in need of understanding how the world works,</p>

      <p>Honest wars become justified because of the evil that begins occurring in the streets,</p>
      <p>because someone has to step in there and put an end to human right violations.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The human rights violations must be prevented from occurring,</p>
      <p>and that will prevent the conflict from developing.</p>

      <p>Prevention is all we got,</p>

      <p>Ask yourself about your Knowledge, Wisdom, Content of Character, and Legacy,</p>
      <p>ask your elder self about their regrets, and consider how lasting your contributions to Human Kind.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>That's the manual you wished you had,</p>
      <p>that is the answer to where to go next, to "then what", and; a considerable portion of the answer, to the question of the meaning of your life.</p>
