    <div class="section">
      <p>There is something amazing,</p>
      <p>that you might not have never noticed about melodies.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Imagine a group of people singing Happy Birthday,</p>
      <p>and now a world away... imagine a young pianist learning her first notes by playing Happy Birthday.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And now, get this,</p>
      <p>they are both playing the Happy Birthday melody.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>In one instance voice is used,</p>
      <p>in the other, a piano.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>See a melody like Happy Birthday was not composed on a classical musical instrument,</p>
      <p>the lyrics were not added after the melody was made, the melody was made with the lyrics.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Singing turns us into musical instruments,</p>
      <p>just imagine an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2snTkaD64U" title="L'amour est un oiseau rebelle by Elina Garanca">opera singer</a> or a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAfPKNSvesI" title="The Owl and the Pussycat från Stockholms Universitetskörs (Stockholm University Choir)">church choir</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>A melody can be made out of words,</p>
      <p>or a piano, or a violin, on an electric guitar, or a mix thereof.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    <div class="section">
      <p>Musical rules are mean to be broken,</p>
      <p>the best artists pretty much aim for it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But that is something you do on your own in your musical career,</p>
      <p>but to get there you must first adopt a few rules as your favorite, as your initial style.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>So let us make a simple melody, in modern times a program like lmms can show you which keys belong to what scale,</p>
      <p>and then even automatically convert your notes to chords, so knowledge of music theory in not a requirement, at all.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Rather than showing you how to create things in sequence,</p>
      <p>which would be chords bass and melody, a task best left for a second tutorial.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I will show you how things sound when they stand alone,</p>
      <p>how vulnerable things are until they come together.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I will do this as proof, that if you have ever made a melody before,</p>
      <p>by drumming, or whistling, or creating your own words to a little song, you made a melody.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It was a perfect and beautiful melody,</p>
      <p>but it was missing, the chords, and bass.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>If you had all those things aligned together,</p>
      <p>then you would have a beautiful work of art on your hands.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Before we begin, I will say that a song needs a soul,</p>
      <p>lots of background sounds, that click together, but you can't quite hear where something starts and something ends.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is just the center, or the background of a song,</p>
      <p>these are called chords, multiple keys pressed together.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>A chord is simply a complex and good sounding sound,</p>
      <p>made by pressing few piano keys together, at the same time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>From time to time a chord can use some bass,</p>
      <p>bass are the deep sounding notes, they aren't always audible, very often you can't hear them at all on cheap speakers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Bass fills in whatever chords missed,</p>
      <p>Together bass and chords, create a universe of sound.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Your melody must be born of that universe,</p>
      <p>related to chords, but dominating the sound of the world, as if the melody was the sun.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Your melody, must not leave that world without great preparations,</p>
      <p>if you take just the melody part, it won't last on its own.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Now let me show you what a melody outside of her universe sounds like,</p>
      <p>and let me warn you, that it won't sound perfect,</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>There are connectors here that fit the chords,</p>
      <p>but there are no chords, yet.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Now, before we get to the chords, the most complex sounding part of this melody,</p>
      <p>let me show you what the bass sounds like.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The bass is the proto-chord, it was once the original set of notes that sparked the melody,</p>
      <p>but now, it lives beneath everything, it serves as the ground for both chords and melody.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Here, is what it sounds like, and again I must warn you that it is very dark,</p>
      <p>it is very, scary (and hard to hear on cheap speakers).</p>
    </div>

    </div>

    <div class="section">

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And here we arrive at the chords, the oxygen, the lovely cumulonimbus,</p>
      <p>but also the wind, and maybe the occasional gust as well.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Note how complete the chords are, there is nothing missing here,</p>
      <p>the chords do not call for bass, nor are they in any way hurting when the melody is not playing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>That means you can have a section of just the cords,</p>
      <p>perhaps with the bass to be consistent, but you do not need the melody to be playing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>This gives you the ability to let the listener rest from the for a bit,</p>
      <p>before you put it back in, and if you dare, and I hope you never do, you could have a stretch with just the bass, what audacity!</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Now time has come to assemble our song,</p>
      <p>let us see what bass and chords sound like without the melody.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Whoo Wee, well that certainly doesn't sound like all hat no cows,</p>
      <p>it sounds nice like a moonlit search for wisdom.</p>
    </div>

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And now finally, let us add the high pitched melody,</p>
      <p>let us place it in the world that it belongs in.</p>
