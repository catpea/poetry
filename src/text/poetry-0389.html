      <p>Schools and Tests are so tightly connected,</p>
      <p>that it is not possible to fix schools without collapsing tests.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Tests and professional careers are so tightly nit,</p>
      <p>that it may actually be more difficult to get a job with a real education.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But, real education is so critical to our development,</p>
      <p>that it must override all other concerns.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>If a career calls for a decade of fake education,</p>
      <p>then it is not a healthy career.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Passing the useless tests requires matching knowledge,</p>
      <p>that knowledge will be disconnected and low quality.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We need real knowledge,</p>
      <p>as it will make us stronger, more creative, and wiser.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Until schools provide real and positive results,</p>
      <p>they cannot be treated seriously.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Real knowledge is too important,</p>
      <p>to partake in educational fairy tales.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Above all, real knowledge is about reality,</p>
      <p>every scientific institution and society immediately become a friend.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Second of all, the entire world is suffering from poverty,</p>
      <p>real education leads students to become independent entrepreneurs.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And overall, real education helps students grow up in reality,</p>
      <p>and take note of all the worlds problems.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Such as climate change, pollution, mass incarceration,</p>
      <p>corruption, exploitation, and war.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The world belongs to the younger generations,</p>
      <p>their brightest hopes are our most important orders.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>No student wishes to witness,</p>
      <p>ecosystem collapse or mass extinction.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>They do not wish for prisons where there should be schools,</p>
      <p>or under the table deals by men who are about to be forgotten by history.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>They do not wish to see one nation taking advantage, or letting down another,</p>
      <p>and certainly no one wishes for nations to misguide their children into unavoidable wars.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Concepts like the college entrance exams, or grades,</p>
      <p>or career choice and retirement plans, are just not important when compared to real problems.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Providing real education to the younger generation is our duty as Human Beings,</p>
      <p>and there is no time to sit around and talk about slight improvements to what has been broken for a century.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Results are needed now,</p>
      <p>especially where poverty, climate change, and the unforeseen (such as pandemics) are concerned.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Organized education had a chance to correct their ways,</p>
      <p>and instead they invented standardized testing to oil their machinery further.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>A change is required now,</p>
      <p>a change made possible by the internet, and smart-phones, and the world encyclopedia.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>What would take one person a lifetime to build,</p>
      <p>will take thousands of volunteers a short time, in deed.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We have seen great advancements,</p>
      <p>in the way complex subjects can be introduced.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We need to learn from science popularizes like Carl Sagan and</p>
      <p>and all the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw">amazing</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ws6qmXDJgwU">inspired</a> educators that hope to teach for real.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We have to create an Open Uncensored World Curriculum,</p>
      <p>that will help the younger generations learn from Middle School on, to no end.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>There should be as many paths through it as students,</p>
      <p>everyone is interested in different things, in a different sequence, and at a different pace.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>There will be no grades, just areas of interest and contribution where the like-minded can build open communities,</p>
      <p>where community reviewed employers can search for talent.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Schools had a chance to lead, and now they will have to follow,</p>
      <p>all the lectures and presentations will be available under Public Domain.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The issues that fake education contributed to,</p>
      <p>and real education can easily fix are far too many, and far too miserable to mention.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Not to mention the ridiculousness and the child like thinking required to concoct the fantasy of</p>
      <p>Lecture, Test, GPA, Entrance Exam, and Career.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The betrayal of students, must end now,</p>
      <p>no one is to be tricked into thinking that they are unintelligent to remove them out of the way.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And no one is to be stressed into an unhealthy or unbalanced life, or poverty,</p>
      <p>because they can't handle the unforgivable debt, the mindless memorization, and endless broken promises and lies.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    <div class="section">
      <p>If you can, help the world build the new curriculum by both participating in its development,</p>
      <p>and laying down your own educational path so that others may follow the curriculum you leave behind.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We are each an extremely intelligent being,</p>
      <p>and when our intelligence is fueled by real, functional, integrated knowledge, long enough; it will ignite into a great wisdom.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Learn, learn at your own pace, in the sequence that satisfies your curiosities best,</p>
      <p>learn to no end; and when you are ready, become an Entrepreneur and set your self free from unforgivable debt and poverty.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Until real schools exist,</p>
      <p>you must accept the responsibility for your own education.</p>
