      <p>Anything that can go wrong may go wrong,</p>
      <p>and there is only one guarantee in life.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>It is a guarantee, precisely because it is within our complete control,</p>
      <p>the guarantee is The Greatness Of Our Soul, or Spirit, or Being.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>It means you will keep getting up no matter how many times you fall,</p>
      <p>it means you will continue moving forward without stopping.</p>

      <p>It means there is no pain, it means there is no weakness,</p>
      <p>that it is a function and fact of life that we advance forward.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>And on the day of triumph,</p>
      <p>it means that the prize is nothing less than Laughter and Joy of Life.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>The Greatness of Our Soul, our single guarantee in life,</p>
      <p>may begin in discomfort, but it concludes with something <strong>far</strong> more.</p>

      <p>Marvels of the Human Spirit that we can't directly conjure up within ourselves,</p>
      <p>marvels that can only come out of our Might and Authenticity.</p>

      <p>Humor and Foolishness, Cheerfulness and Bliss,</p>
      <p>Sweetens and Giggles, Joy, Laughter, Wisdom and Delight.</p>
