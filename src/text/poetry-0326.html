      <p>Everything we touch must advance forward,</p>
      <p>it is just how life works.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is not a bad thing,</p>
      <p>it is not a difficult thing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is a reward for being alive,</p>
      <p>a reward for being awake.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>This does not mean that we jog,</p>
      <p>extra ten miles a day, no, no, no.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It means that we identify what stopped us yesterday,</p>
      <p>and understand it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And rise above it,</p>
      <p>in dignity and strength.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Everything that surrounds us,</p>
      <p>wants to burst out in colors.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But if all we do is stop,</p>
      <p>and never try..</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Then all we get,</p>
      <p>is what we see.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Songs are a good example of that,</p>
      <p>they are full of color, patters, and energy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You just need to slow down,</p>
      <p>to hear what they are made out of.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And see how they are just fast enough,</p>
      <p>to bring you joy, but not the building plans beneath.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The structure of the colors bursting out of the song,</p>
      <p>is for you to study, day by day.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Until you can hear the kicks, claps, hats, ambiance, melody and bass,</p>
      <p>and take it apart, and make a note of all the pieces.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And stop, stop, listening to other people's song,</p>
      <p>and begin making your own songs that others may listen to.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    <div class="section">
      <p>All the intricate details of all the wonders around us,</p>
      <p>they are right before you.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The teachers won't help you understand any of it,</p>
      <p>it is you who must reach out, pencil in hand.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is the same for everything,</p>
      <p>from quantum physics, to dance songs, abstract art and oil painting.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>All the answers to all the mysteries are right before you,</p>
      <p>all you have to do is patiently reach out.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>This is one of the biggest gifts of life,</p>
      <p>understanding the beauty around us, and maybe creating some more.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We won't understand everything all at once, only one precious step at a time,</p>
      <p>and that is both what it takes to start, and what it takes to get to the finish line.</p>
