      <p>Hey,</p>
      <p>Teacher.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>A lot of the students somehow know...</p>
      <p>- and they are watching you.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>They are learning from you,</p>
      <p>what not to become.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Most teachers will copy other teacher's grades,</p>
      <p>even when classes are not related.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>To them a C student,</p>
      <p>is a C student in their class too.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>So a C in English,</p>
      <p>will make a C student in Spanish, maybe in Math, and probably in Art too.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>This is called "I hate my job",</p>
      <p>this is called incompetence.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Teaching is not a job, painting is a job, maintenance is a job,</p>
      <p>teaching is about propagation of the best of culture.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>To fail to teach,</p>
      <p>is to fail an entire generation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>To fail a generation,</p>
      <p>is to have them repeat mistakes, and force them to make new ones.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>A failed culture is a cult,</p>
      <p>it is a temporary thing swiftly moving towards the brick wall of reality.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It won't just be about torture like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LPubUCJv58">enhanced-interrogation</a>,</p>
      <p>or concentration camps like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Jq-V4qvZh8">cramped government-detention facilities that separate children from mothers</a>,</p>
      <p>and it won't stop at what has been called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7RojQpJWMw">vocational facilities</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>To fail a generation,</p>
      <p>is to restart them at zero, and have them repeat every horrible mistake.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Teaching is not a job,</p>
      <p>is all we have.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Teaching is all we have.</p>

      <p>Schools that use grades,</p>
      <p>cause harm.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Teachers that blindly follow the broken practice,</p>
      <p>misunderstood the meaning of education.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Children with bad grades,</p>
      <p>will use them as a measure of self.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxyKNMrhEvY">Curriculum based education causes harm</a>,</p>
      <p>teachers often scare their students into memorization, which is meaningless and temporary.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Maybe not completely meaningless,</p>
      <p>because by a very long extension that the teachers themselves won't grasp in their shallow thinking and ignorance, the teachers cause great harm.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>They set the students up,</p>
      <p>for complete failure.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>A good programmer kid,</p>
      <p>will not get an A in programming when they are flunking math.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And they will be flunking Math, because unlike Programming which is a rational chain of functions,</p>
      <p>math teachers in their sick incompetence will frighten their students into brainless memorization.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Programming is a superset of math, think of programming as a thing that wraps math,</p>
      <p><a href="https://github.com/catpea/math-as-code">school math is tiny compared to software</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Bad teachers have no grasp on fundamentals, and in some cases reality even,</p>
      <p>they only know enough to bring a paycheck home, and sadly, that is more than enough to destroy minds.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>There is no argument to save the face of bad teachers,</p>
      <p>because of the harm their misunderstanding, has caused - they are the men that sold the world.</p>

      <p>Homeschooling will only make things worse,</p>
      <p>it will cut students off from modern culture.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Homeschooling is likely to make students more susceptible to lies and manipulations,</p>
      <p>and their eventual start in life will be worse for it.</p>

      <p>An education,</p>
      <p>is not supposed to be something that starts when a student goes to school.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>That kind of education,</p>
      <p>is the least and the worst.</p>

      <p>What a child, or student needs,</p>
