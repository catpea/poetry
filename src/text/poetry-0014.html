      <p>A truly brave man is ever serene; he is never taken by surprise; nothing ruffles the equanimity of his spirit.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>In the heat of battle he remains cool; in the midst of catastrophes he keeps level his mind.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Earthquakes do not shake him, he laughs at storms.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>We admire him as truly great, who, in the menacing presence of danger or death, retains his self-possession; who, for instance, can compose a poem under impending peril or hum a strain in the face of death.</p>
