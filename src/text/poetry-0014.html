      <p>Quarantine Day Ten.</p>
      <p>My arms grew so powerful from all the rest that I mistakenly struck myself several times.</p>
      <p>I busied myself today relearning how to handle all my amazing strength.</p>
      <p>Renamed Hash Bang to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)">Shebang</a>, as it is the most commonly used variant.</p>

      <p>Begun working on a beat sequencer, and a song maker.</p>
      <p>The idea here is that Chords, Bass, Melodies can all be handled by the <a href="https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js/wiki/Arpeggiator">Arpeggiator</a>, but the beat is a bit more complex, and needs a little tool.</p>
      <p>The tool I have up today uses re-styled checkboxes, a perfect fit for the sequencer.</p>
