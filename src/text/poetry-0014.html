      <p>A truly brave man is ever serene; he is never taken by surprise; nothing ruffles the equanimity of his spirit.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>In the heat of battle he remains cool; in the midst of catastrophes he keeps level his mind.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Earthquakes do not shake him, he laughs at storms.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>We admire him as truly great, who, in the menacing presence of danger or death, retains his self-possession; who, for instance, can compose a poem under impending peril or hum a strain in the face of death.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Such indulgence betraying no tremor in the writing or in the voice, is taken as an infallible index of a large nature&#x2014;of what we call a capacious mind, which, far from being pressed or crowded, has always room for something more.</p>
