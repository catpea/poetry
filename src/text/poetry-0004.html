      <p>May our philosophy be filled with power and may we connect in authenticity.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>May we help each other to maintain Honor untarnished and unsullied and to show forth in our lives the ideals we learned in doing our duty.</p>

      <p>All of which we ask in the names of those before us, of those who stand today, and those who are yet to rise.</p>
