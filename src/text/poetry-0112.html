      <p>Since we can't see future clearly,</p>
      <p>the risk is simply too great not to take the higher more challenging roads.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>If we are mistaken about the importance of growing up,</p>
      <p>and choose to push, and climb, and become Great Beings, anyway.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Well, we can hardly say that we have fooled ourselves,</p>
      <p>Becoming a Brilliant and Beautiful Being, is probably pretty hard to regret.</p>

    <section>
      <p>But if we are mistaken about the importance of growing up,</p>
      <p>and put opinion above fact, fantasy over reality, merely age and never grow.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>If we reject real education for grades, and GPA, and a photo op,</p>
      <p>and a mere feeling of maturity, but also, fear and no motivation to continue.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>If we reach the age of retirement,</p>
      <p>confused, or breakable, and lost.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Then we will regret this,</p>
      <p>surely.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And although we won't know what might have been, we will have a feeling,</p>
      <p>that Growing Up would have brought us clarity, unbreakability, and calm.</p>

    <section>
      <p>The risk of misunderstanding the importance of Growing Up,</p>
      <p>is too great, let us all aim to become Great Beings, My Friends.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The Beauty of Beginnings,</p>
      <p>it that they are always simple.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>There are very few unfamiliar things that play a role in rising,</p>
      <p>after all, we only rise to become More Human, All Too Human.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>We are born with this ability,</p>
      <p>it <em>has to be</em> within each and every one of us.</p>

      <p>It starts in childhood, as we venture to explore,</p>
      <p>be it a garden, or some rusty machinery, or the alien worlds beyond the train tracks.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And like interesting pebbles in a pocket, our observations add,</p>
      <p>and as a whole stand to mean more.</p>

      <p>Once our mind begins to flourish a decade later,</p>
      <p>what we found of interest, or the things that created more questions, lead us to books.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>We discover that there were others there walking that path before us,</p>
      <p>and what once was a twinkling star, becomes a Distant Sun, not unlike our Sun.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And where once darkness was,</p>
      <p>there is now a ray of light.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And we must stay on this path, My Friends,</p>
      <p>everyone will try to push you, claim to know better.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Siblings, Parents, Teachers, Friends, your Boss,</p>
      <p>they will have few motives, and little to explain.</p>

    <section>
      <p>If you resist, or rise again, and find your way forward,</p>
      <p>the Universe will continue adding to your Knowledge.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>You will slowly begin to become;</p>
      <p>less what others need - and more of who you really are.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Your knowledge will begin overflowing,</p>
      <p>it will create a vast ocean.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And then the waves will finally come,</p>
      <p>churn, turn, tickle; help you up, and rest and relax, and feel safe.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And that is the first plateau, the first step towards Your Greatness,</p>
      <p>the finding of calm, and the successful resistance of what others want you to be.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The waves will carry you,</p>
      <p>but the ocean you swim in is your knowledge, is perfectly familiar, and friendly.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And just reach out,</p>
      <p>to what you will love next.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And touch and remember,</p>
      <p>and let the next plateau emerge.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <hr>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Your plateaus, their order, and height and color, are not just a path to Greatness,</p>
      <p>they are also your Beauty.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Anybody can know what you know,</p>
      <p>but only you will build your road to Greatness in that particular sequence and style.</p>

    <section>
      <p>You may start with Mountainous Adventure, add Celestial Cartography,</p>
      <p>followed by a venture into your own Photography Business.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>These are the waves of your own personal private school of life,</p>
      <p>your ever expanding ocean, your Thriving Living Body of Knowledge.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>There is no one single direction here,</p>
      <p>it is all directions all the time.</p>
    </section>

    </section>

    <section>
      <p>So as long as you resist being pushed to places that are alien to you,</p>
      <p>and carry on building Your Universe Within, you can only grow.</p>

    <section>

    </section>

    <section>
      <p>More than what to think,</p>
      <p>it is important to learn how to think.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>More than others pushing you around,</p>
      <p>you must let your own ocean move you.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>No one can enact an external force on you,</p>
      <p>that can ever be greater than the power that is already within you.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Nothing external, or yet unfamiliar to you,</p>
      <p>can move you as much as that which you Cherish, Admire and Love.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Grow in the Sequence that Makes You a Force of Nature,</p>
      <p>and at the familiar pace that your ocean expands at.</p>
    </section>

    </section>

    <section>
      <p>To become a Great Being, to Grow All The Way Up,</p>
      <p>is to become Perfectly Unbreakable out of all the Uncompressible treasure within you.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Do not be sacred, for that which is in your power, becomes your power,</p>
      <p>and that which is not - is not your fault.</p>
