      <p>Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Twenty Five,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Yesterday, Bernie dropped out.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I didn't even try to wait, you can't place this much weight.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And what were we expecting?</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>It has always been like this, hit and miss.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>It is time for all, to rise.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Become a Citizen of The World. In your own hands.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>With your own mind. Seek Knowledge and Triumph.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Let the name of this New Nation be, Earth,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>May the Citizen be called, a Human.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The power is in your hands, so near,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>rooted in every audio-book you can hear.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And you have to lean to rise,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>you can't near the skies,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>without your eyes!</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>When you have learned enough, you have to turn around and teach.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Yell from your mountain, scream, dance and preach.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The promise of Freedom, Reason, and Peace,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>is in our hands, it is our Masterpiece.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Education is <a href="http://catpea.com/warrior">fun</a> it only ever seems hard,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>because one is trying to learn too much in too little time.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The only way we can fully learn,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>is by inheriting knowledge from World's most beloved Heroes.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>This inheritance begins by following in their footstep, first;</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>and continues, when we break away to resume where they left off.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Rise, rise to the mountains before you.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The only way,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>is to go up,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>to grow up,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>to grow all the way up,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>until we each become a Great Being.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Same as those before us,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>same as those that are sure to rise.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Open Your Eyes.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The Time is Always Now.</p>
