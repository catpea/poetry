      <p>Real Education will help you stay two, three or more steps ahead of all the complex trouble we can't foresee,</p>
      <p>it will help you counter all the moves against you before they are even made, it will keep you safe.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But it is not just about your safety, but also about your strength, intelligence,</p>
      <p>your class, the way you move through life, and the way you change the world.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And it is not just about you, it is about all people choosing real education,</p>
      <p>it is about Humanity growing up, moving beyond all the tragic mistakes it is making.</p>

      <p>Do you understand how important you are, without you the world is unable to progress forward,</p>
      <p>when the liars have masses they can manipulate, they gain the power to hold the world back.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is true that superhero stories are just a projection of what we are capable of,</p>
      <p>but the same goes for the dark side, they will sway the uneducated to get them to vote on laws that hurt the world.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Voters are only as capable as the culture they grow up in, that is why free speech and freedom of thought is important,</p>
      <p>it sets those who are about to corner themselves free to grow and flourish.</p>

      <p>All that can be said about where you need to learn from, is that we will fight to keep libraries open,</p>
      <p>and we will separate fantasy from reality, and all the life changing are available for free in a narrated format.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You don't have to go to the library, but you must find your way to books, to narrated books, to biographies, and storytellers,</p>
      <p>lives lived for real, wisdom won in great battles, and the defeat of great manipulators, dictators, and liars.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>School can only teach you to memorize, that is only good for numbers and letters, and can't translate well beyond the basics,</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxyKNMrhEvY">you need to learn when you are ready to learn</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwIyy1Fi-4Q">learn at your own pace</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKS_HhdSJ_4">and in a sequence that fits what you already know</a>.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Find your first thousand books, be safe, become wise,</p>
      <p>and grow to become, a Great Being, and change the world.</p>
