      <p>All nations try very hard to divide,</p>
      <p>outline their treasure and their national pride.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>But reality is such,</p>
      <p>that this does not matter much.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>One can complain about this nation or that nation,</p>
      <p>but that does not change the situation...</p>

      <p>We are one,</p>
      <p>one family under the sun.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Eventually Education, Foresight, Wisdom, and World Peace,</p>
      <p>will bring us all together and the complaints will cease.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Until then, we must each remember that borders are useless,</p>
      <p>they only divide and create a huge mess.</p>

      <p>A border does not mark its people to be of any particular kind,</p>
      <p>it only keeps different kinds of colorful groups apart.</p>

      <p>It is not correct to be unhappy about a nation,</p>
      <p>let us be unhappy about lack of safety, books and education.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Let us come together and stand against lack of Good Schools and Wisdom,</p>
      <p>let us but complain about divisions and lack of peace and calm.</p>

      <p>If there were no borders, there would be more friendship and love,</p>
      <p>all nations United in Peace under the symbol of the white dove.</p>

      <p>We are not different from one another,</p>
      <p>a sister or brother from a different mother.</p>

      <p>In the World of the Future we won't be divided at all,</p>
      <p>people will forget why we needed a wall.</p>
