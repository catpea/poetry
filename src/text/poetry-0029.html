      <p>Captain's Log, Quarantine Serserge, Day Twenty Four,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I am ready to jump into my bed like a big dinosaur.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I am dressed, I am wearing my favorite workout clothes,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I stretched left and right, and fluffed up my pillows.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>For tonight, I prepared, a Bill Bryson Auidobook I adore,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Even though I am already so sleepy that I could snore.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I will listen about the <a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/A-Short-History-of-Nearly-Everything-Audiobook/B002V0KFPW">History of the World</a>,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>about all the mysterious things and places we explored.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>This is how I go to sleep every night,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>the book will slowly play... until daylight.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I learned so much from online lectures and audio books,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>that these days, I can focus on my good looks.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Oh, how I miss working out at the gym,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>but I am still working hard to be slim.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Let us all be of good cheer,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>quarantine will be over soon,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>that is clear.</p>
    </section>
