      <p>Disclaimer, this work of unchecked fancy is loosely inspired</p>
      <p>by Daniel Dennett's ideas on consciousness.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>"But as Descartes observed, even an infinitely powerful evil demon couldn't trick him into thinking he himself existed if he didn't exist:</p>
      <p>cogito ergo sum, â€œI think, therefore I am." -- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JP1nmExfgpg">Daniel Dennett</a></p>

      <p>I wrote 432 poems now,</p>
      <p>and I have no idea how.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is never something that I want to write about,</p>
      <p>like funny cats, new song and art ideas, or my workout.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And even though I start my poem by concentrating,</p>
      <p>it is as if, I always end up waiting.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And what _is_ this thing that I seem to end up wait for?</p>
      <p>as I sit and sit... staring at the boring floor.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Does the idea drive a little car?</p>
      <p>and does it make a little pit stop by some little bar?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Because, in my opinion the idea is _always_ late,</p>
      <p>why can't it just... accelerate?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And what happens when my little poems just keep going,</p>
      <p>is it a little boat that is rowing, or is it a wind that can't stop blowing?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Not to say that I am long winded surely,</p>
      <p>plus I always try to write very maturity.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But I admit, a twenty minute narration,</p>
      <p>is a little heavy on the duration.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Worse than that, the _whole_ audio book,</p>
      <p>is now measured in days a fact that I try to overlook.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>After almost half a thousand days,</p>
      <p>the ideas seem to move along their _own_ roads and waterways.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>As you can imagine, it gets rough when you get stuck,</p>
      <p>it is a little bit like chasing a duck.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I always thought poems were simple things,</p>
      <p>but that is not true as they have their own wings.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Even if it is a long and scientific text,</p>
      <p>you never know when you are going to end up next.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    <div class="section">
      <p>I guess it is just one of those things that meander,</p>
      <p>like some twitchy golden salamander.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>As all of a sudden you go from commander,</p>
      <p>to a mere bystander.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Standing in a corner holding a pen in one hand,</p>
      <p>and the other a piece of paper on which you doodled all the way to the end.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The words at the bottom are all squished,</p>
      <p>NO, you couldn't avoid scribbling them no matter how much you wished.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And then no matter how hard you try to squint,</p>
      <p>you can't read your own print.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The poem seems to end with the word jabberwock,</p>
      <p>underlined twice, as it was the punchline, but it doesn't rhyme.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And by now you forgot your final stanza,</p>
      <p>it is now gibberish and all kinds of extravaganza.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The idea drove away, the rhymes floated down the stream,</p>
      <p>the duck ate the salamander, turns out they weren't even a team.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But, before you know it I finish poem #433,</p>
      <p>which has yet again written it self as if I were some helpless manatee.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And I still don't know how poems can just write them themselves,</p>
      <p>though this one for a change at-least reads as it was written by elves.</p>
