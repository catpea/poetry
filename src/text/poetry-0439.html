    <div class="section">
      <p>Some are very excited about the idea that at the quantum level,</p>
      <p>things can travel back in time and are never quite guaranteed.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Others, love the fact that adaptive systems which accumulate-state between generations,</p>
      <p>given enough time... can easily create conscious life.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>As beautiful as those marvels are,</p>
      <p>there is something even more powerful and far wilder.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The quantum and emergence are simple things,</p>
      <p>that make what we should call, small leaps.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But there is a phenomenon that deals with such enormous leaps, and such, out of control consequence,</p>
      <p>that no hope of predictability, not even a shadow of control, remains.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>A process in the middle world,</p>
      <p>between the quarks and quasars.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is supremely random,</p>
      <p>often finding its beginning in the actual random walk of a human being, a creature already out of control. ...</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And as out of control as it is, it is not at all strange,</p>
      <p>it is no stranger, than going home and sitting down on one's favorite chair.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is not a process invented by nature, it is not emergent, there is nothing accidental here,</p>
      <p>the root of this thing has begun less than 200,000 years ago.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>On earth it was invented by humans,</p>
      <p>it required their deliberate attention, and agreement, a mark on a stick, a notch on a bone, a symbol in a cave, perhaps a precisely places shell, or a mound thereof.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It's beginning as are extremely humble,</p>
      <p>no doubt, the phenomenon emerged independently in multiple cultures.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It grew in complexity,</p>
      <p>just like the culture of the modern human.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It was human made,</p>
      <p>so it grew along with humans.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>All things considered,</p>
      <p>yeah, it is our greatest invention.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is so powerful, that it can snuff out entire kingdoms,</p>
      <p>as if they were a mere flame of a candle.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Dictators are scared of it,</p>
      <p>and they are unable to deal with those who take to it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The universe lost control,</p>
      <p>but so did the rulers, and the slavers, the priests and the liars.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The thing is a wild card,</p>
      <p>it comes in endless variety and each unique mind connects to it slightly differently, and it never stops craving for more.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>See an adaptive system, dumps what has been weakly accumulated by accident,</p>
      <p>but this thing, connects with us, bonds with us.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is not a cosmic bond, not a neuronal bond,</p>
      <p>but it bonds with the totality of our mind, it refines our mind and our very thoughts.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It weakens mistakes,</p>
      <p>and strengthens powers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>See the measly time travel that quantum particles maybe doing,</p>
      <p>does not compare.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>This thing can do time travel almost for real,</p>
      <p>and in the most magnificent of ways, and each time we connect with it, it becomes even more magnificent.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It deepens vision,</p>
      <p>it refines foresight.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is so powerful,</p>
      <p>that no one is able to describe it all, not in any coherent way.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And even if they did,</p>
      <p>the moment they finished, their description would be already out of date.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And it is not just a thing, or a phenomenon,</p>
      <p>it is more like a living revolution, a wave of ideas that rounds the globe, person by person.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is not a public phenomenon,</p>
      <p>that does not even approach to do it justice.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is a deeply person thing,</p>
      <p>a sacred thing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And hold it in your hand, and transfer it's contents into your mind through your imagination,</p>
      <p>it will feel like paper, but it becomes a unique universe in our unique mind.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I would never call this a book,</p>
      <p>nor would I ever try to describe it by saying how one reads it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>A book that is merely read,</p>
      <p>is a waste of time, it is worthless.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The real thing is something more,</p>
      <p>more than I can hope to describe.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>No reader who's loved their book,</p>
      <p>ever felt it in their hand.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And there is more,</p>
      <p>because it is not just what the book holds in its pages, but what _you_ bring _in_to_ it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The books you read and re-read change,</p>
      <p>as you grow.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Fundamentally, there is a feature of a book, that must be noted loud and clear,</p>
      <p>a well written book will help us inherit refined wisdom from across many lifetimes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>No one ever ever reads just one book,</p>
      <p>and no one inherits the precise medley of the things the author described.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Ergo, we each read from a different library,</p>
      <p>even though we may share the same books.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>If all there remains at the end of universe,</p>
      <p>is room for a simple singe word to describe what a book is.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>That word would be,</p>
      <p>upgrade.</p>
    </div>
