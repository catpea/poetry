      <p>Every new thing you learn,</p>
      <p>contributes something to how you think.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Thinking is not just about understanding,</p>
      <p>but also about idea synthesis and new inventions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is tough to define how this works,</p>
      <p>as it related to what a person already knows and how they think.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Something as small as pondering Henry Thoreau having a biscuit at this cabin,</p>
      <p>can open up a gushing ocean of ideas, it will certainly expand it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Henry lived by the northern point of the Appalachian Trail,</p>
      <p>maybe that fact can get you driving down to Georgia.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You could begin section hiking large swaths of the trail,</p>
      <p>journal, or audio recorder in hand.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You don't even need to read Walden,</p>
      <p>just know that it is important to lead, to become a legend.</p>

      <p>More than learning and becoming more creative,</p>
      <p>we should each hope to mark upcoming centuries with an inspirational legacy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Just because we can't live a few hundred years,</p>
      <p>does not mean our best ideas should end with us.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Your best ideas belong to the younger generations,</p>
      <p>so that they need not start at the level you started.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is not just about invention,</p>
      <p>but also about creating things that solve problems that people actually have.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We all to often avoid thinking about unanswerable questions,</p>
      <p>in deed we hold them up as such and extinguish conversations.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But there is no such thing as an unanswerable question,</p>
      <p>look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvm7dB0mOic">Seth Shostak</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>He makes a wonderful point when stating that aliens - creatures that we don't know exist,</p>
      <p>will have an appendage that will be able to hold a soldering iron, to build that first radio antenna.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Even though this wonderful thought is as nebulous as it gets,</p>
      <p>and belongs to a whole new level of unanswerable questions, it is a solid point.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVyeh690TGk">Richard Dawkins, answers another seemingly unanswerable question</a>,</p>
      <p>"<a href="https://youtu.be/WVyeh690TGk?t=5232">What if you are wrong?</a>".</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Many young people contemplate what they would hold as true,</p>
      <p>if they were born to a different family in a different country.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>An that makes them question the things that they have accepted as facts,</p>
      <p>to a young and rebellious mind, an unanswerable question is nonsense.</p>

      <p>The more we learn the more solution patterns we discover,</p>
      <p>by inheriting from other thinkers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The most powerful aspects of learning from beings like the ones I mention here,</p>
      <p>is applying what you learn from them, by subtle analogy to questions, that they themselves have never encountered.</p>

      <p>Henry left it all behind,</p>
      <p>he made room to think.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>What if, instead of facing _your_ next grand challenge, head on,</p>
      <p>you section hike or even through hike the Appalachian Trail, first.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You can easily imagine what a great mistake it will feel like on your first day,</p>
      <p>and what a great triumph it will become the day you reach <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WugC2K7gUA">Mount Katahdin</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It could feel like being reborn as a Great Being,</p>
      <p>or a tiny screaming baby.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But it will be a profound experience that will bring you enlightenment,</p>
      <p>and wisdom.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Often times <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPSvdKTEZug" title="Often times people learn that their challenge completely transformed, and so did they.">people learn that their challenge completely transformed</a>,</p>
      <p>and so did they.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And all it takes,</p>
      <p>is knowing that Henry, went to the woods.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Taking to Wisdom, Meaning, and Enlightenment,</p>
      <p>as part of life, as part of growing up, and part of facing challenges, is a powerful solution pattern.</p>

      <p>Richard Dawkins and Seth Shostak teach us that when something seems unanswerable,</p>
      <p>we need to build a new bridge, and access it from a different perspective.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Not just think outside the box or view it in a different light,</p>
      <p>as junior engineers are fond of doing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But, teleporting ourselves across worlds,</p>
      <p>watching the Milky Way from Andromeda, seeing Eath from Mars, or just seeing yourself in a different nation, culture, and family.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>There are no unanswerable questions,</p>
      <p>though there are plenty of silly ones that warrant no answer and can only waste precious time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxyKNMrhEvY">And the more we learn, the better we become at recognizing what learning is like</a>,</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And we have to begin learning and advancing forward,</p>
      <p>because the world is not meant to stand still.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>A civilization that does not advance,</p>
      <p>will stagnate in darkness and corruption, and confusion, and lies and manipulations and probably begin moving backwards as nations crumble.</p>

      <p>We are each meant for Greatness,</p>
      <p>every one of us.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The road to get there is simple,</p>
      <p>learn, become knowledgeable, become wise, and help the wold grow so that children don't have to start where you started, but at the height you reached.</p>
