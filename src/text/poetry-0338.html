    <div class="section">
      <p>Can you describe bass?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Bass is the low frequency sound,</p>
      <p>these are the growls and thumps in a song.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Back when cassette tape players were all the rage,</p>
      <p>some of them had a Bass Boost switch.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The end result was to give a song more oomph,</p>
      <p>the headphones would bring in some heavier punching sounds.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You have no doubt heard of Bass Guitars,</p>
      <p>and correctly assume that low drums make Bass as well.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We should really split them up,</p>
      <p>so that they can grow in their own ways.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>If we let drums be drums,</p>
      <p>and let bass guitars be guitars.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>They won't step onto each others toes as much,</p>
      <p>and we will be able to layer bass on top of drums.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>If we have multiple drum arrangements,</p>
      <p>and multiple bass arrangements,</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We will be able to mix them up together,</p>
      <p>to easily bring in new freshness to a song.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Let us create three drum arrangements,</p>
      <p>and three bass melodies, and see what we get when we play all the permutations.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We begin with a drum,</p>
      <p>and I hope you are in a car, cars have really good speakers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The worst speakers I ever encountered are laptop speakers,</p>
      <p>and then popular $50 over the ear headphones are the second best after the car.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>If you don't like over the ear,</p>
      <p>then sub $10 ear-buds with good reviews will do.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>If you are getting into music composition,</p>
      <p>consider doing it in a car with good speakers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Let's lay down some drum beat here,</p>
      <p>I got three variations for you.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Low lets make some bass,</p>
      <p>making bass melodies is very cool, it is similar to making a tiny piano melody.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>One interesting thing worth mentioning is that when you make a bass melody for one bass guitar,</p>
      <p>it will sound good on kind of bass guitars with different configurations.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Here are three variations,</p>
      <p>each variations repeats the melody three times.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Now here are the permutations,</p>
      <p>look what great impact bass guitar or synthesis has on drums.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The drums come to life,</p>
      <p>in a way that is not possible with a drum kit alone.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>If you ever encounter bass related noise, cracking, or distortion,</p>
      <p>that is a very common occurrence with a very easy fix.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Cracking occurs when two base instruments are playing one over the other,</p>
      <p>to repair this use an equalizer, remove some of the low frequencies from the bass guitar.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Here are the permutations:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    <div class="section">
      <p>I feel like I should add, that, voice with a low pitch,</p>
      <p>even if lowered artificially goes really well with drums and guitar.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You don't have to sing or growl,</p>
      <p>personally I love it when I can make a song out of random things that sound funny/</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The song you are about to hear does not really try to create a narrative,</p>
      <p>I kind of see my voice recordings as an instrument.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Whatever meaning a listener gets out of the mostly random gibberish,</p>
      <p>is bound to be funny, or perplexing, and that is a huge bonus in my opinion.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>When I try to come up with these strange lyrics,</p>
      <p>I think of school, or what is the first thing I said to a stranger in America, just random stuff like that.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It just happens to be Groundhog Day in a couple of hours,</p>
      <p>so I threw in a dialogue about the creature as well.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Don't try to create a funny song,</p>
      <p>just have fun while making a song, and it will come our funny.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Here is the final product,</p>
      <p>enjoy:</p>
