      <p>The Universe works in very honest ways,</p>
      <p>when liars take to power; the honest become powerful.</p>

    <section>
      <p>When we face impossible problems,</p>
      <p>someone will remind us; all human problems have human solutions.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>When governments become too complex,</p>
      <p>the Congress will call on you to help them regain their vision.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>When liars start winning all the battles,</p>
      <p>your wisdom will become even more precious.</p>

      <p>A senator's boy brought into positions of authority,</p>
      <p>by means of favors, shortcuts, and being told what to say, can't become wise.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Wisdom grows from within our authenticity, dignity, and love,</p>
      <p>from clarity of vision, and being moved by generations of giants.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Authenticity helps us up,</p>
      <p>wisdom on top of wisdom, plateau by plateau onward to greatness.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Inauthenticity, can only build temporary things,</p>
      <p>that soon collapse under their own weight for lack of foundation.</p>

      <p>Just because you feel hopelessness,</p>
      <p>when you dream about making the world a better place...</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>It does not mean you should stop loving, thinking, writing,</p>
      <p>when the future comes asking: what is next?</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Your books are to be complete, beloved, and held in high esteem,</p>
      <p>your works must move the world.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>All that is true, and worthy of human kind,</p>
      <p>requires generations of work, same inspiration, same vision.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>May your works serve as the first stepping stone,</p>
      <p>a source of rules that will keep Humanity Safe and Sound.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>May your works inspire countless generations,</p>
      <p>across all the world's nations.</p>
