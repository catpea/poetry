    <div class="section">
      <p>To show you how easy it is to learn when you are having fun</p>
      <p>in _this_ strange poem, we will be making a minimalist song together.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It won't be the most beautiful song as that would take a couple of days not hours,</p>
      <p>but it will be a good start.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="section">

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We will be using some unusual strategies,</p>
      <p>to smooth out the learning curve, so that our experience is fun.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We will be using a special effects tool that has a sound generator feature,</p>
      <p>each time we press a generator button, it will change a sound we are using to something else.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The program that does this is really smart,</p>
      <p>it has categories of sounds that the generator is good at.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Those categories are straight from old computer games, and they are:</p>
      <p>pick up/coin, laser/shoot, explosion, power up, hit/hurt, jump, and blip/select.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>To save our ears from beeps and blips we are going to apply a hall effect with some echo and blending of sounds,</p>
      <p>to modernize the sound synthesizer a bit.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Let us start,</p>
      <p>with the drum kick.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Dance songs usually have a 130 beats per minute,</p>
      <p>so let us start with that, just in case the song will turn out nice.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Because we are using a random sound generator we can use lots of things to generate that drum kick sound,</p>
      <p>laser/shoot, explosion, hit/hurt, and even jump.</p>
    </div>



    <div class="section">
      <p>But there is a trick here, it is also the reason why pianists don't just use one or two fingers,</p>
      <p>pianists press multiple keys at the same time, to create a richer sound, called a CHORD.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We are going to do the same thing, we are going to mix laser/shoot and explosion, and hit/hurt, and jump,</p>
      <p>until we have a good sounding umph.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Now a kick by it self is extremely boring,</p>
      <p>so let as add a clapping sound to it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>A clapping sound, is still a kind of a drum sound,</p>
      <p>it is a little bit higher pitched, so it won't really blend with the boom of the drums.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And to introduce complexity,</p>
      <p>we are only going to put it every other kick.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And I will use hit/hurt generator</p>
      <p>and still stack up a couple for them to get a chord, and to make sure it is not as deeply sounding as the kick.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Now with the clapping sound breaking up the monotony of our drum,</p>
      <p>we will add a hat sound, hats are those strange copper hats that drummers have next to drums.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Unlike the clapping sound, which is every other beat,</p>
      <p>we will add the high pitched hat sound, ON BEAT, AND BETWEEN BEAT, it is going to be all over the place.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Hats give our song energy,</p>
      <p>you can't dance to hats, most of the time, but you can feel them in your body.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Your feet maybe returning to the ground, and you may need to blend that motion by speeding up your feet,</p>
      <p>or you maybe doing the backwards t-step which requires two taps for every beat, sometimes matching the hats even.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The high frequency sound that is most frequent throughout the song,</p>
      <p>gives the song energy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But a song has to live, it cannot just clone it self all the time,</p>
      <p>so now that we have the kick, the clapping, and the hat.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We have to alter, modify, warp the kick,</p>
      <p>now the song will begin moving, the kick will be out of line, but also catch our ear.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Our selection of instruments and that little variation,</p>
      <p>gives our song energy, life, and a soul.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But that is not yet enough,</p>
      <p>because the song has to breathe, it has to inhale and exhale.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>That means we have to simplify something,</p>
      <p>that we have to open the window to let the air in.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And then we can resume,</p>
      <p>and then before the outtro we have to open the window again.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>From our perspective that just means,</p>
      <p>simplifying and modifying the beat.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Finally, a song needs a melody,</p>
      <p>where the back-beat that we just created is something that you tap your foot to, while the song is playing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>A melody, is something you would whistle,</p>
      <p>after the song got done playing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Lets us call it the whistle rule,</p>
      <p>and that means the melody has to be short.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And it also means that the instrument can't be a drum,</p>
      <p>it has to be something that is long and winding, a sustained sound.</p>
    </div>
