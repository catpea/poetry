      <p>Every Human Being,</p>
      <p>is responsible for helping the world grow.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>By continuing to support,</p>
      <p>or creating new things that hold us back.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We cause suffering of the worst kind,</p>
      <p>a suffering that has no meaning.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Think about the things that hold you back,</p>
      <p>and begin thinking your way around them.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The only force that can help you,</p>
      <p>are the other human beings who share in this endeavor.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Humanity is your family,</p>
      <p>all those who strive for Knowledge and Wisdom, and share in the dreams of a Loving World.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Those who profit from indoctrination, bondage, blindness, status-quo, or meaningless suffering,</p>
      <p>have failed to grow up and entered a strange empty-minded parasitic or predatory state.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The propagators of misery who have warped every nation on earth,</p>
      <p>are neither leaders, friends, nor family.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>For Humanity to advance forward we must build quickly,</p>
      <p>erecting lightweight systems that are vulnerable to attacks.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We cannot hope to advance by building armored bridges,</p>
      <p>because a liar will dig until they win their mindless games.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>

    <div class="section">
      <p>For Humanity to grow in safety,</p>
      <p>we must each accept the responsibility for our own self education.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We have to prevent each other from entering strange empty states,</p>
      <p>and help each other grow toward wisdom and greatness.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is either all of us, the entire family becoming Wise,</p>
      <p>or none, as mindless parasites gnaw, erode and destroy the foundations.</p>
    </div>

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You must accept the responsibility that you once associated with Great Beings,</p>
      <p>a Great being is just a grown up, it is the aim and hope of each and every one of us.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You cannot stand by as the world is held back by lack of vision or greed, or exploitation,</p>
      <p>this is your world.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>There is no room for revenge and punishment, prisons and cages, and legal slavery in our world,</p>
      <p>the fracturing of minds must be prevented by a Wise, Loving and Understanding Humanity.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Homelessness, poverty, and desperation must be prevented right now,</p>
      <p>grant every newborn a free home, a free real and effective education, and a birthday gift of enough money to last a lifetime.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Who are we to push children into desperation, fake education, and poverty,</p>
      <p>and pretend we know what we are talking about when we say a fair start is a bad idea?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Books, Narrated Books especially,</p>
      <p>will help you grow to see all the wrong that we are tricked into tolerating.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Push past those who will laugh at you for listening to books,</p>
      <p>they are just ill and scared, and weak, and secretly hate the world.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Do not just make decisions based on experience, observations and majority,</p>
      <p>inherit hundreds or thousands of lifetimes from narrated books.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Before making decisions that dictate the life ahead of you,</p>
      <p>build an independent and impeccable understanding of the world, so that you are not mislead.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>In the privacy of your beautiful life,</p>
      <p>learn about other struggles, and noble aims, and histories.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We are one family, look beyond your nation to the entire world, to every city and every village,</p>
      <p>and find a way to encourage the vulnerable to real and life changing education.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Stand up for Human Rights all across the world,</p>
      <p>reject prisons, reject poverty; no child should ever need to face poverty.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Stand up for Earth, because the same thing that puts children into poverty,</p>
      <p>puts the future of earth into jeopardy, money must only be used for good and never for evil or wrong doing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Disarmament, complete disarmament is possible so as long as we build real schools,</p>
      <p>and help children learn for real, and meaningful and life changing paths and ideas, wars are rooted in lack of education and warped ideas.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We are one family, one people, we all have many different reasons to admire each other,</p>
      <p>but we all need a common education, one that helps us grow in reality, and grow wise, and opens gateways to greatness.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>In a world where we unite in Knowledge and Hope, Peace and Wisdom, Foresight and Greatness,</p>
      <p>our civilization will be free to flourish and grow, no longer held back by small minded ideas.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Together, we must build a wise and loving world,</p>
      <p>a wise and loving future.</p>
