      <p>Oh it was cold that morning,</p>
      <p>the sudden change came without warning.</p>

    <section>
      <p>While the sunsets are over the sea,</p>
      <p>the sunrise, must rise from behind dunes.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>There are no dunes taller than these,</p>
      <p>they are ancient, born of frozen seas.</p>

    <section>
      <p>The deer were the first to rise,</p>
      <p>to them belonged the sunrise.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>There is a place where the dunes part,</p>
      <p>by some unknown art.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The deers come out,</p>
      <p>it is their lake, no doubt.</p>

      <p>When the sun finally made it,</p>
      <p>the warm air rolled down the dune.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The symphony of the ancient forest,</p>
      <p>perfectly in tune.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Then the birds rose,</p>
      <p>and their breakfast followed.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Two eagles came by,</p>
      <p>to keep an eye from the sky.</p>

      <p>My beloved Seagull friend and I rejoiced,</p>
      <p>another perfect morning.</p>

    <section>
      <p>(My seagull friend's name is Bob.</p>
      <p>I called them all Bob.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I had difficulty telling them apart,</p>
      <p>but I sure got their names right.</p>

    <section>
      <p>Seaguls, are the kittens of the sea,</p>
      <p>and they are all very mighty.)</p>
