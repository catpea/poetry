    <div class="section">
      <p>Who includes diversity and is Nature,</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Who is the amplitude of the earth, and the coarseness and sexuality of the earth, and the great charity of the earth and the equilibrium also,</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Who has not look&#x2019;d forth from the windows the eyes for nothing, or whose brain held audience with messengers for nothing,</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Who contains believers and disbelievers, who is the most majestic lover,</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Who holds duly his or her triune proportion of realism, spiritualism, and of the &#xE6;sthetic or intellectual,</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Who having consider&#x2019;d the body finds all its organs and parts good,</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Who, out of the theory of the earth and of his or her body understands by subtle analogies all other theories,</p>
      <p>The theory of a city, a poem, and of the large politics of these States;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Who believes not only in our globe with its sun and moon, but in other globes with their suns and moons,</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Who, constructing the house of himself or herself, not for a day but for all time, sees races, eras, dates, generations,</p>
      <p>The past, the future, dwelling there, like space, inseparable together.</p>
