    <section>
      <p>We are born to run our fingers through infinity,</p>
      <p>be it Wright Brothers or Yuri Gagarin, Galileo Galilei.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>It is our right to touch the greatest of heights,</p>
      <p>and it is our privilege to cheer for each other in triumph.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>We have no flaws, no ugliness, no weakness, and no limit,</p>
      <p>be it Tenzing and Hillary, or Viktor Emil Frankl.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Nothing can stop us,</p>
      <p>there are no bars thick enough,</p>
      <p>there are no bars strong enough,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>"We are the Captains of our Souls,</p>
      <p>And The Masters of Out Fate"</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>However, there is a culture that we must never let go of,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The culture of, Love of Wisdom,</p>
      <p>The culture of, Inheritance of Knowledge.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>If we are tricked to reject Wisdom,</p>
      <p>and if there is no teacher or parent,</p>
      <p>or friend left to remind us,</p>
      <p>then all will be lost.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Your work will not set you free,</p>
      <p>it is a lie as old as slavery.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Your teachers can only remind,</p>
      <p>but they cannot reach into your mind.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Fight for your right to knowledge,</p>
      <p>there is no university,</p>
      <p>there is no college,</p>
      <p>you have to use your heart to learn,</p>
      <p>only you can do that.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Without Inheritance of Wisdom,</p>
      <p>you will become cursed to start at zero.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>As magnificent as your battle will be,</p>
      <p>you will only reach a path, that was walked countless times before.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>You must start,</p>
      <p>where the greatest minds <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Science_communicators">left off</a>.</p>
