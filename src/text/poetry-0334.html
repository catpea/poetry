      <p>We have to be really careful with believing in what schools can do for us,</p>
      <p>and no matter what we need to accept the responsibility for our own education.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Our knowledge is too sacred,</p>
      <p>to entrust somebody else with.</p>

      <p>School is great for memorizing language,</p>
      <p>and memorizing how to write, and spell.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Because these things are _meant_ to be memorized,</p>
      <p>stored within our memory for recall.</p>

      <p>But a formula is a little machine,</p>
      <p>a little engine, or program.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It must be taken apart,</p>
      <p>explained, studied and understood.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The teacher must be able to show you how fascinating it is,</p>

      <p>If a teacher tricks you into thinking you are just not smart,</p>
      <p>that is a setup.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>They are kind-of neutralizing you,</p>
      <p>preventing you from standing up and saying:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>"But you only made us memorize it,</p>
      <p>and that is not learning, that is just forcing us into acting like we have learned.."</p>

      <p>They rarely need to go this far, they learn from each other to be cunning,</p>
      <p>they will just threaten you with failing the class, if you don't memorize.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>When a teacher says "study for the test tomorrow",</p>
      <p>that is them encouraging you to memorize it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>To study something requires months and years, journals and research,</p>

      <p>This right here is the reason why you need to read books,</p>
      <p>these people are making you pretend that you are getting an education, so that they get a paycheck.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And this is completely flying over your head,</p>
      <p>you have to be smarter than the teachers.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Even if only to stop stressing about classes and grades,</p>
      <p>you have to be good to yourself.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And just for that tiny reason alone,</p>

      <p>Please, if you have bad grades, that just means you are naturally rejecting brainless memorization,</p>
      <p>that does not mean you are unintelligent.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>That actually means that you find inner-workings of formulas and systems,</p>
      <p>delightful and most enlightening.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>As we grow more mature, we all develop a tendency to prefer real knowledge over memorized gibberish,</p>
      <p>people with bad grades tend to be more mature than those who accept memorization without any discomfort.</p>
