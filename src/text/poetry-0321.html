      <p>You know how every once in a while you hear a beautiful piano song,</p>
      <p>and when it is over something is missing, something feels too quiet.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It means that the piano,</p>
      <p>or whatever it is that is moving you, is calling to you.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>That something in your heart, soul,</p>
      <p>and even health, needs it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I don't know what it is that call to us,</p>
      <p>but I know it is from an Aquamarine Ocean somehow.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And that it is timeless,</p>
      <p>and that it is part of us.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The same way that the yellow of the Dandelion would call to us,</p>
      <p>had we ever been sentenced to a gray world.</p>
    </div>

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>To be too busy, _even if saving the world_,</p>
      <p>to answer that Aquamarine call, is to make the Universe weep.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Did you know,</p>
      <p>that most of the piano keys don't go together very well.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>That you start with a key you like,</p>
      <p>and then you search for the best move, like in a game of chess?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Do you know why a blank canvas,</p>
      <p>can sell for a fortune?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Because it is not what we achieve in the end,</p>
      <p>the end, is an end.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is what we achieve on our way there,</p>
      <p>it is not what we master come our golden age, but what we can create along the way.</p>

      <p>Nobody wants a perfect piano song,</p>
      <p>they wouldn't understand it, because there is no understanding it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>What people understand and appreciate the most,</p>
      <p>is the perfectly flawed progress forward.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Not towards machine like perfection,</p>
      <p>but towards living in harmony with what is Perfectly Human.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Try, fail, learn, and try again,</p>
      <p>onward to knowledge, wisdom and greatness.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>As beautiful as the other Great Apes are,</p>
      <p>in the chaos of the universe we have been singled out for Knowledge, Wisdom, and Greatness.</p>

      <p>There is so much you have to do in life,</p>

      <p>Before you start contemplating graduations, and diplomas, and doctorates, and careers,</p>
      <p>slow down, slow all the way down.</p>

      <p>Come back down to Earth,</p>
      <p>to the ocean, and the mountains, and the forests, and the lakes.</p>

      <p>Come to live in the now,</p>
      <p>strive to become an athlete or a dancer so that you never ache,</p>

      <p>And take care of your mind,</p>
      <p>so that you have all the answers ahead of time, and not when it is too late.</p>

      <p>This here, is your time to live, to bloom,</p>
      <p>and the world before you is _yours_ to experience in full.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>May the libraries serve you as an endless source of beautiful Audio Books,</p>
      <p>and may your Backpacking Gear and Hammock always be ready.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Find your favorite Aquamarine to start with,</p>
      <p>and weave your song, help the world understand.</p>
