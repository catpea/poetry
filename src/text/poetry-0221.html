      <p>Here our Heroines discovered that Social Networks could be used as Human Intelligence based Computer,</p>
      <p>and that all it required to build entire governments was the concept of nested groups, (mathematically speaking graphs of sets to which users belong to).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Their research revealed that in 1960's Detroit, Michigan</p>
      <p>was one of the largest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_Cities_Program">Model Cities</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And yet again, that old foe of corruption has emerged,</p>
      <p>Model Cities were destroyed by "complicated bureaucracy, inadequate funding, and competing agendas at the local level".</p>

      <p>However, the girls have already worked out,</p>
      <p>most of the Anti-Corruption measures.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>There will be no such thing as a brand,</p>
      <p>or guild.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>There will be schools that help people come together,</p>
      <p>but the people who satisfy tasks will have their school path, rating and comments to serve as their license.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>New comes to a field, such as landscaping,</p>
      <p>will charge less until they gain high star rating.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>If a large group does grow, it will become divided in two or four,</p>
      <p>and this decision will be voted on, by the local community.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>It is of some note, that a Landscaping Professional,</p>
      <p>claiming a bounty for taking care of a particular set of Condominiums, for example,</p>
      <p>can accept cash directly from those who posted the landscaping bounty.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Cosmopolis does not extract a fee for completion of a task or exchange of funds,</p>
      <p>there is no need for a bank, storing sensitive information, or constant security audits.</p>
    </section>

    <section>

    </section>

    <section>
      <p>It is really important to be able to to imagine a visit from a landscaping professional,</p>
      <p>as a function of Cosmopolis, as an intelligent computer dispatching a human to solve a problem.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>When temporary switching to this view,</p>
      <p>Cosmopolis becomes an entity powered by the intelligence of millions of humans beings.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The extremely simple idea of voting within a group,</p>
      <p>is all the force behind Cosmopolis, it is its intelligence.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>When a medical professional notices that the community he is part of could use a hospital,</p>
      <p>he can file a Request for Change, and all the members of the community will vote yes or no,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Matters as complex as building a hospital require tens of thousands of tasks,</p>
      <p>ranging from arranging for funds, to increasing tips, bounties and scholarships,</p>
      <p>so that come a near future, the hospital can begin training medical students.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>In some cases, simple program logic will trigger the call for voting on building a new Hospital,</p>
      <p>and then human beings will bring in their Intelligence and Expertise.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>This scenario serves as an example of Deus Ex Machina,</p>
      <p>an intelligent machine powered by Massively Multiuser Self Assembling Intelligence (MMSAI)</p>
