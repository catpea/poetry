      <p>You have to punch through what everyone else is saying,</p>
      <p>if something feels wrong, you walk, you get out, you don't let people push you.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Long time ago, we had these little schools,</p>
      <p>that taught reading, writing, and arithmetic.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And people loved them, everyone loved and admired them,</p>
      <p>it was a true gift, and teachers were True Angels of Wisdom.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But schools require funding,</p>
      <p>part of that funding is paying teachers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And what that means is:</p>
      <p>money.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Everyone suddenly was a teacher,</p>
      <p>and to optimize money, testing, testing, testing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>This is not a school anymore,</p>
      <p>this is a business, all the teachers now take a paycheck home.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The concept of grades is very iffy, very lazy, a teacher should talk to the parent.</p>
      <p>if grades used to work, then maybe they didn't matter much, somehow.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But over time,</p>
      <p>with everyone busy optimizing things to get or make more money.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>With schools everywhere needing funding,</p>
      <p>with teachers needing to get paid.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Nobody would have noticed,</p>
      <p>when grades became everything.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Same with tests, nobody noticed when lectures became too abstract,</p>
      <p>and people just started memorizing for tests to get good grades.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>So now, we have a school, that needs funding,</p>
      <p>teachers that need to get paid.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And lectures and tests,</p>
      <p>setup in a way where majority passes by memorization.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And then there are those who assume that teachers are there to teach,</p>
      <p>and that the abstract disconnected lectures actually make sense.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>They don't know everyone is memorizing,</p>
      <p>they assume they are just not smart enough.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>C, and D, an occasional B+. but mostly Cs,</p>
      <p>it wouldn't occur to them that teachers are looking at other classes and give the same grade.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Nor would it occur to them that statistically a certain number of students,</p>
      <p>should have bad grades, and the teacher will make that happen as not to stick out.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And then there is the big one, the biggie,</p>
      <p>the one that nobody talks about, that inconvenient fact.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The grades, are actually a performance score of how well the teacher is teaching,</p>
      <p>and they have not a darn thing to do with any of the students.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You can't learn disconnected facts,</p>
      <p>you can only temporarily memorize them.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Your grades are are reflection of how inclined you are to participate in a memorization charade,</p>
      <p>that fetches the teacher money, and keeps your school operating.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>They have to get paid,</p>
      <p>they have to put food on their table.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>They can't teach, because that would mean addressing every student,</p>
      <p>that is just not possible, and they would rather get a job elsewhere.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>More importantly, they won't know, they won't even care, when you do find something that you like,</p>
      <p>they will take that away you, because there is no time for you to learn, you have to pass tests that are in class right now.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>If you don't pass the standardized tests that are an insult to your uniqueness, your predispositions, talents and creativity,</p>
      <p>the teacher will have to be transferred to another school as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hh6uHUx728">lemon</a> and that makes them look bad.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>How dare you,</p>
      <p>how dare you little child.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>They will behave high and mighty,</p>
      <p>while selling your mind for a paycheck.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Do yo see?</p>
      <p>do you see?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The tests were never a judgment of you,</p>
      <p>they are just the simplest way to track who the worst teachers are.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Everything that surrounds you in school is created with the least amount of effort,</p>
      <p>they are using grades to make you feel bad, so that you will memorize and pretend to learn, so that everyone keeps getting paid.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>That is what the teacher wants,</p>
      <p>put food on the table.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>They don't know what it means to get bad grades,</p>
      <p>the fact that they are a teachers shows that they crammed, memorized and probably were proud of their meaningless grades.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is so strange that someone solving a math problem with memorized formulas, thinks that they understand it - they don't,</p>
      <p>they must understand how the formulas work, and it is easy and beautiful.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>To begin learning mathematics for real, you need to even out the playing field with a simple programming language,</p>
      <p>because to quote <a href="https://github.com/Jam3/math-as-code">Math As Code</a>, "Mathematical symbols can mean different things depending on the author, context and the field of study (linear algebra, set theory, etc)."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>So, you aren't even learning real math,</p>
      <p>and beyond that as you create or re-create your formulas in a simple programming language, it makes sense to plug them in, and create interactive visualizations.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And of course, before you start learning math, you need a reason to lean math, which would be creating computer games,</p>
      <p>designing Screen Savers, Music Visualizations, Generative Art, or Generative Music, even stuff for making videos.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>More than that, you can't learn math when someone tells you to,</p>
      <p>your mind has to be ready, and that may take a long time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And you need to see the full picture, because as fun as Generative Art is,</p>
      <p>you need to know why you need it...</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The reason why you need generative art,</p>
      <p>is so that you may exhibit your works at Guggenheim, creating another product line, or helping students learn how to be more like you.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The point of it all, is to build a breathtaking portfolio,</p>
      <p>describing a series of companies that you built.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I can't even imagine what schools must think we are,</p>
      <p>for them to treat us the way they do, and where exactly are they directing us?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>College, Debt and Cubicle? ... College, Brand Name University, and Lab?</p>
      <p>And for how long, for ever? In a cubicle? Or is it until we start dreaming about opening up our own business - because we can do that as teenagers, and actually learn something for real in the process.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    <div class="section">
      <p>We are each unique, we have different curiosities that mark natural starting points for real education,</p>
      <p>but they will all lead to art, computers, and sciences, AND in a way that actually empowers you, makes you more powerful.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Bad grades, are just a sign that schools only care about funding,</p>
      <p>and teachers only care about getting you to pretend to know, so that they get paid.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Bad grades are not real,</p>
      <p>they just reveal the reality of fake education.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You are just as smart as everyone else,</p>
      <p>and your rejection of blind memorization is a sign of and affinity for great authenticity, I'll let you discover where that will take you, on your own.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>For all the naysayers, and apologetic teachers with great excuses,</p>
      <p>the principals, and the students with perfect grades, I understand what you are saying.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But that is not worth a single student crying her self to sleep at night,</p>
      <p>because her grades and teachers are trying to convince her she is stupid, because she is failing your stupid make-believe schools that will lead all into debt and stress.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I honestly believe that people with bad grades,</p>
      <p>mature faster, and are in a way gifted, but schools trick them and show them that they have no future, and sometimes this robs them of their beautiful gift.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>All the schools are not worth,</p>
      <p>a single student crying her self to sleep.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>All of these thoughts can be easily dismissed as a conspiracy theory,</p>
      <p>until we rephrase them as accusations of fraud.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>So,</p>
      <p>let us ask.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Why are schools getting funding,</p>
      <p>when graduating student do not feel that they have received a real education.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Why are grades being used on students,</p>
      <p>when they do more damage than good.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Why is there a standard curriculum,</p>
      <p>when everybody has different curiosities, a different pace of learning, and holds a unique constellation of knowledge.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>How can an institution refer to it self as a school,</p>
      <p>when it causes stress that often leads to tears, and low self esteem.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Furthermore,</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Standardized schools have a tendency to convince students to spend their parents money or go into debt from overpriced college,</p>
      <p>a paid education, with unforgivable debt, with a significant percentage of students pushed into drugs and alcohol.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The jobs that college graduates get are often less than advertised,</p>
      <p>terrible job interviews, with bad starting salaries, and awful entry level positions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>All of this shows signs of fraud, neglect, and lies, and more lies.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>All of this can be repaired with a Personalized Education with the Aid of Computers,</p>
      <p>and with a focus on building small companies that will help the students to financial independence, rather than debt.</p>
