      <p>No worries, the only real darkness is the Twilight of Hesitation,</p>
      <p>it is dangerous because it makes time go by all too fast.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>So you just have to make a promise to your self,</p>
      <p>that each day will be a tiny-tiny itsy-bitsy better; than then previous.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Other than that, no cloud could ever stop the sun from rising,</p>
      <p>nothing can endanger your brilliance, there is nothing to fear.</p>

      <p>And brilliance,</p>
      <p>brilliance leads to enlightenment.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>So as long as you protect your light,</p>
      <p>know that wisdom is your right.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Never stand still and always take to flight,</p>
      <p>yours is enlightenment, the brightest of light.</p>

      <p>Never has there been a night,</p>
      <p>that was wasn't lit by light.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Never has there been a fight,</p>
      <p>that wasn't won by Wisdom's Might.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Rise, rise in spite of the fright,</p>
      <p>rise to no end in sight.</p>
