      <p>If you are not shaking, and you voice is not broken, from screaming an yelling at the Congress,</p>
      <p>when they called you in for questioning - but they had to drag you out,</p>
      <p>for screaming - about the disgrace of insider trading, and corruption.</p>

      <p>Because you couldn't keep yourself from being a bright dying star,</p>

      <p>If you aren't standing at the Diag, making the moron that was just there shaking with anger,</p>
      <p>because you took his microphone, and you started quoting Dawkins, Hitchens, Harris, Dennett, and Ayaan Hirsi Ali,</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Because it is just enough of evil for that particular day,</p>
      <p>and you would, save the sunset by bringing in the Saints.</p>

      <p>And if you never painted you car pink, especially the interior, because the Pepto Bismol didn't work,</p>
      <p>and you had nowhere to go and noting to eat, but forward and a bag of stale old chips.</p>

      <p>"Grow strong, my comrade â€¦ that you may stand</p>
      <p>Unshaken when I fall; that I may know</p>
      <p>The shattered fragments of my song will come</p>
      <p>At last to finer melody in you;</p>
      <p>That I may tell my heart that you begin</p>
      <p>Where passing I leave off, and fathom more."</p>

      <p>My Friends,</p>
      <p>we are not to live quiet little lives,</p>
      <p>because we only get one each.</p>

      <p>And the way to turn the volume up,</p>
      <p>is to inherit wisdom from all the great beings,</p>
      <p>at all cost at any cost,</p>
      <p>because without their light we can't tell where we are going.</p>

      <p>All those great beings,</p>
      <p>are sharing lifetimes of wisdom with you.</p>
