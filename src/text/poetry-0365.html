      <p>This poem is many things; a day dream, a regular dream, a hope, a wish,</p>
      <p>a promise, a solution and a problem, a tutorial, and a school of thinking.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Come back to it if you can,</p>
      <p>I hope that it will always have something new to offer.</p>

      <p>The ultimate goal is to limit how much damage a single liar can cause to a system,</p>
      <p>that means computer programs should be used to structure a system.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Humans will always be needed, but in a computerized automated system,</p>
      <p>the amount of damage they cause can be greatly limited.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Once caught,</p>
      <p>the system can be altered to prevent that attack vector from re-emerging.</p>

      <p>Do not fall into the trap of rule and inference engines,</p>
      <p>they are a limited fairy tale, if they did work, they'd replace Linux.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The system architecture is simple, it is just black boxes,</p>
      <p>question in answer out.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It should be written in a language that runs in the browser,</p>
      <p>and on the server, so <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oefKzjCU4w">ES2020</a> at the time of writing.</p>

      <p>Avoid the Graphic User Interface,</p>
      <p>use a Chat Interface, or a Conversational Interface.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>This is what this program does,</p>
      <p>it answers questions.</p>

      <p>Now, this is a system that will help you launch your company,</p>
      <p>it will help you build a school if you are interested in such a thing,</p>
      <p>but above all this is a system meant to change the world.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It must be fully accessible to every human being on this planet,</p>
      <p>even the 290–363 Australian Aboriginal groups that speak unique languages.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Therefore, before a program is written,</p>
      <p>the process must be described in a normal language that can be translated.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Once a paragraph captures a point,</p>
      <p>a program will be written and connected to it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>For example, one may wish to ask:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Is the three strike pattern in law humane?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>A program named "Is the three strike pattern in law humane?",</p>
      <p>will be created, and it can be as simple as:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>function(){</p>
      <p>return {value: false, text:"No."}</p>
      <p>}</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Now currently, a lot of people are under the mis-impression</p>
      <p>that if someone shoplifts diapers three times...</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>They should lose their baby,</p>
      <p>and go to prison.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Where prison guards in their madness and stress,</p>
      <p>will deny them feminine hygiene products</p>
      <p>in order to demand obedience under the 13th amendment of United States.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Our simple program, will immediately cause great upset,</p>
      <p>you don't need to be trying to run a small city government.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>This question may come up in your first start-up, if you live in a three strike state,</p>
      <p>someone could for example have stolen and sold a laptop, and you are wondering if you should call the police.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>So here, we will need another question:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Should I call the Police?</p>
      <p>and again a program named: "Should I call the Police?"</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You see the importance of naming a program after the question,</p>
      <p>if the question changes, it will become disassociated from the program, as it will have a different meaning then.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>function(){</p>
      <p>let response = {value: undefined, text:"undecided"};</p>
      <p>const numberOfOffences = await user('How many offenses does the suspect have?');</p>
      <p>if(numberOfOffenses = 0) response = {value: false, text:"No. Do not cause arrest, on first offense."}</p>
      <p>if(numberOfOffenses = 1) response = {value: undefined, text:"Use your own judgment."}</p>
      <p>if(numberOfOffenses = 2){</p>
      <p>if(await answer('Is the three strike pattern in law humane?')){</p>
      <p>response = {value: true, text:"Yes, as the three strike pattern is considered humane"};</p>
      <p>}else{</p>
      <p>response = {value: false, text:"No, as the additional offense will result in imprisonment. Please handle internally."};</p>
      <p>}</p>
      <p>}</p>
      <p>return response;</p>
      <p>}</p>
    </div>


    <div class="section">
      <p>So here is a more advanced rule, that features a user call, and a sub-question.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>When you await user, the bot you are talking to will ask you a question, like Siri does,</p>
      <p>it will ask you a question related to your query, 'How many offenses does the suspect have?'.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Notice that something amazing is happening, the computer is interfacing with you,</p>
      <p>it is asking you a question that it then transforms into a number and uses it in a calculation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It didn't know something, so it used a Human, the Ghost In The Machine,</p>
      <p>to figure it out.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Let me give you another example just to clarify,</p>
      <p>when you need help during self checkout, when something goes wrong, from the perspective of the program,</p>
      <p>a human will be dispatched to resolve the problem.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And one more example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Turk">The Mechanical Turk</a> was a chess playing machine,</p>
      <p>that from a perspective we need here, used a Human as a CPU.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The Human Heart will forever be more Compassionate, Creative, Loving, and Willing to Change than the best AI,</p>
      <p>we are the original thinkers and out-thinkers, we will forever be best at it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>In a machine circuit as you see here, the decision making is so limited,</p>
      <p>and accountability so easily traceable, that if there is ever any room for corruption here, it will be easily closed.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="section">
      <p>At this point, the program prefers to do nothing if there is no offense,</p>
      <p>if there is one it leave it up to you, for example if that person is hateful it maybe an idea to file a second offense,</p>
      <p>and if they have two offenses then the program will ask it self: 'Is the three strike pattern in law humane?'</p>
      <p>if the answer is yes, then the person will go to prison, if the answer is no it is not humane, then you will be instructed to handle this situation internally.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>These programs are meant to grow,</p>
      <p>perhaps even to tens of millions of lines.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>They will look into things based on age,</p>
      <p>based on education level, based on upbringing, and even gang involvement.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Meaning that if the person that stole has been brought up in a gang neighborhood,</p>
      <p>then they should not be punished, as they require therapy and un-indoctrination from the culture of taking.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Now, listen to this.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>A Judge, who hates criminals, because they have tarnished his city,</p>
      <p>because that is what everyone else also quietly believes in his courtroom.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>When he has a bad day, he stubs his toe,</p>
      <p>his coffee is cold, and all the other things fell on his head....</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>He is no longer impartial in the eyes of Justice,</p>
      <p>but he likable in the eyes of the city.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>He will now be removed from decision making,</p>
      <p>he will now ask the 10 million line version of the program above, answer some questions,</p>
      <p>and now recommend therapy, not more abuse by prison guards and more.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Now, The People, which are in charge of a company, school, city, state, nation, and Earth,</p>
      <p>will be able to re-run the same calculation the District Judge did.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Will be able to see a story of questions,</p>
      <p>and if they find some of those questions unethical, or outdated, then they will begin a social voting process,</p>
      <p>to change a particular line of the program.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>At this point, we might as well make amnesty law more common,</p>
      <p>and allow those who have been incarcerated under the previous version of the system, to be set free.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>As it would be unethical not to,</p>
      <p>this too would be a function call, described in the system.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Furthermore, elected officials would be automatically un-elected,</p>
      <p>when they cross certain lines, such as failure to meet campaign promises.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>As you can see, simple programs CAN fix the corruption of a city,</p>
      <p>but they require classroom upon a classroom, school upon a school to focus on their invention.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>They require the participation of at least fifty million of young and inspired minds,</p>
      <p>the teenagers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The program will grow the same way World Encyclopedia Does,</p>
      <p>the petitions to change rules will work the same as the Old White House Petitions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We don't need to create a parallel system to current US law,</p>
      <p>nobody even know how many laws they are, and many are illogical, inconsistent, if not crazy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We just need a system that is better than the courts,</p>
      <p>a system that is better than at handling elections and ejections.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>A system that grows with us,</p>
      <p>a system that is powered by the best in us.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Not for me, not for you,</p>
      <p>but for the future, because the future requires clear decision-making, and clear and inspired thinking.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Begin studies of ES2020, and begin writing your first program with the use of functions,</p>
      <p>or maybe the Event Emitter.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Build it for your own company,</p>
      <p>for a school you wished you had,</p>
      <p>build it for the city, state, nation, and the world.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Don't ask what the future can do for you,</p>
      <p>but what you can do for the future.</p>
    </div>
