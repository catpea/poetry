      <p>Think about Parkour or Skateboarding,</p>
      <p>as they require practice, growth, advancement, and getting good at.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Imagine someone getting out there,</p>
      <p>and trying to pretend to be good at Parkour or Skateboarding.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The fakers would be instantly revealed,</p>
      <p>and would start practicing more, learning for real, and certainly stop pretending.</p>
    </div>

      <p>In world politics, nobody gets hurt when they are lying,</p>
      <p>in fact what makes a good political lie, is that the liar can't get caught.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>When a political liar is never revealed as a liar,</p>
      <p>that does not mean that they actually know Politics, Parkour or Skateboarding.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Just staying beneath the public radar and not getting caught,</p>
      <p>does not make them what they claim to be.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Maybe this is why world politics seem to stand still,</p>
      <p>why climate is not treated with the urgency it deserves.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Why deforestation is still an issue,</p>
      <p>why every large city has an atomic weapon pointed at it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>To fix politics,</p>
      <p>Humanity must grow beyond where it is today, and that process is actually very nice.</p>

      <p>Getting good at things on the personal,</p>
      <p>is quite a fantastic thing and always seems to come with a fancy feeling of accomplishment.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>On the personal level getting good is almost always about great adventure,</p>
      <p>and this is especially relevant for computer nerds from cyberspace that already hate it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Getting good, is nothing like endless hours of playing the piano,</p>
      <p>unless that is something that a person enjoys.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We have digital audio workstations now,</p>
      <p>we can make beautiful music without muscle memory, and we get to mess with thousands of instruments.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is hard to describe why seeing endless horizons,</p>
      <p>makes such a big difference.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But I think a lot of times,</p>
      <p>we forget how truly beautiful we are, and nature never fails to help us remember.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>One of the most magical things in the world of endless horizons,</p>
      <p>is room for listening to, or reading, books.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And books are vitamins for our mind,</p>
      <p>we cannot help but to return wiser, where endless horizons are concerned.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Getting good at things is not about laser vision,</p>
      <p>and not even about doing new things by subtle analogy to what we already know, not entirely.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is about bringing all the vastness of our Knowledge and Experience,</p>
      <p>to that one little thing that we were studying.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is a kind of wisdom,</p>
      <p>or perhaps it is wisdom.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>When we good at things,</p>
      <p>we grow.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And as people grow,</p>
      <p>Humanity Grows.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>To get good at things,</p>
      <p>is to help the world grow.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>This is what is meant when leaders say,</p>
      <p>do not ask what the world can do for you, ask what you can do for the world.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>What we can do for the world,</p>
      <p>is become wise, and that will absolutely make all the difference, in personal lives, in politics, and in all matters of concern.</p>
    </div>
