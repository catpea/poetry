      <p>My Friends, liars happen, because it is easiest to live on the low,</p>
      <p>and never rise, and just hide in the status quo.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>That's why we often run into a trouble maker,</p>
      <p>it takes no effort to be a faker.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Leave them, to their own stupid little prison,</p>
      <p>in their web of lies, there cannot be any reason.</p>

      <p>That's our first shaky step in life,</p>
      <p>to lean to see who's hiding a knife.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And then cutting with a sword,</p>
      <p>and setting ourselves free to move onward.</p>

      <p>I promise You, it gets better after this,</p>
      <p>the sun will rise, life will become bliss.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>With each step we take we find more light,</p>
      <p>and baby-step by baby-step, add to our might.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>It is as simple as the math of standing-still versus learning,</p>
      <p>one goes nowhere, and the other eventually fulfills all yearning.</p>

      <p>Walk Your path, don't let the fakers sway You,</p>
      <p>look them in the eyes, and see right through.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Choose the real over the fantasy they sell,</p>
      <p>and move away from their stupid little hell.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And if someone ever comes pushing You around,</p>
      <p>use the might of Your wisdom to push them back, and stand Your ground.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>There are so many sweet little treasures within You,</p>
      <p>the one You start with will show You heights You never knew.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>And the higher You rise the more brightly You will glow,</p>
      <p>and You'll find Your Sweetheart, before You know.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Life is meant to be lived in Wisdom and Happiness and Laughter,</p>
      <p>Heaven is Right Now - not in some fantasy of after.</p>

    <section>
      <p>All the things that are worthy of the Beautiful You,</p>
      <p>will never extract a toll, they will only ever add unto You.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Nobody worthy of You could ever make You feel sad or bad,</p>
      <p>they will foolishly trot and prance to Your rescue, until You feel glad.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Don't let fakers trick You into thinking the world is blue,</p>
      <p>The sun, is right over the next mountain, and is already shining for You.</p>
