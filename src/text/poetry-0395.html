    <div class="section">
      <p>I was digging in Eastern Europe,</p>
      <p>it was an old Airplane Field.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>There was a number of bunkers,</p>
      <p>and there was a house in the city that still had bullet holes in it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It was meant to be a reminder,</p>
      <p>of what the city walls used to look like.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>They were building a new apartment complex,</p>
      <p>in preparation for new infrastructure there was a new dig.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It was maybe four times my height,</p>
      <p>this was right at edge of the old air-field</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It was used as a land fill right after the war ended,</p>
      <p>or they were expanding it, by bringing rubble from another land-fill.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It was a rough day,</p>
      <p>I woke up early.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And set of for the dig site,</p>
      <p>I had plenty of time left before the work crew showed up.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>So, I focused on careful excavation of the site,</p>
      <p>layer by layer, artifact by artifact.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I found many bottles,</p>
      <p>some of them could have gone as far back as early 1800s, it seemed.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I found graphite sticks dating back to early 40s,</p>
      <p>these were likely of military origin, used in batteries to power portable equipment.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I hit a patch of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redware">Redware</a>,</p>
      <p>but it was hard to be sure, because of all the red shingles and crushed brick.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>As I was trying to make sense of what I had on this site,</p>
      <p>I remembered a kid from across the city with a jar of black power.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Crazy, son of a gun, was saying it was Trinitrotoluene,</p>
      <p>that he extracted from rusted armor piercing rounds, as in tank armor.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I hope he was wrong, and I hope is is OK,</p>
      <p>the only reason to have a deadly jar like that, is to try to light it later on, poor bastard.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Just last month, early March 2021, <a href="https://www.polishnews.co.uk/wroclaw-250-kg-bomb-detonated-at-the-training-ground-recording/">a 550 lb (or quarter ton). bomb was discovered</a>,</p>
      <p>over at Popowice, which wasn't that far away, it is no joke.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipVhWXVU_ts">The expert states that it was a Russian bomb of German manufacture, and says that they have a name for them "Rusty Death"</a>,</p>
      <p>and explains that the rust is only on the surface, the bomb is still an active explosive.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Search internet for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwVAuokrHrI">550-pound WWII bomb In Munich, 2012</a>,</p>
      <p>to see how enormous, and city shaking those explosions are - since these bombs cannot be moved, the only safe way to remove them, is to detonate them on purpose after evacuating the town.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You don't become an Archaeologist,</p>
      <p>Archaeology finds you, when it has something to say.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Then I saw it, it was a shiny colorful and beautiful round object,</p>
      <p>about the size of my hand.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It was a crystal, at first I thought the color came from it sitting in the ground,</p>
      <p>but now, I am certain, it was an iridescent crystal.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I brushed away the deep dark soil, and gasped,</p>
      <p>and just stood there holding it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It was a crystal snail,</p>
      <p>it was not some part of a expensive chandelier, it was a work of art that stood on its own.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I couldn't believe it,</p>
      <p>I found a treasure lost to history, it could be much much older than the dig site, a family heirloom, maybe.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But you know how it is,</p>
      <p>history will let you hold it, but it belongs to her.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>For the moment that I held it in my hand,</p>
      <p>it seemed like time has stopped.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But now, it begun flowing again,</p>
      <p>and almost like after a loud explosion, I regained my hearing, to discover I am being shouted at.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The workers, arrived a the site,</p>
      <p>they were packed in the bed of a huge dump truck that they used for moving the rubble as they dig.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>They were shouting because they saw a Nine Year old boy,</p>
      <p>by the flat wall of a deep hole, these walls have a tendency to collapse.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I still had to crawl out of there, it was still very deep for me,</p>
      <p>and the earth was really soft.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I threw my Crystal Snail up on top of the wall I had to climb,</p>
      <p>and as I made my way up there among all the shouting and the truck being really close,</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I lost site of it,</p>
      <p>and I searched for it courageously until the workers were right there.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But it was gone,</p>
      <p>I lost my magical treasure.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Post Scriptum,</p>
      <p>Here, I mark the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/51%C2%B007'34.0%22N+16%C2%B057'25.0%22E/@51.12611,16.9564088,177m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m14!1m7!3m6!1s0x470fea782aa2b505:0xf1a0f3fd873694e3!2sTa%C5%84skiego+17,+54-129+Wroc%C5%82aw,+Poland!3b1!8m2!3d51.125645!4d16.9578668!3m5!1s0x0:0x0!7e2!8m2!3d51.1261095!4d16.956956">location of my dig site</a>,</p>
      <p>and where I lost my magical crystal snail, 51°07'34.0"N 16°57'25.0"E, it could be beneath the sidewalk, but perhaps the hole I was in was the foundation for that six story building.</p>
