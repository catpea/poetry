    <div class="section">
      <p>I firmly believe we are each born a Scientist,</p>
      <p>when I was little - just as soon as I could scribble I begun writing a book entitled Kosmos.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And when the bullies came,</p>
      <p>I started a garden where I was hoping to make a crabcherryapplegrass tree, by splicing some random branches together, some of which might have been dead and dry.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And, I could say many awful words in different languages,</p>
      <p>and I remember the movie poster from which I slowly learned the f-word, like it was yesterday.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I use the f-word at least three times a week,</p>
      <p>and only to crow the worst divers, I am proud to know my words, I never mean ill will.</p>
    </div>

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Even though I never became a Professional,</p>
      <p>I always ignored people telling me that I can't do something.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Only once did I have a tiny little doubt,</p>
      <p>and this was about mathematics - but only lyke for a second - I quickly realized that everyone was just memorizing everything, and that was not learning.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>My expeditions are absolutely my greatest venture,</p>
      <p>not once in my whole life, did I ever go for a walk - like at all - it was always a challenging expedition.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And where I was cursed with but a short stretch of a road - which almost never happened,</p>
      <p>then I would take to philosophy and unsolved mysterious-mysteries.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <hr>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>For example, did you know that the big feet of the big foot,</p>
      <p>is just how the sun melts footprints in the snow, yup - I cracked that case too (though I am unwilling to admit how old I was.)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I still remember my most frightening mystery,</p>
      <p>it happened on a lonely hill, by a couple of trees I called rain makers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I was walking around the rim of a steep drop-off,</p>
      <p>got lured in by some fancy sticks, and possibly a small passage.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And all of a sudden I heard footsteps,</p>
      <p>and get this, footsteps all-a-freaking-round-me, everywhere.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It was like medieval warriors rushing to battle me,</p>
      <p>I had no idea what was going on.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It turned out to be deer,</p>
      <p>but it wasn't just any deer, they were huge, magnificent, majestic, movie deer, with huger antlers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>They didn't just frighten me,</p>
      <p>they also manged to make me feel ugly, somehow.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>But... not once did I skip an adventure,</p>
      <p>not once did I skip an expedition.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Not once did I forget to bring something I needed,</p>
      <p>I lived the life of a great explorer.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And a little scientist,</p>
      <p>for many years, if not decades I would celebrate New Years by writing a small but nice computer program.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I reached the height of my programming,</p>
      <p>when I got my early Sharp Zaurus SL-5500 and ended up writing bunch of cute little Perl scripts, without getting off the couch.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It is a little know fact that back in my Flash days,</p>
      <p>I was slowly becoming a generative artist, I remember creating a book of trees, it is a simple program with classy results.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I also created a book of shadows by automating Poser,</p>
      <p>a program that deal with human figures and shadow, it was a shadow reference book for artists.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Yes, these are all small experiments,</p>
      <p>but there were m,any of them, I built flimsy horses out of sticks and screws based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b694exl_oZo">Theo Jansen's Ideas</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I made so many miniature slingshots that to this day,</p>
      <p>I am still an expert at making them.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Teachers hated this,</p>
      <p>everyone hated this, always; but I never listened, not when I was little, not when I grew older.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Learning is what it is all about,</p>
      <p>we must never never give in.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You must never let the teachers scar you with grades,</p>
      <p>never let the bullies crush you, threats are always temporary, and they always pass.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Learning is forever,</p>
      <p>I said to myself this morning that I forgot more than I know - but that is a dumb thing to say - and I didn't quite meant to be serious.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You never forget what you learn,</p>
      <p>all the new stuff needs that other stuff to stand on top of.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Never stop learning,</p>
      <p>never let anyone stop you from learning.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Every new lesson is a new path,</p>
      <p>that will expand your universe.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We each have a Scientist, and an Artist, and an Inventor in our soul,</p>
      <p>and we can feel that the most when we are little, but then we must hand on to that, especially as we start growing up.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You never really become a grow up,</p>
      <p>it is just that you grow wiser, each day.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>No lesson is too foolish,</p>
      <p>no expedition too small.</p>
    </div>
