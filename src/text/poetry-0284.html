      <p>We have a tendency to take things for granted,</p>
      <p>and we hold many Cognitive Biases that can harm us.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>It is really important to question everything,</p>
      <p>all the Sciences were born this way.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>The sciences are a product of the Scientific Principle,</p>
      <p>a product of the search for truth by means of real evidence, clear thinking and healthy skepticism.</p>

      <p>Our world is changing very quickly,</p>
      <p>but almost all the major mistakes Humanity has made, are currently being repeated.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>The world has also become more interconnected,</p>
      <p>those born to one system of belief are now able to inspect other systems, onward to setting themselves free.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Beyond cults, many countries are attempting to warp reality, but that is also not possible anymore,</p>
      <p>all the fantasies that have been hammered into people are now becoming the cracks in the walls.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>There cannot be an army large enough to fight or even withstand reality,</p>
      <p>the harsh truth is that bringing fantasy into the real world is an act of self-destruction.</p>

      <p>All the fantasies and walls will fade, today's problem with borders and cults,</p>
      <p>is that they are a nuisance on our way to Knowledge, Wisdom, and Greatness.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>They delay our progress forward taking up precious decades,</p>
      <p>to delay the repairs our world needs, can only translate to contributing to all the suffering.</p>

      <p>We are infinite in our minds,</p>
      <p>just as soon as we notice and identify a problem, we instantly know how to out-think it.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Cults and Borders, are just one part of the problem,</p>
      <p>something has happened to Schools, and Universities they are not helping the world grow they way they should be.</p>

      <p>It may just be that lectures need to be personalized, instead of standardized,</p>
      <p>and the reward should not be seen as a nice job, but a company that the student can build with the knowledge they gain.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>This way the student will be likely to pick what is not only relevant but also meaningful and real for their business success,</p>
      <p>this will push back on semesters of lectures that that have no real impact on their life.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>And it is foolish to think that their quest for a stable business will not take them across all the sciences,</p>
      <p>the sciences call to everyone.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Personalized education doesn't really translate to never becoming aware of some subject,</p>
      <p>as this kind of education relies on worlds most beloved books.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Books as a whole provide a greater spectrum of subjects than that of lowest common denominator standardized education,</p>
      <p>and here while being exposed to new subjects, students learn the lessons they are ready to learn, and at a pace that is best for them, rather than being forces into useless memorization.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>We don't learn the way schools teach,</p>
      <p>we learn when we move from one curiosity to another, that motion is affected by what we already know, where we are and what we are doing on our life.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>By making education work for real, we lessen the complexity of the solutions to problems ahead,</p>
      <p>problems like money in politics, and mass incarceration, and poverty.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>A more knowledgeable world,</p>
      <p>is a more capable world.</p>
