      <p>A hole in the window curtain,</p>
      <p>lets a stray ray of light in.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>The light displays a blurry image,</p>
      <p>of what is outside, a pin hole camera.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>As the beam travels along the wall,</p>
      <p>he can imagine the entire solar system.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>He knows the planet spins and rotates,</p>
      <p>by inference from Jupiter Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>And now slowly the light,</p>
      <p>reaches an old crystal vase.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>There is a rainbow,</p>
      <p>the beam of light is unfurled.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>He's counting the colors,</p>
      <p>and a violin plays.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>And A becomes Blue,</p>
      <p>B is Indigo,</p>
      <p>C turns Violet,</p>
      <p>D is Red,</p>
      <p>E becomes Orange,</p>
      <p>F is Yellow,</p>
      <p>and G glows Green.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>He watched the whole thing,</p>
      <p>in bed, in silence.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>He knows now he will turn led to gold,</p>
      <p>let the Clockwork Universe, Unfold.</p>

      <p>You are so lucky that you live in an age where you can pull up,</p>
      <p>Newton's book on <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/33504/33504-h/33504-h.htm">opticks</a> with the click of a link.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>In most cases you can't be stopped by by research you have not yet conducted,</p>
      <p>and you don't have to invent much from scratch, you just need a science book.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>You have the same mental powers as Newton and all the others,</p>
      <p>but you DO, have to slow down, and think about things just like they did.</p>

      <p>Learning or catching up,</p>
      <p>is an Art.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Even though you have all the answers before you,</p>
      <p>you can't read it all at once.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>You have to follow one thread at a time,</p>
      <p>our minds need time to comprehend and rearrange.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Like the body of a dancer needs time to adapt,</p>
      <p>we have to learn at a precise pace, and sequence.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>It is very similar to learning the roads of a new city,</p>
      <p>you never say to your self I am not smart enough to navigate.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Because you never listen to confusing directions,</p>
      <p>you just follow a single road at your own pace and eventually master it.</p>

      <p>See, Newton learned from works of Galileo,</p>
      <p>who passed away the year Newton was born.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>And although Newton never did convert led to gold,</p>
      <p>the led of his pencil, became even more precious.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Many of Newton's works,</p>
      <p>must have fascinated Henry Cavendish.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>And Einstein no doubt appreciated the modes of thinking these men revealed,</p>
      <p>even though he never figured out his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFozGfxmi8A">Spooky Action at a Distance</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>They all learned much along the way,</p>
      <p>and each became wise for trying.</p>
