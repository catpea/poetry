Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Thirty Eight,<br>
My salads are working great!

I have lost even more weight,<br>
and I can't even count how many I ate.

It is a marvelous diet of incredible proportions,<br>
I don't track my calories, or even my portions.

I just make a salad once or twice,<br>
and with strawberry jam, it tastes like paradise.

And yes, I still continue improving and experimenting,<br>
Today, I added Jalapenos for a little spicy augmenting.

It is a strange magical thing,<br>
but Sugary Jam and Jalapenos are king.

It is not all sugar and spice, as yesterday I cried,<br>
I added and ate an whole onion so angry, I almost died.

So it is not just strawberry jam anymore,<br>
blueberry works just as well, maybe even more.

To all the diet people out there,<br>
join me in my venture,<br>
add a spoon jam,<br>
and taste the adventure.
