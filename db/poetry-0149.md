Life is always about learning and knowing,<br>
all those winds of change freely blowing.

But there is something you must always remember,<br>
that you are a **Raging Fire** not a glowing ember.

<br><br>

It is your **right** to **strive** and **thrive** and **grow**,<br>
may you **melt** all the sleeping-and-cold snow.

Let there fill new oceans, let the rivers flow,<br>
and may the sun shine forever with your beautiful glow.

<br><br>

We each should live our lives with a huge thunder,<br>
because no matter the tests life is always a wonder.

But the best things come from us beating life's test,<br>
by rising up, becoming wise, and doing our best.

<br><br>

No challenge is ever as easy as it looks,<br>
it all requires reading plenty of books.

I don't think anybody is ever truly blessed,<br>
I think life may push us all to feel stressed.

<br><br>

But we are each so special and so strong, and so sweet,<br>
that we can all take on the challenge, and handle the heat.

All the things we hold tight to the breast,<br>
always come from some hard challenge or quest.

<br><br>

It is **all** about learning and taking that harder route,<br>
so that each day we grow-more in wisdom and less in doubt.

So please, always strive to do your best,<br>
so that the 90 year old you can get some good night's rest.
