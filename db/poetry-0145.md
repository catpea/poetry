We are all very unique,<br>
and we are irreplaceable.

But the world is still growing,<br>
and it may neither fit not truly inspire you.

So you have to find out what really moves you,<br>
what makes you stand on unshakable ground.

Accepting the responsibility for your own education,<br>
you must become authentic and unbreakable.

You have to find what inspires you,<br>
and carry on, on that path.

Grow and develop and alter your course as fits you best,<br>
but make sure that each day adds to the previous.

<br><br>

Do not alter course for unimportant reasons,<br>
do not let strangers sway you.

Resist action without thought,<br>
and resist following orders without thinking.

Resist red faces, and screaming authority,<br>
and be careful because mistakes may try to sneak up on you.

<br><br>

Wisdom is not optional, it is the first and foremost,<br>
and it will protect you from making your greatest mistakes.

To grow up means to become a Great Being,<br>
in your Heart, Body, Mind, All of Your Pursuits, and Your Entire Life.

The path of growing up is built by inheriting wisdom,<br>
from those of past generations, who have made the same effort.

Please,<br>
take to all the books loved by Great Beings,<br>
and begin where they left off.
