Hey! whew,<br>
it's only eight,

and here I was worried,<br>
that I am going to be late.

Today is Friday,<br>
and on every Friday I must look,

for new ideas,<br>
to add to my fancy [Warrior Book](https://westland-valhalla.github.io/warrior/)

It is a book,<br>
made out of videos,

and some ideas,<br>
don't have enough of those.

<br><br>

Last week,<br>
I searched for "Ladies Fast Draw",

but it only returned three videos,<br>
last time I saw.

I also tried Women Sharp Shooting,<br>
and Compound Bow,

but something didn't fit,<br>
the chapter just didn't flow.

I am searching for<br>
inspirational things,

ideas that bring friends together,<br>
and give them wings.

<br><br>

I wrote that book to show all;<br>
that we all start slow,

but we can all become mighty,<br>
so as long as we give it a go.

All too frequently we assume,<br>
that we have to have talent.

and all the steps we take,<br>
must be naturally gallant.

But the truth is,<br>
that we must fail to get there,

effortlessly succeeding at anything,<br>
is as boring as rare.

No need to hurry,<br>
we can learn really slow,

the most important thing,<br>
is that we grow.
