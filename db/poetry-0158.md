Before we learn what we should know,<br>
we must first learn how to grow.

<br><br>

To break out of all the rooms and halls,<br>
we must destroy all the invisible walls.

As we cannot reason-about what we canâ€™t see,<br>
and so we must surpass our limits before we can think free.

<br><br>

It is not so much moving forward,<br>
as it is always growing upward.

We say forward when we seem to stop,<br>
but we mean up - up to the top.

And then rise above where our limits once stood,<br>
from could to would, to finally should.

<br><br>

What once we saw as highest complexity,<br>
we will know to navigate like a small city.

Then, we can help people finish their thoughts,<br>
help them to their stars, connect their dots.

<br><br>

We must learn, it is just how Human Beings are,<br>
we have to see the whole before we can find the star.
