Sure, racing my bicycle is nice late in the day,<br>
but at the end I have to use a flashlight to find my way.

Riding in the morning, the sun becomes so blinding halfway through,<br>
that I have to switch to sunglasses to continue enjoying the view.

<br><br>

Mornings have a whole different feel,<br>
empty streets and backwards sun make them all seem unreal.

That fresh fragrance full of chilled morning dew,<br>
now sunlit, creating a strange and mystical view.

This morning I saw a gigantic deer waking up in a grassy patch,<br>
and a hawk probably waiting around for her babies to hatch.

<br><br>

Dear reader, how about you?<br>
what do you love more, evening sunsets or the sunlit dew?
