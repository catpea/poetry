I know all too well that writing books is hard,
as far as I can tell; I am still learning English.

But books, share principles, with life,
be it book or life, it is always page after page, it has chapters.

Books are not, some fancy extra,
but a pretty fancy way of rising, just rising.

<br><br>

And perhaps it is somewhat old fashioned to be urging you to write books,
but I don't feel bad at all.

I expect the first one is the hardest,
the second one will be shoooo goood,

The third one - I am sorry,
will feel as floppy as a thinly sliced ham.

The fourth one,
after that long wonderful pause...

Will surely be the one,
it will feel like such a closure.

<br><br>

But listen,
I suspect that we don't really get started until our fifth book.

'Cause you know,
it is the book you don't think about writing that gets you.

<br><br>

...and, I think I can actually predict enough of it to say,
that as children we look to the future, as adults we grow, and as Great Beings we look at the past with wise eyes.

See, it is not until we get there, and glance over at ideas that we were passionate about when young...
...but now through the eyes of the Great Being... that all of a sudden, things like Amor Fati, are not merely about Love of Fate,

But also, from when we look at life,
see when looking back we see fate as something that that largely already unfolded.

And now, the love for it fits,
it is the love for all we've been through.

All the battles we fought and learned from regardless it it was triumph or disaster, ease or hardship,
it was what we grew **so profound**, what made us, ourselves.

<br><br>

So as long, as we fought to rise,
so as long as it counts for more than whim and being pushed around.

It doesn't matter how hard things were,
it matters that nothing took away from our Love of Life.

That we faced those challenges,
easy or difficult.

Because now,
you sit at the typewriter, and you know the story dot for dot.

See, we have to live our life so sturdily,
as to bring enlightenment to our Elder Selves, and perhaps make them cry a little - and why the heck not!

<br><br>

See, growing is not just for getting somewhere,
but also building what will eventually become our Beautiful Past.

And though as children we may need to admit to ourselves that we don't understand everything,
as Great Beings come Our Golden Age, we will understand what we once struggled with.

And with a great sense of accomplishment,
a sense of accomplishment that wouldn't be there, had we not challenged ourselves with things that were out of our grasp when we were young.

So what may seem as difficulty in our youth,
we will end up loving in our Golden Age for making us stronger and more profound.
