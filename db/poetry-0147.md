I know all too well that writing books is hard,
as far as I can tell; I am still learning English.

And perhaps it is somewhat old fashioned to be urging you to write books,
but I don't feel bad at all.

I expect the first one is the hardest,
the second one will be shoooo goood,

The third one - I am sorry,
will feel as floppy as a thinly sliced ham.

The fourth one,
after that long wonderful pause...

Will surely be the one,
it will feel like such a closure.

<br><br>

But listen,
I suspect that we don't really get started until our fifth book.

'Cause you know,
it is the one you don't know about that gets you.

I hope it does not go as far as making your previous books feel like an introduction,
to this new magnificent rrrrrrrr.

<br><br>

I think I can actually predict enough of it to say,
that as children we look to the future, as adults we grow, and as Great Beings we look at the past.

See, it is not until we get there,
and glance over at ideas that we were passionate about as young, but now through the eyes of the Great Being...

...that all of a sudden, things like Amor Fati, are not merely about Love, and Fate, and Love of Fate,
see when looking back we see fate as something that that largely already occurred.

And now, the love for it fits, it is the love for all we've been through,
all the battles we fought and learned from, that we grew **so profound** from.

So as long, as we fought to rise,
so as long as it counts more than whim and being pushed around.

It doesn't matter how hard things were,
it matters that nothing took away from our Love of Life.

That we faced those challenges,
easy or difficult.

Because now,
we sit at the typewriter, and we know the story dot for dot.

See, we have to live our life so sturdily,
as to bring enlightenment to our Elder Selves.

Make them smirk and smile,
and god damn it, make them think twice about wishing to be young again.

I just wanted to let you know,
about your The Fifth Book.
