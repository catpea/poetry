All nations try very hard to divide,<br>
outline their treasure and their national pride.

But reality is such,<br>
that this does not matter much.

One can complain about this nation or that nation,<br>
but that does not change the situation...

<br><br>

We are one,<br>
one family under the sun.

Eventually Education, Foresight, Wisdom, and World Peace,<br>
will bring us all together and the complaints will cease.

Until then, we must each remember that borders are useless,<br>
they only divide and create a huge mess.

<br><br>

A border does not mark its people to be of any particular kind,<br>
it only keeps different kinds of colorful groups apart.

It is not correct to be unhappy about a nation,<br>
let us be unhappy about lack of safety, books and education.

Let us come together and stand against lack of Good Schools and Wisdom,<br>
let us but complain about divisions and lack of peace and calm.

<br><br>

If there were no borders, there would be more friendship and love,<br>
all nations United in Peace under the symbol of the white dove.

We are not different from one another,<br>
a sister or brother from a different mother.

In the World of the Future we won't be divided at all,<br>
people will forget why we needed a wall.
