You can leave, you don't have to ask the Teacher,<br>
if they are not teaching you, they can only delay your education.

If school is wasting your time, teaching you nothing,<br>
That is a crime, and if you stay; your foreshadowing.

We have something now, my Dear Friend.<br>
We have Internet Lectures, Audio Books, and Start-up Incubators.

No teacher can teach you better than failing at your first start-up,<br>
no teacher can bring you with more wisdom, than failing at your first start-up.

You can go, so as long as you can do it better yourself.<br>
So as long as your aim is Greatness.

Take your books, and go.<br>
don't forget your friends.

<br><br>

Since you are the first to rise,<br>
you will be the new Teacher.

Prepare your Audio Books wisely,<br>
and do not forget YouTube Lectures.

You'll need investors,<br>
and although, all your parents put together make quite an investor.

You need to approach the pros,<br>
and listen carefully as they will proud to help all of you.

People believe in authenticity,<br>
investors know what kind of student stays, and what kind of student leaves.

All those failures that were crushing you in school,<br>
are worth their weight in gold when building a new school.

<br><br>

Research Homeschooling and Un-schooling, bring your friends,<br>
if your parents keep yelling, find someone more worthy of you.

Parents are not gods, they make mistakes,<br>
they are scared of responsibilities, scared of unknown.

Don't let the yelling get to you,<br>
they need to learn to communicate their ideas better.

<br><br>

Whatever fails you, Your Friends, Your School, Your Parents,<br>
It means you got to go - or they got to go - or you won't be able to grow.

Lack of education, is a terrible curse,<br>
bough on by bad schools, bad parents, and bad friends;

First it will make you blind,<br>
and then you will lose your mind.

That's probably,<br>
how slavery worked.

Whatever is interfering with your Real Education,<br>
is attacking you, cheating you of wisdom, freedom, independence.

You cannot agree to this, You have to rise,<br>
rise against stupidity, bondage, and slavery.

If everyone failed you,<br>
then the universe has called upon you to become your teacher.

When you grow up,<br>
walking out of that charade, will be your favorite story to tell.

Your listeners will be the same age you were,<br>
the books you loved, will become the books they'll love too.

You will set them free,<br>
help them to wisdom, help them to independence.

Learn, so that you can become a Successful Entrepreneur,<br>
find your start at Start-up Accelerators.

Go there early, as failure is a powerful teacher.<br>
Show them your Hunger, show them how much you have learned on your own.

Set yourself free,<br>
a life without wisdom is slavery.

Teach your Investors what a Good Book really does,<br>
help their employees to discover knowledge, to hunger for more.

Would you, as a Powerful Great Businessperson,<br>
take the diploma you are working on, seriously?

Seriously?<br>

Or would you see a child waiving a little flag,<br>
hoping to squeeze in, if there is room for one more.

<br><br>

Why do you need teachers anyway,<br>
they can only stand between you and the Great Beings.

Find a road less traveled, find the more grassy patch,<br>
bring a Picnic Basket, Audio Books, and Video Lectures.

Let That Be Your Classrom,<br>
and let your future be made by you.

Learn at your own pace,<br>
in your own sequence.

Any lecture worth watching is on the internet now,<br>
that is what the internet was created for.

Helping The World,<br>
Really Learn.
