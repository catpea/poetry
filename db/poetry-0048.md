[Listen](audio/poetry-0048.mp3)

Did you know, that we can't grow,<br>
unless our lessons connect together?<br>
We learn the way we navigate cities.

If we leap from one city center, to another...<br>
we will not know, where to go, or what to do.<br>
None of the roads will make any sense.

To divide knowledge into subjects,<br>
and encourage cramming, and memorization,<br>
and force remembering over understanding.

That is not Education, or Knowledge.<br>
We can no more leap between subjects,<br>
than hobbies, or families.

What connects two things together,<br>
is as important as the things themselves.

We only learn when two connect,<br>
and, then the two connect to a third one,<br>
and next one, to no end.

We need a pleasant memorable,<br>
unbroken chain of curiosities,<br>
that we can slide up and down, when need be.

Disconnected snippets,<br>
that we not know what to do with,<br>
are not useful to us.
