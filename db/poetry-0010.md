Captain's Log: Eighth day of the quarantine. I have extended the Sciurine Instrumental Section with a Beautiful Thin Saw (a Sciurine Favorite) and a powerful Electric Cello backing a [Tree Trunk](https://github.com/Tonejs/Presets/blob/gh-pages/instrument/Synth/TreeTrunk.json) Synth. As nothing like this has ever been heard on Planet Earth before, the song has risen all the way to the very top of Shire Lyre Squire Squirrel Choir charts and is expected to stay there permanently, forever.
