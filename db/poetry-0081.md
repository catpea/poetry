Philosophy, and her Daughters the Sciences, are a way to put ourselves to words,<br>
they are a means of storage, transfer, and communication.

Philosophy is a thin outer layer of the Human Mind,<br>
of the Human Condition, of the Raw, Unleashed, Human Consciousness.

Within, Rises The Human,<br>
The Source of Raw.

<br><br>

The only flaw,<br>
is us becoming convinced we are small.

That's why we have each other,<br>
I remind you, you remind your granddaughter, she reminds those in need.

<br><br>

And the Triumph continues,<br>
The Triumph, is an unbroken line through the past.

Like an eraser it runs over nations that take freedom,<br>
wiping out corrupt politicians for the specks of dust they are.

It a bone shaking scream it runs through the blind judge,<br>
it strikes nightmares in those who treat men as animal.

It pierces the hearts of animals that recruit unprepared kids to teach them how to become "men" in war,<br>
it carves, the predatory weapon manufactures that turned air to acid for a profit.

It strikes right through the slavers burning them to dust,<br>
the lawless beg in their last moments as the village heroes rise.

And the wolves run and hide under our very own blankets,<br>
made of the snarling bear skins from last week.

<br><br>

History of the Human Kind,<br>
will always be writ and washed by prevalent powers.

But that will always be a surface story,<br>
because in the face of the future the truth is always revealed.

You are easily capable of becoming countless times more,<br>
than the heroes described in the books.

By subtle analogy to whatever our triumphs are,<br>
we can see all the other triumphs for what they really were.

By the very power that expands our wisdom,<br>
we grow to no end.
