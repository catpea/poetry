Take two steps forward,<br>
and one step back, Jack.

Jogging is an art,<br>
and for art you must be smart.

For each two days of training,<br>
on the third you must pretend it's raining.

If you you can't make it rain,<br>
always worrying about your gain;

then walking is just fine,<br>
But, never cross that little line.

The third day is a day of rest,<br>
and the fourth your next test.

Because, you always have to go back,<br>
and start anew to lay down your track.
