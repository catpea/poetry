Not Until This, Not Until That<br>
Don't let anybody push you around,

If you allow negativity towards you for long enough,<br>
it will make you very ill.

Tolerance of negativity will push you to cross lines,<br>
it will derail you the same way that lies derail liars.

It is like the lines that addicts cross,<br>
until there is no way to come back.



Take a look into the mind of the person negative towards you,<br>
do they even see you as a person?

If their ultimate aim is not to rob you of yourself to turn you into a tool,<br>
then are you not some disposable mean to their shortcuts.

Nothing is found in servitude, it won't make you stronger,<br>
it won't make you nobler, or enlightened, or worthy.

Protect your mind, reject being pushed around,<br>
stand up, rise, do not follow, no one has any control over you.



You become Stronger when you rise,<br>
when you put your feet down on the ground, and push up - to the mountains.

You become Nobler when you break away,<br>
when you let go of those ahead of you, and take your own path to the side.

You become Wise and Enlightened when you stand your ground Memoirs in hand,<br>
when you learn from the lessons on your own path, and by subtle analogy to other paths.

You become Worthy, of Yourself, of Love, of Wisdom, of a house you can call Home,<br>
when you grow protecting who you are, onward to becoming the best You.



Do not be scared, because if you stay scared, nothing will change,<br>
do not let sadness keep you in bed, go to the library first.

Do not let the sick thick stickiness to keep you bound,<br>
most of it is illusion, including the few pleasures you found.

Do net let alligator tears, and hollow souls void of any content howl you back,<br>
you are not part of that world, you never were.

Do not go slowly wandering down their own paths, that's how _they_ were created,<br>
and you can still reject that agony and become free.



Look to the best within you, your Beautiful Treasures,<br>
your Innocence, your Sweetness, your Love, your Cuteness, your Generosity, your Might, your Endurance.

Those are powerful treasures meant to help you become a Great Being,<br>
treasures that they have forsaken in their own selves.

Now they are trying to forsaken your own treasures, to fuhrer the dark path they dig,<br>
do not let them take what is irreplaceable within you.

You cannot aid them in any way, that can only feed their evil,<br>
and take away from your Beautiful Treasures.



Let the world see you, read at the Library, visit Museums and Art Galleries,<br>
go see someone singing with their beautiful voice.

Write in your journal, record on your phone, sharpen your pencil,<br>
use tracing paper to learn how to draw.

Step after step courageously walk down the isles to get your first air dry clay,<br>
and sculpt, sculpt your world, and touch, and feeling, show the world.

Do not hide, reject the bad, and shine among the crowds,<br>
do not let your older-self cry that you were never seen.
