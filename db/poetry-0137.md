First of All,

Let me share with you a secret to a great intellectual wealth,<br>
if you ever get hurt, or lonely the Audio Books will completely restore your health.

They will help you understand the world a lot better,<br>
and they will piece your heart right back together.

Audio books will make your heart whole,<br>
and they will add great Wisdom and Strength to your Soul.

<br><br>

And Let Me Tell You,

They help us resume great works and understand great lives,<br>
connect with great beings, their minds, and drives.

And it really, really works, they help you inherit power,<br>
it gets into your soul, and grows like a flower.

And they help us see better with our own eyes,<br>
see World Poverty as the enemy, and World Peace as the The Prize.

<br><br>

And the more lives you inherit from,<br>
the sooner, you will find your way Home.

The original way, we used to learn to rise higher,<br>
**was** by listening to Moving Stories by a cracking fire.

By listening to all the world's great stories we push poverty away,<br>
and we become Wiser to no end, each and every day.
