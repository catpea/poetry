If you grant me, that growing up is more than mere aging,<br>
and that the other component is Intellectual Development.

And if we agree that we each start near zero,<br>
and carry on upwards eventually becoming unique and creating undiscovered paths.

And if we agree that this idea cannot be used to belittle people,<br>
it can only be used for growing up, and towards Humanity's Noblest goals.


Then,<br>
there is something you should know.


You can't speak to all people who are still developing on different heights and in different paths,<br>
not in the same language, and each unique height will carry unique concepts that can't translate.

While we share a lot,<br>
we don't share enough to communicate in ways that help us converge towards Wisdom.

There cannot be a single language with shared deeply held beliefs,<br>
on subjects that relate to progressing forward or upward.


Each,<br>
must learn to translate, interpret and understand the other.


The speakers who who speak only on their own intellectual level,<br>
and from within their own culture are not enough to help the world grow.

Nor will there ever be a single mountain peak where we all converge,<br>
there can only be a certain height that will help cultures understand each other.

But, we do share the act of rising up, of growing up towards Wisdom,<br>
of standing in relentless pursuits of excellence.

And,<br>
of helping each other so that we may grow in Peace.
