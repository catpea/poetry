Your superpowers are not rooted in your wishes,
as only very few wishes come true.

Universe has already established its rule and order,<br>
we are latecomers to the symphony orchestra.

Instead, seek your superpowers in what you already own,<br>
in the things that have already sprung.


In the incredible adaptability of your body,<br>
in your raw, unleashed consciousness.

If you are good to your body, you body will flourish,<br>
it is a biological system, not that different from a flower.

If you are good to your mind, it will expand,<br>
it is a navigational system with landmarks.

Your mind is especially beautiful,<br>
it has a large memory capacity.

You can't recall letters on a particular page in a book,<br>
but you can recall the walls in your home, the streets in your city.

Your mind does not differentiate between navigating a road,<br>
or a vast galaxy of star constellations.

Your mind can encode interconnected knowledge,<br>
so as long as it is marked with pictures and relative locations on a well connected tree.

<br><br>

It is foolish to think to a particular page,<br>
and feel ordinary for not being able to recall all the words.

It is foolish to try to ride a boat,<br>
on a road.

<br><br>

Do not seek to invent your superpowers,<br>
instead, recognize the once you already have and expand them.
