[Listen](audio/poetry-0095.mp3)

It is a pretty dark trick,<br>
and it makes life run out all too quick.

If all were to be tricked to break the link,<br>
that they can't climb on giants to think;

And all became mere muscle and bone,<br>
humanity would fade in vain, with a deathly moan.

<br><br>

We have to remind each other, so that we don't forget,<br>
or we will fade, without feeling a hint of regret.

You are meant to become a Great Being,<br>
you are finely crafted for the Art of Seeing.

With your unstoppable sight,<br>
as your greatest might...

You can understand anything,<br>
and rise higher than any king,<br>
it is your right!

<br><br>

You are meant to rise, at least to the status of a Hero,<br>
keep people from running themselves into a zero.

That power is in each and every one of us,<br>
and we must be Noble and Wise,<br>
so that no one can stop us.

Know with certainty that it is always Spring Season,<br>
to stand up for Truth & Reason.

Know that Truth and Beauty is always right,<br>
and yours, is that Power and Might.
