We have an aversion to being trapped,<br>
because of an innate sense of distance that we must travel.

The distance begins the moment we gain self-awareness,<br>
the end, does not matter - only the distance does.

<br><br>

You are in charge of the direction of your journey,<br>
if you let it lead you, it will pull you in all directions.

In letting the life dictate,<br>
you will become divided.

<br><br>

In doing the dictating,<br>
you, will set the aim.

If you let yourself become a leader,<br>
you will arrive at a singe destination.

<br><br>

In one way, or another,<br>
you will, without a doubt, arrive.

The Universe, cannot stop what you start,<br>
the Universe will gently let your existence expand.

<br><br>

It is tough to be led and expect clarity,<br>
there will be too much noise from following.

But in leading, there is no noise,<br>
the path is pure, as pure as your imagination.

<br><br>

The steps along your journey,<br>
extract a price.

The Universe smiles,<br>
as you pay your way.

<br><br>

You start as a child,<br>
and the first step is very difficult.

And the second, and fourth grade,<br>
and sixth semester, and eighth book.

<br><br>

Your singular ripple,<br>
unlike everything else out in the Universe;

Has a breathtaking order dictated from within,<br>
not pushed by the chaos, but dictated by your mind.

<br><br>

Can you imagine how boring chaos becomes,<br>
and can you see how beautiful your perfect ripple.

The edge of chaos that surrounds your beauty,<br>
is pushed out by a kind, of Youniverse.

<br><br>

Let me be clear,<br>
you are not a river, nor a snowball, or a butterfly's wing.

There is enough of those, already,<br>
nothing worthy of you, needs you to follow.

<br><br>

It is a Law of The Universe,<br>
that no Human should follow.

A river should flows surely to the sea,<br>
but a Human, is meant to Lead.

<br><br>

It is a simple but forgotten lesson,<br>
it is meant to sit next to; Love of Wisdom.

That no human should serve nor follow,<br>
non should practice resignation.

<br><br>

If you feel weak,<br>
it is because you resigned for too long.

And you will have to start in the beginning,<br>
and your first step will be very difficult.
