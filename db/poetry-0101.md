To slowly turn your life, into Art,<br>
small, is the best way to start.

Small means but tiny discomfort,<br>
at first, make your adventures very short.

You don't have to go out, all the way,<br>
let the sky, mountains, and sea invite you out to play.

And the call rarely ever comes from something big,<br>
it will be more like a fragrant breeze, or muddy shoes, or the snap of a twig.

Before you know it, you'll be packing up for Nordhouse Dunes,<br>
hoping to be the first to greet all the Fancy Raccoons.
