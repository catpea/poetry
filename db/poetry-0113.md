You know me, I am not one to complain,<br>
but; every once in a while a little bird flies into my jogging lane.

She lands, and turns her head to look at me,<br>
the moment she sees that I see...

...she starts hopping, moving **much** faster than me,<br>
at first I thought she was trying to raise me as her baby.

But now I think she's only doing this, to mock me,<br>
she's just sick of seeing me struggle from her tree.

For one, when she's done racing me,<br>
she stops and just stares angrily.

Then she always takes off for my face,<br>
it is really hard to duck when you are trying to focus on your pace.

I have a theory as to why she flies at me this way,<br>
though I am afraid to say,

Umm...

Some of the flies that catch me when I leave my yard,<br>
you know, those little ones that are always trying to lick so hard.

Even after several miles... they kind of keep my pace,<br>
kind of actually run circles around my face.

While, I bring most of the flies back,<br>
the bird probably flies at me like this, to grab a snack.

Well,

I am now trying really hard to improve my pace,<br>
to get all those creatures out of my face.

I run fast just as soon as I get out of my home.<br>
maybe if I can outrun the flies the bird will leave me alone.
