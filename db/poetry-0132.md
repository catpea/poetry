[Listen](audio/poetry-0132.mp3)

I always try hard to learn something new,<br>
so that my elder self can mumble "I grew."

I try to listen to a non-fiction book or two,<br>
to update my general world view.

<br><br>

And I do computer programming and research too,<br>
I have lots of bookmarks in my queue.

I am trying to write programs as if I had a crew,<br>
so I stick to simple systems where I can think things through.

<br><br>

Learning Life, and Programming somehow fits me like a shoe,<br>
I'll have to make a list of the books and papers I read through.

I never have to try to look for something new,<br>
there are too many beautiful things to get bored, or blue.

<br><br>

I like learning about things that are most Human and true,<br>
trying to figure our what our elder selves wished they knew.

Someday, I would like to write a book to help young people get a better world view,<br>
something short and beautiful that they can quickly finish, slam shut, and say "Who knew?"
