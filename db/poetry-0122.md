To rise, to become strong, to grow and to break away and become more authentic,<br>
is our first great responsibility, and our health.

However, it does go against our nature as children,<br>
we have a tendency not to look outside of the culture we are brought into.

Rite of Passage is about crossing that line,<br>
the line between The Child That Follows, and The Adult That Leads.

The moment we can handle looking at ourselves and our culture,<br>
from the **outside** in, we begin crossing the line into adulthood.

<br><br>

One of the first few thoughts may be, "But what if I was born into a different religion?"<br>
followed by, "What if I was not born into this economic class, into this poverty?".

As these questions grow from asking about ourselves, to also including others,<br>
they bring us insight into the greater Human Condition.

Bring us to the question of The Freedom of Will, of how much our Personality is Our Own,<br>
of internal decision making heavily influenced by external culture or placement.

As we grow we begin asking even greater questions about others,<br>
"Would the petty thief stole, had he **not** been fractured by the virus of poverty?"

Our minds begin scanning for solutions that aim towards a Greater Good,<br>
towards Word Peace, International Convergence on Wisdom, Unites States of The World.

We begin seeing that although there isn't an answer to every question,<br>
there are Dreams that could prevent the worst of World's Mistakes.

<br><br>

Building schools to help a culture grow,<br>
instead of forecasting war and manufacturing enough weapons.

Preventing the existence of criminals,<br>
by helping little children to Happy Homes, and to a Universal Basic Income.

Trading simple schools and grades for Business Success,<br>
helping children to become Well Funded Entrepreneurs and Investors.

<br><br>

No matter which questions we begin with and how our path is arranged,<br>
we discover how critical Growing Up is, for us, for eveyone.

How much more we are,<br>
than mere followers of the rules that we are born to.

How important to our mental health,<br>
it is not to fall a victim to bad ideas or fractures of poverty.

Our First Great Act in life is lifting ourselves above the culture we are born into,<br>
that is the meaning of the words Rising, Growing Up, Breaking Away, Becoming Stronger.

<br><br>

And the acts of independent thinking that are sure to follow,<br>
are the very foundation of Our Hope in a Better Future.

Have no fear of Rising, of Breaking Away, of Growing Up, of Growing In Strength,<br>
for that is Adulthood, and none can stay children for long.

Close your eyes, and begin building,<br>
because your next step is to become a Great Being.
