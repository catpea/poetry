Captain's Log, Quarantine Fiveever, Day Twenty Three.

It was a super busy day, not a moment for tea.

And I keep Programming late into the night,

typing like a Lion with all his might.

This morn, I woke up and made Peanut Butter and Jelly,

I've been programming all day, I keep going like the telly.

Now, I am trying to figure out, a datatype for verse,

my stanza CSS padding and margins are intense.

I am not trying to be a hero, hey!

but I am writing this, in a [JavaScript Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)!

I don't know if there is anymore I can say,

other than that I am OK,

and that this has been an OK day.

No wait, I'll add this:

I wish everyone pure bliss!
