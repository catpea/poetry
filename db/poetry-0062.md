If everyone seems scary,<br>
that's only because scary is all you've ever met.

I've met them too, I saw what they can do.<br>
How sure of themselves, how forward and blind.

But, if you spend your life in hiding,<br>
they will win, and rob you of everything precious.

So rise, begin taking care of yourself,<br>
and begin your search.

Not a search for mere friends,<br>
but a search for The Extraordinary.

<br><br>

It is simple.<br>
My friends.

The only way to find The Extraordinary,<br>
is to become Extraordinary yourself.

<br><br>

If you got hurt before,<br>
then you have already come a long way.

You now hold a gift of Wisdom,<br>
a Foresight that can spare suffering.

No one is to take Love of Life from you,<br>
no one is to rob you of Joy and Laughter.
