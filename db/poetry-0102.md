[Listen](audio/poetry-0102.mp3)

We are too good, at working too hard,<br>
this is why we must stay on guard.

Your mind is more than just a tool,<br>
it is a rare and beautiful jewel.

Many hope that you will never know,<br>
that your generation is the new new hope, for the world to grow.

But, if we just close our eyes and let mistakes repeat,<br>
the world will fade away in silent defeat.

Go, take to adventure, pack, and get into you car,<br>
so that you will never forget who you really are.
