I went bicycling today,<br>
but I was lost in thoughts all day.

<br><br>

I thought about Typography and Art,<br>
and how evey Human Being is really smart.

How people get busy,<br>
and how life is rarely easy.

How we get tired, how creativity is made,<br>
otherwise it will just fade.

How there is only ever time for big things,<br>
it matters not if its vagabonds or kings.

We are all limited in time,<br>
we truly are meant to learn, become wise and climb.

<br><br>

Now, I am ready for bed,<br>
I really feel tired.

I am already packed for my morning run,<br>
the weather says, no rain, only sun.

Though, I've noticed it will snow,<br>
at the Rocky Mountains... but that's good to know.

Because you can't ever be too far away from that,<br>
I am pretty far away, and glad.
