With each little triumph, we add to our treasures,<br>
and it grows over time, it grows beyond measures.

Sometimes, it all starts in loneliness,<br>
but it quickly fills up as it reaches silliness.

And so, we carry our fancy treasure chest,<br>
we take it with us on every quest.

It is not possible for it to get lost,<br>
and nobody else can touch it - at any cost.

In no way could it ever be sacrificed,<br>
and no robbers could ever stage a big enough heist.

<br><br>

Little chest in a safe place deep in out heart,<br>
it serves to light the fire that fuels our art.

It prevents us from walking in reverse,<br>
it helps to make our existence more diverse.

It also adds a great deal unto our beauty,<br>
as it drives us to create out of love, and not mere duty.

All those petite little things that make us proud,<br>
also make us stand out in a crowd.

So it also serves as a lighthouse with a bright beam<br>
that lights the way betwixt us, and our dream.

<br><br>

I think one reason why nobody ever mentions it,<br>
is because it is too sacred, to just talk about it.

But I want to remind you, my Dear Friends,<br>
that sometimes we need to look through this lens.

Your treasure chest will show you,<br>
a picture of you that is most true.

<br><br>

Oh, don't worry if you have only one thing,<br>
it is still a treasure, it still makes you a Queen or King.

We all have a few simple treasures when we start,<br>
but they grow as we use our heart to turn our life to art.
