Universe created Evolution, Evolution created Consciousness,<br>
Consciousness created Humans, and Humans created Philosophy.

The word Philosophy, comes from the greek Philosophia,<br>
it means Love of Wisdom.

It comes from the time when Great Beings first begun emerging among us,<br>
they rejected inauthenticity, violence, contradiction, and imaginary things and creatures.

These were the First Superheroes,<br>
they were often attacked.

![Socrates](image/poetry-0079-socrates.jpg)

This is Socrates, he taught the children power of Wisdom,<br>
he was sentenced to death, and he did not run, he died, for Wisdom.

Wisdom is self correcting,<br>
it eventually went against the State and its imaginary gods, and so the State went against him.

He outlived the State by becoming immortal,<br>
he is often seen as the Father of Philosophy, but there were many other thinkers.

![Hepatia](image/poetry-0079-hepatia.jpg)

This is Hepatia, her tragedy, marks the end of the first Philosophers,<br>
the world plunged into Dark Ages.

As hard earned as Wisdom is, as long as it takes to cultivate and grow,<br>
the criminals can take it away in a cold flash of steel.

Her tragedy, should not be forgotten, the Noblest become a target,<br>
to the fractured, and blind, and jealous.

For now, Wisdom is no longer seen as the Highest there is,<br>
today, opinion seems to matter as much as fact.

There are calls to "teach controversy", for "equal debate",<br>
to "show both sides", to "let the reader decide".

Falsely presenting a broken opinion,<br>
to be on par with the reality and fact that helps Humanity Grow.

It is an old trick, it is cheap, and self assembling,<br>
it emerges on its own from poverty, inequality, suffering, blindness, and pain.

Being conscious and self aware, is not quite enough,<br>
because of Liars, Thieves, Criminals, Murderers, War, and even Poverty.

Wisdom is like a higher level Operating System for Humans,<br>
it enhances our consciousness, it grants us unique powers.

But, Every Human, each member of the Grand Human Family,<br>
needs to see Wisdom as a necessity.

Until then, racism, xenophobia, inequality, poverty, and darkness,<br>
will keep us apart.

![Soldier](image/poetry-0079-soldier.jpg)

The Stories of Superheroes are rooted in lives of Philosophers,<br>
because a Philosopher cannot be hurt like the ordinary men.

Philosophers survive for thousands of years in text,<br>
in stories, in paintings.

They survive by sharing Wisdom,<br>
that make us stronger, that enriches us, that we each yearn for.

When you read the words of a philosopher,<br>
she or he comes round, and in a way they keep you company.

Socrates knew that,<br>
and he knew he needs to send a powerful message far into the future.

An important being, died for something important,<br>
he is signaling, that Wisdom is Your Right.

He was a Soldier,<br>
he found a way to repair the word.

And it was,<br>
Love of Wisdom.

Once you begun paying attention to it all,<br>
a constellation of stars will begin assembling in you.

Each star will repair and strengthen all the others,<br>
it will bring you health and clarity.

Your contradictions will begin resolving,<br>
by rejecting and ejecting that which makes no sense.

It will help your decision making,<br>
it won't let you move forward when two things oppose.

It will keep you in place,<br>
until you reject the one that is not fact.

Where all the other stalks fracture,<br>
Wisdom will help you bend in the colder winds of change.

Foresight helps you combine knowledge,<br>
to construct events that are yet to unfold.

Moreover, it helps you construct the correct path ahead,<br>
and reject whatever else may come.

The Power of Foresight does not end with the individual wielding it,<br>
it can extend to guiding the word to the correct its paths.

Heroism is in part is about learning what not to do,<br>
helping others requires solving their problems, and thus you learn life.

But the greatest of insights are found in Memoirs worth reading,<br>
where they are placed in correct context.

With enough insight Crime for example, transforms from an impenetrable state of mind that it is,<br>
to our need to create Walls of Prevention, so that people don't end up blind.

Punishment and Revenge is not a way to treat a Human Being fractured by poverty,<br>
or violence, or even hunger-for-food. Only prevention can work here.

The power of insight shows you that while you can't go back in time,<br>
you can prevent the little ones from ending up in the same place.

In that way, you take the pain of those Punished and use it for a thing that matters,<br>
preventing children from following in their footsteps.

![Martorano](image/poetry-0079-martorano.jpg)

And we get to feel others,<br>
we get to feel when they have been Wronged.

And we get to feel what they felt, when times got tough,<br>
and the power of Compassion makes us a Family.

Who was it that gave [George Martorano][1] that little pencil,<br>
power of compassion is incredibly complex.

You hold hands with every wronged being on Earth,<br>
those looking to their Favorite Star, wondering if someone else is looking there too.

We are, we all are, we are there with you,<br>
You matter, your heart mattes, your mind matters, your life matters.

And in Wisdom we will fix all of it,<br>
whether we are ready to recognize that or not, we are a Family, and as One, We'll fix it all.

In that path we slowly walk together,<br>
towards Happiness and Fairness, and Joy.

We will erase poverty and slavery with Universal Income and a Free Home with a picket fence.<br>
We will erase crime with Care and Prevention, and Fairness.

We will erase war, blindness and stupidity, with Family Love and Wisdom.<br>
We will erase all problems that plague the Human Family, it is what a family does.

One day, the world will stand united in fact,<br>
as opposed to being divided by opinion.

Not even the Universe can stand in our way,<br>
our way is the Human Family Way.

Like Wisdom,<br>
we are Unstoppable.
