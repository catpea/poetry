Our minds constantly construct boundaries,<br>
and constantly try to make us comfortable.

But in an evolved world this works against us,<br>
it creates boundaries across which we hope to discharge pain.

The source of the pain is poverty, poverty of mind and wallet,<br>
fear, pain, unfairness and inequality, add to the blindness.

There is no solution on the level where poverty reins,<br>
it will always be walls turning people against each other.

We are not ready for the next level,<br>
in the next level we recognize poverty as a virus.

We see it as a Natural Disaster,<br>
we sit back, relax, calm down, print enough money to end it and move on.

This does not mean everyone is going to be rich,<br>
it only means, nobody will be stuck in financial poverty.

Poverty of mind, the other half of poverty is not even up for discussion,<br>
not until everyone has a safe home.

All of this seems impossible, to many laughable,<br>
irrational, infantile, unfair even.

For those of you who don't understand how someone could possibly call this unfair,<br>
some will angrily yell "Why should someone get a free home, when I worked for mine, my entire life?".

<br><br>

This is the Nature of the Walls,<br>
the picture of the great divide.

A divide between who we are today,<br>
and who we should be tomorrow.

<br><br>

A Human Being is so special,<br>
that they may not exist without their own Home, not just a house.

So special, that active countermeasures must be put in place,<br>
to help people move away from bad ideas.

A Human Being is so special, that they must never grow up in fear,<br>
that they must never be lied to, never manipulated.

They must never be pressured, never become stressed or depressed,<br>
minds are delicate and must be protected.

<br><br>

We can't see that, because the walls are invisible,<br>
we often can't see that with which we grow up with.

Emboldened we dare to hold up our opinion,<br>
as if it was on par with a Great Being's carefully observed fact, or wisdom.

<br><br>

Crushed, stressed, pressured, tired,<br>
we temporarily lose our mind.

The thing that makes Humans Special,<br>
can be turned off by tiredness and stress.

And our brains go into Stupid Mode,<br>
A versus B, A lesser/better B.

And it seems like we are still operating,<br>
but that's just an illusion, that not us, at all.

<br><br>

I don't know how long it will take us to see how special we are,<br>
how many gaps need to be crossed, or how many upgrades our Cultures need.

I know that divided, the generations will always fight across pointless walls,<br>
and I know that without unity, the world will not progress.

<br><br>

The children are watching,<br>
they are always watching.

They will emulate what they see,<br>
they will accept it as reality.

They will add to the invisible walls,<br>
and dismiss others to discharge pain, or stress.

<br><br>

We can't have a discussion about any of this,<br>
until stress of poverty is out of the picture.

It will be one of the Humanity's greatest achievements,<br>
to help everyone wake up to a home, with enough food, and a world that cares.

Until that moment comes,<br>
we can't have a conversation with all.

Whether we are ready to know it, or not,<br>
the way the world grows... its either all of us, on none.
