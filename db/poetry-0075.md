Well, from the first moment on,<br>
we are asked if we should live in harmony.

We are still very young,<br>
barely know of the world.

And already the question of harmony comes,<br>
and in harmony we learn, and thrive.

Away from it, we'll be interrupted,<br>
and feel lost in the void.

It is a simple choice,<br>
but out minds are not ready to make it.

Often we forget.

We forget about our little gardens,<br>
and all the little walks.

We forget how amazing it felt,<br>
to stand on the wing of a plane.

We forget the taste of popcorn at the Zoo,<br>
or even how enormous Zoo felt.

We forget pebbles at the river,<br>
and mischievous squires at the park.

<br><br>

That little dog with a bark,<br>
that scaredy kitten always hiding in the dark.

Our collection of unused keys,<br>
and the box of bottle caps we collected with ease.

We forgot our Lego and the old bike,<br>
with that seat that we used to really like.

We don't remember the Palaces and Castles,<br>
that we used to love, and those swords, that fit us like a glove.

<br><br>

Everybody else came around,<br>
acting like they know the ground.

But, this was our gift from the Universe,<br>
an affinity for flowering gardens, and little passage ways, and all those flying planes.

It was a key to unlock our mind,<br>
to understand the zoo, and our size in the universe, connect with pebbles at the beach.

It is a pathway that fits us best,<br>
to love little creatures, and collect some shineys, and build with blocks, and ride far and wide.

It was to remind us,<br>
to find our place among Great Beings, and study and pursue excellence, in all we do.

<br><br>

Then they sent us to First Grade,<br>
and the weird kid peed into the Duplo, they didn't even have Lego.

Then the teacher graded you down for counting pebles in your pocket,<br>
and did it so many times, you lost track.

<br><br>

There was a whisper about the pebbles,<br>
it was Mr. Sagan - "You are made of Star Stuff."

And then the kids whispered...<br>
to push you in the mud.

<br><br>

Push their laughter aside,<br>
you'll need to Learn, and learn really hard.

Cause right now, you're in the mud,<br>
and you need to hang on.

It will get worse,<br>
but all you have to do is rise.

Each time,<br>
you'll rise higher.

(When in trouble, call the Police it is OK for kids to call the Police, they'll love helping you, don't be scared.)

<br><br>

Third Grade,<br>
Fifth Grade.

Low grade,<br>
Uhh, but there can't be higher.

Because by this time, you're getting bad grades,<br>
because the teacher thinks you're copying from somewhere.

The bullies know,<br>
you did it on your own.

Saw you pacing for days,<br>
with your first program.

Keep going forward,<br>
don't let go - you're doing great, stay away from the hate.

<br><br>

By the time you're out of Eight Grade,<br>
by rejecting crazy, and nonsense, and stupid, and lazy, you graduate above all others.

Because you didn't follow,<br>
because you chose to study on your own, at your own pace.

Because worthless grades meant nothing,<br>
you felt no stress.

Because, you didn't follow<br>
nothing could hurt you.

And your world is yours,<br>
truly-truly yours.

<br><br>

We unravel, when we forget who we are,<br>
the moment we hide, or pretend, or follow.

And, gosh darn it,<br>
it happens when we are still kids.

We are completely unprepared,<br>
and none will help.

<br><br>

So you! have to keep it together,<br>
you can't let anyone hurt your mind.

In High School, the pretenders make a sudden appearance,<br>
never held a book in their hand.

The back of Hamlet,<br>
all the quotes have more IQ.

Let the little Caesars,<br>
keep the wind from the hall away.

You need to pace your reading at the library,<br>
teach yourself focus.

Don't EVER! finish the books,<br>
just get to the part that is valuable to you, and skip the rest.

<br><br>

Start working on your start-up early,<br>
it is a study in failure.

You need to create a series of CONTROLLED FAILURES,<br>
this is very important.

Learn [content management][1],<br>
and figure out [billing][2]

That's your surface platform,<br>
and think about nature of business.

Never try to build things directly,<br>
facilitate the building of direct things for others.

Help them setup,<br>
so that you are not burdened, and keep going.

Look at the structure of start-up accelerators, or even banks,<br>
they take a percent, and never create what will weigh them down.

Eventually, you can build your own Tesla,<br>
but at first, you start with services.

Look at the gym,<br>
monthly subscription, is most stable.

The lessons, are all around you.

<br><br>

You don't need college,<br>
but taking college classes is very relaxing.

Make sure you get a 4.0 at each class,<br>
be ready to repeat it.

And enjoy,<br>
the lectures.

College is just a toy,<br>
it looks bad on your Portfolio, so hide it.

It is a very weak teaching experience,<br>
and people know that there there is minimal learning involved.

Jumping from high school to start-ups is more impressive,<br>
and shows that you chose knowledge over nonsense.

It shows that you chose to learn on your own,<br>
to take care of your own mind,<br>
rather than to pretend to learn for grades.

Authenticity is very important in life,<br>
it is hard to connect with people that role play.

<br><br>

Bonding with people that are just acting,<br>
is only functional for as long as they are acting.

But it is never good,<br>
eventually they'll have a crisis, similar to a mid-life crisis.

Stay Authentic,<br>
keep to to those who are Authentic.

Be safe.

<br><br>

When it feels like everyone else is having an amazing life,<br>
and you are stuck.

Umm... that not true

But it is also not healthy to think this way about yourself,<br>
you are not beneath the party goers, they don't have what you have in your mind.

<br><br>

But, that's far enough,<br>
time to get some rest.

<br><br>

This is where it gets interesting,<br>
you have primed your mind for Business.

That is a fine first step,<br>
now you need to get ready for the real graduation.

You need to section hike the equivalent of the Appalachian Trail,<br>
and measure your jogging a hundred miles at a time.

Section jogging, the Western States 100.

Mind and Body, for the rest of your life.

You must take good care of both.

<br><br>

At mile fifty, halfway through a run,<br>
as you piece together your blurry thoughts of your next business.

Take some time to understand what it is that College Grads have,<br>
those are very brittle relationships, and inflexible careers.

We all feel the promise, but we can't fake it,<br>
it would be the opposite, and certainly not worthy of you, my Friends.

You can only find your meaning in Authenticity,<br>
shortcuts will only take you back to the beginning.

To live among the Extraordinary,<br>
you must become Extraordinary yourself.

<br><br>

The gateway to Meaning of Life,<br>
is in that tiny moment when you think to your self:

"I am not going to jog tonight, I need rest."

Right there in that dot,<br>
is the keyhole,<br>
to the key that you are,<br>
to the gateway that you need to open.

Life is not a simulation,<br>
there are no days off,<br>
life is quite a challenge,<br>
and demands that each moment builds on the authenticity of the previous.

<br><br>

Open the dot, how can you yearn for Authenticity and Companionship,<br>
and cancel, and fall short, and not enough, and rest some more.

The gateway between Ordinary and Extraordinary,<br>
is in accepting that we haven't got a choice to make.

But shoes... to put on,<br>
your Mind and Body must grow in harmony.

You must not let go of the Harmony,<br>
of your Magnificent Existence.

Each small success, by subtle analogy,<br>
pushes you forward, to your next step.

<br><br>

Eventually your tightly controlled business failures,<br>
will fail, they will, fail to fail.

Your mind too,<br>
it won't perceive the easy choice as an option.

All- will proceed,<br>
in harmony.

<br><br>

Labored breathing,<br>
by the Pine Trees at Western States,

Another great step in Automation of your business,<br>
and more investors.

And you're no longer stopping at the first thing you find in books,<br>
you understand all of it.

What is made by humans,<br>
is also All Too Human.

<br><br>

And the Bullies are Gone,<br>
and Eight Grade still sucks.

High school ... influences,<br>
are trying to figure out where they went wrong - good luck!

College, is still a very romantic idea,<br>
but it is best left to imagination.

Your dreams are so much more now,<br>
only what you create can live up to them.

You are a Leader,<br>
full of might an joy.

<br><br>

And now you know,<br>
shortcuts only lead people to their beginnings.

And the one road, the only road,<br>
was the one of Authenticity, and Achievement.

Where we learned for real, not for grades,<br>
where what we learned added up to create wisdom, and not a stupid GPA.

You'll be OK, so as long as you Learn onward and become Wise,<br>
and Live in Authentic Harmony with Yourself.

This is how you become an Adult,<br>
that was the one thing that all others were missing.

It's what made them pretend and simulate,<br>
but, growing up can't be faked.

Growing up has to be written by the choices you make,<br>
on the surface, that is your lifetime.

The dreams you always dream, will come true,<br>
but not in your childhood, childhood is for learning.

Live in Harmony with yourself,<br>
and live in harmony with the Universe.

Growing up is really special,<br>
it is really important for our health.

It is a deeply internal process,<br>
and there are no shortcuts to growing up.

It is meant to be,<br>
Beautiful.
