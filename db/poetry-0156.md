[Listen](audio/poetry-0156.mp3)

I woke up at five,<br>
and I felt alive.

I left at five forty two,<br>
I could still smell the dew.

The sun was still down,<br>
and the clouds looked brown.

<br><br>

But I ran,<br>
like Superman.

I had weights in each hand,<br>
ready to conquer Westland.

<br><br>

Though by the time I got to Central City,<br>
I felt just about as strong as a little kitty.

But I kept going,<br>
and the sky started glowing.

It was really pretty,<br>
...the sunrise finally came to the city.

There was a cloud or two,<br>
but that only added to the view.

<br><br>

I ran much faster, like I had superpowers,<br>
and made the six miles under two hours.

It is my best time thus far,<br>
and I felt like a superstar.

But, I have a lot more training to do,<br>
...though I must say, I already grew.

<br><br>

I love how I am making proggres jooging<br>
and bodybuilding and blogging...

...and all at the same time,<br>
that sure is a lot of adventure and rhyme.
