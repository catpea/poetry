Growing up, getting up, moving up, rising up,<br>
we each have this abstract sense of a special direction.

It calls to us when we are down,<br>
and it calls when we **can** go higher.

You don't even need to speak a language,<br>
just lift you finger and point to the sky.

It works for everything and every time,<br>
it encourages us to continue to rise.

There is always an up,<br>
and never an end in sight.

<br><br>

Growing up demands that we open our eyes and rise,<br>
stand our ground and look to the skies.

So as long as we aim for the tallest of mountains and rise,<br>
our knowledge will quickly catch up in size.

Wherever we begin, we **can** rise,<br>
to grow in wisdom to no end, **is** the ultimate prize.

May we each discover our path to wisdom and rise,<br>
cheerfully becoming mighty and wise.
