Bicycling some years ago, out thirty miles away,<br>
along a road, and an ancient highway.

I found an overpass where I could perch upon,<br>
and I discovered I wasn't really alone.

I figured it was the a huge love story,<br>
about a boy named Harold and a girl named Wally.

She was a Book Worm, a Hero, and a Graffiti Artist,<br>
and Harold loved her because she was the Smartest!

Wally fell in love with Harold,<br>
as she knew he was a Poet with a Heart of Gold.

In 1980 some 40 years ago,<br>
the two adventurers gave it ago.

They set off for Center State,<br>
and that became their Longest Date!

It all their walking, it never rained,<br>
and it never too sunny, neither complained.

They waked holding hands together for a hundred miles,<br>
their adventure was amazing, nothing but smiles.

When they finally arrived at Mount Pleasant,<br>
Harold quietly gave Wally her present.

It was a little book of foolish rhyme,<br>
that Harold wrote over a long stretch of time.

They both just happily turned 57,<br>
their life together is pure Heaven.

Both are super smart, extremely young, and very strong,<br>
their sweet love for each other, is lifelong.

They still do their Mount Pleasant walk,<br>
holding hands for days, sleeping-in until nine o'clock.

Harold makes really, really good Vegan Lettuce Wraps,<br>
and Wally is a master at reading Maps.

They've been to all kinds of interesting places,<br>
and they always arrive with beaming and smiling faces.

just in case any of you guys want to go.
