Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Thirty Five.

I am not sure that the end of quarantine will ever arrive,<br>
so I am preparing to write enough poetry to fill a hard drive.

I think I shall begin writing about cats,<br>
and then complain a bit about bureaucrats.

When I am done complaining,<br>
I shall pick something more entertaining.

Like perhaps musing about Lowbrow Art,<br>
and then carry on babbling about someone smart.

Maybe a Scientist, or a Philosopher like Descartes,<br>
or maybe a colorful leader like Napoleon Bonaparte.

Then, when, I'll run out of things to babble on,<br>
I will jump on my bicycle and set off at dawn,

I'll bring my notepad and a pen,<br>
and come up with a new idea,<br>
every now and then.
