Somehow, Wednesday turned out to be the tiniest day.<br>
I was quiet all day, slowly programming away.

I've been thinking about my bicycle, birds, and rain,<br>
but mostly working on my new website domain.

My bicycle trails have been calling me all week,<br>
I prepared my bicycle and am I ready, so to speak.

There was much rain today,<br>
it will take a few more days, before I pedal away.

It is not always about the adventure,<br>
I love how all the spring trees smell.

How the birds sing in the morning,<br>
how the air is crisp and new.

I never set a plan as to how far I will ride,<br>
I just get on the bicycle and enjoy the outside.

Every once in a while I perch upon an overpass,<br>
scribble code, or just watch the cars sometimes.

There are many memorable places along the way,<br>
they are all very tiny and hidden away.

Old graffiti, sculptures and parks, abandoned railway,<br>
I could talk about them all day.
