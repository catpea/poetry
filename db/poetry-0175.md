There are tipping points in your intellectual development,<br>
where you go from careful observation to certainty of knowing.

You build one thing on top of the other,<br>
it becomes your Temple of Knowledge.

If you are correct about it all,<br>
then the more you add the more you understand.

<br><br>

To learn for real,<br>
we need fascination.

And we need freedom to move between curiosities,<br>
and there are no divisions of subjects here.

We may learn numbers from calculating how many potential exoplanets our radio signals reached,<br>
or we may trade mathematical notation for computer programming-languages where we can bring numbers to life.

Then quickly leap to Astrophotography, and learn about Biology from books written by Astrobiologists,<br>
Enlightenment is not just about what we target precisely, but also what we learn along the way.

<br><br>

Enlightenment is Life, it is going round and round, and higher and higher,<br>
through all these tiny twisty passages of Curiosity and Fascination to Discover more and more Light.

There is no need to divide Enlightenment from Wisdom and Knowledge,<br>
but we must make a strong division between Real Education that brings results,<br>
and Fake Education that makes you unhappy, exhausted, stressed.

Because unhappiness, exhaustion and stress,<br>
will **stop you** from growing up, from becoming wise and enlightened,<br>
from becoming an inspiration and helping the world grow a little.

<br><br>

It is a scary thing to aim away from everything we've been taught to want,<br>
but you are you and not what someone tells you to be

...and you are supposed to be much more courageous than merely taking your own path in life,<br>
we can't live like quiet little mice just to be nice.

We have too much imagination, too much passion and inspiration, foresight insight and vision,<br>
we are not to live ordinary lives.

<br><br>

We are Thinking Humans!<br>
We are to live Lives of Inspired Enlightenment.

Because that's what furthers Human Kind the most,<br>
because that is part of what is **best** within us.

Human Kind must grow in Wisdom and Enlightenment,<br>
each of us is more than capable of becoming a Great Being.

When we grow the Wold Grows With Us,<br>
let us make this world a better place for us all.
