Of all the filthy creatures from The Baltic Sea to Lake Michigan,<br>
there is but one I miss and always rejoice to see again.

Never, have I met a creature more Awful and Cheerful than the [Ring-billed Gull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring-billed_gull),<br>
and not a single moment we spent together was any dull.

The most awful gang, lives over by the Ludington State Park,<br>
they show up in the morning, and do not leave until dark.

They are the hungriest, and the filthiest, and the most lovable bunch,<br>
they live to entertain themselves and steal people's lunch.

<br><br>

If there is one thing that needs to be said,<br>
it is that they want to **steal** your food and **really hate** being fed.

Once, I have seen them gang up on a fool holding up a chunk of bread,<br>
they all swooped down squeaking, and I worried they'd peck him dead.

Though in the end he was probably fine,<br>
as I saw him later in the day studying the "DO NOT FEED SEAGULS" sign.

But as long as you let them steal your food,<br>
they will keep you company, and all will be good.

<br><br>

I also like those rare Seasoned Parking-lot Pirates that show up in Spring,<br>
they can fly to any sea or ocean, but they pick a parking-lot; and that's their thing.

They always seem like they up to something no good,<br>
probably looking to deliver one of their sick gifts on someones hood.

But, I always feel sad when they fly away for warmer climes,<br>
they always remind me of strange wilderness adventures and good times.
