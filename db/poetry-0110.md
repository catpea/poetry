Humanity must not be scared of poverty,<br>
poverty is just a symptom of immature, shortsighted politics.

For politics to grow up and begin helping the world heal,<br>
**we** must begin growing up, and inspire the children to growing up as well.

Nothing will change, nothing can change,<br>
unless we begin our lives by resuming where great beings left off.

There is just one road for all to agree,<br>
the road of Reality, Results, Knowledge, Wisdom, Excellence, and Good Ideas.

We receive a very good impression of the meaning of Wisdom when we are children,<br>
we think of Adults as all-knowing, as always correct, and perfect.

This is our aim now, for in the absence of teachers we must become the teachers,<br>
we must become the adults we wished we grew up with.

This is how we make the World better,<br>
for our generation, and moreso for the new generation, and all those yet to come.

We can't hope for change,<br>
and not grow to meet that demand ourselves.

The change we need,<br>
is driven by Permanent Inheritance of Culture of Wisdom for all generations to come.

A Fine Culture, is self repairing, and it always heals,<br>
it towers over forces of poverty, pain, bondage, fear, anger, hopelessness, shyness, and loneliness.

And a fine culture is what we expect of the adults that we meet as children,<br>
once we become this culture, and the children learn that it is real.

The children will see it as an actual, realistic aim to grow into,<br>
and they will enter a culture of beginning their lives, by resuming at the point where we leave off.

In order for Humanity to Grow,<br>
a Central Universal Culture of Knowledge, Wisdom, and Excellence, should emerge.

A Central Meeting Point,<br>
for all cultures that choose to leave bad ideas behind and converge on Wisdom and Peace.
