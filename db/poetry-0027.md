Captain's Log, Eternal, Quarantine, Day Twenty Two.

Eeeeek! It's raining, I am trying not to be complaining.<br>
But the sky is no longer blue, what am I to do?

Each time I sneeze, the power goes out,<br>
not to say my sneezes are not petite, or that I am ill!

No, I am perfectly fine, I don't need to blow my nose.<br>
It is the transformer outside that blows!

Frantically, atomically I hit CTRL+S, CTRL+S, save, save. Saves,<br>
as the thunderous thunder thunders its electromagnetic waves.

How am I going to finish, how can I upload,<br>
when any moment something will explode,<br>
and there will be nothing where current once flowed.

While the rain has slowed, my fingers still tapping,<br>
Save, save, save! rise! against the Gigawatt Wave.

Seriously, please remember to save your files,<br>
this can only result in more smiles.

Also, please remember to backup your files.<br>
As that's even better, by miles.
