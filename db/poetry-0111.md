There cannot be jogging without acting crazy,<br>
if you're not snarling and spitting you're just being lazy.

Not to mention that its discussing to swallow those little files,<br>
you're not supposed to **keep** them, they're not your prize.

Ultimately, it makes no difference what race it may be,<br>
manners go out the window, the moment you bend your knee.

<br><br>

Plus, nobody really runs to win the race,<br>
we just set the correct pace and run to find our place in Space.

The physical challenge is found in taking each step,<br>
and not stopping until the last rep.

But that's easy, it is the simplest thing about it all,<br>
your body just gets used to it, and has a ball.

<br><br>

Jogging is mostly a little reminder that we are to turn our life to Art,<br>
that we are to overcome our limits, and become super smart.

The actual achievement is found in finishing what we start,<br>
and the thousand other things we finish, by _subtle analogy_ to this odd Art.

In a word, we jog for our future selves,<br>
so that they may become **proud** of themselves.
