Endurance, like speaking, or memorizing poems, and languages languages,<br>
or recalling details on the walls of our childhood home, streets of our city,<br>
is a talent we are all born with.

Like memorizing a poem, or learning a language it is a slow process,<br>
we adapt gradually, and gradually we must increase the difficulty of our workout.

Dancing, or Jogging with dumbbells is a nice example,<br>
we can extent duration of our workout or the distance of our run,<br>
increase the beat of the music or our pace,<br>
and of course slowly increase the weight of the dumbbell.

<br><br>

This requires a long time, a daily routine,<br>
but the gentler it is, the more frequently it can be done.

Running a 10K every morning is probably too tiring,<br>
the body will grow weaker rather than adapt to handle more,
certainly at first.

Running a Dumbbell-10K every other day,<br>
seems to work out well, and the door to increasing distance is open.

This is a good example of increasing frequency, being a bad idea,<br>
but being able to run longer with heavier dumbbells, being well within reach.

<br><br>

Without gradually sneaking in more difficulty,<br>
the workout won't progress as well as it could, but it will still progress.

Open-world workouts like dancing or jogging with dumbbells,<br>
help with burning fat, and build up useful muscles that protect us from injury.

Waking up to crispy and fresh air, putting on your gear,<br>
and getting out there with dumbbells in hand is a wonderful way to enjoy a morning sunrise.

If you have to stay home, then know that there is a wonderful alternative to jogging,<br>
and that is dancing grab your dumbbells and begin by mastering the [Melbourne Shuffle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_shuffle)
