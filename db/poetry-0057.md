Every way of thinking about the world,<br>
brings us closer together, despite, what we are told.

There is just one little thing to keep in mind,<br>
we have to leave all the bad ideas, behind.

Exchange of ideas came a long way,<br>
but we still need to eliminate foul play.

Because not everyone is educated,<br>
and without wisdom life gets complicated.

Misinformed people are easily swayed,<br>
they are often unprepared, and very scared.

If we build to remove their fears,<br>
they will love us... to tears.

The most powerful early-tool is the Audiobook,<br>
wisdom delivered in a way that's hard to overlook.

It is private, and comes with no shame,<br>
it can take a person from poverty to Hall of Fame.

And the best type of things to listen to,<br>
are memoirs or lectures, that enlarge a world view.

We must stop bad education from tearing us apart,<br>
we each have to learn, and become smart.

This day of Wisdom, and Peace that we yearn,<br>
comes closer each day that we learn.
