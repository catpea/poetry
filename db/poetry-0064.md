Now is the time,<br>
it is always the time.

You are never too old,<br>
you are never too large.

But whoever you are,<br>
You are always too beautiful!

Jogging is a wise teacher,<br>
it teaches bodybuilding.

More importantly, it teaches,<br>
that our bodies are powerful.

But, they do not adapt as quickly,<br>
as our fancies strike us.

There is one fantastic way to jog,<br>
measure how long you can run.

And how long you need to rest,<br>
to run that long again.

Make the jogging number (1 minute)<br>
and the rest number (2 minutes)<br>
your friends for the Spring.

Rest 5 times, jog four,<br>
don't be too hard on yourself.

Jogging is difficult,<br>
because you should dance first.

Dancing and walking,<br>
are lovely at making you a Jogger.

But if you are in a hurry,<br>
as many joggers are,<br>
a bit of Rest & Jog Tango will do.

So, rest, jog, rest jog, rest jog,<br>
rest jog, and rest.

Don't push yourself too hard,<br>
but you have to run each day.

Some days, you can just walk - so as long,<br>
as it is three times longer than your jog.

Above all, be good to yourself,<br>
because, you are beautiful to me.

And do not forget that you can put,<br>
blueberry jam into a huge salad,<br>
to make a new kind of fruit for health nuts.

I know you can do it,<br>
I believe in you, I really do.
