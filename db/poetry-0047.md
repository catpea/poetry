Think of a trickster, a real bad fool.

What a great robbery it would be.<br>
If your parents sent you to college.<br>
And teachers sold disconnected snippets.<br>
And called it knowledge.

And wouldn't it be convenient,<br>
if you could chose you next batch.<br>
Wouldn't the trickster rejoice,<br>
had you called, that, a choice.

And then at the end of the day.<br>
When hard earned money was taken.<br>
You wouldn't even be shaking,<br>
even though it was worse than a break-in.

Think of a trickster, a real bad fool,<br>
that took away your very own school.

The moral of this story,<br>
is that you should think through,<br>
when someone offers to teach you.

Education, requires that you learn on your own,<br>
that something that teaching can only postpone.
