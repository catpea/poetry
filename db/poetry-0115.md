All those High and Mighty claims of<br>
"I am stronger", "I can run longer", "You can't do what I do", are bunk.

But they also beautifully underline the importance of Endurance,<br>
nothing is more important for an Athlete than Proper Endurance.

Without a solid measure endurance,<br>
we probably can't push out body into adaptation.

In a way, will run out of the ability to go forward,<br>
just before our body notices it needs to make some changes.

Endurance may just be the very core of any and all Athletic pursuits,<br>
including Bodybuilding, Gymnastics, and even Dancing.

It is easiest to see that in Long Distance running,<br>
in order to finish the race, we have to gradually increase our distance.

It is very unhealthy to try to run an ultra-marathon,<br>
without having first worked on our endurance.

In bodybuilding lifting something 30 times may entertain a muscle,<br>
but it is unlikely to influence it to develop to be better.

Slowly gaining endurance to lift, three hundred times, three thousand times, and fifteen thousand times...<br>
Will reliably encourage your body to adapt.

Gradually increasing endurance, and eating a healthy and balanced diet,<br>
will slowly send a signal to your body, that it must adapt.

Endurance is the secret,<br>
and **gradually** is the method of increasing it.
