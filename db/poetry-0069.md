Some adventurers,<br>
wrestle bears.

Others,<br>
runaway from their fathers.

I,<br>
bemoan the lack of Wi-Fi.

<br><br>

That is, until the night comes about,<br>
at which point all the wild creatures come out.

I've heard stories of owls swooping down from the air,<br>
just to rip out whatever is left of a man's hair.

Then there are the occasional mad deer,<br>
always shimmy-shammying around like they had a beer.

The coyotes are especially frightening,<br>
they come in groups, flashing their eyes like lightening.

One time I tried to turn on a flashlight,<br>
as it turned out - to all the big spider's delight.

Let me tell ya, It takes a man with a lot of brass,<br>
not to scream, when a spider crawls out with a huge glowing ass.

<br><br>

Once, an older lady from a near by camp went to get more booze from her car,<br>
and then misjudged her distance, and walked back too far.

I was sleeping on the ground in my tiny tent,<br>
and then all of a sudden she started yelling out in her lost torment.

Of course, in the middle of the night, and woods and my sleep,<br>
she didn't sound like a lady but rather some huge creepy creep.

She found her way back, and I am sure they partied hard,<br>
but not knowing what made all those screams, I slept - on guard.

<br><br>

Porcupines, oh, you've never seen one like I did,<br>
it was huge, covered in spikes, and really fit.

It could outrun a car or two,<br>
probably, bite a tire and chew.

But then I came across a sign,<br>
and it turned out that the biggest creature, was not the Porcupine,

I was always pretty happy that none of the creatures that bite,<br>
could actually take me down in a single swipe.

But the sign read, **Beware Of Bear**<br>
and that to me was the biggest scare.
