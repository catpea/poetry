You are not alone,<br>
and all you do matters.

As you rise,<br>
you create a way for others to follow.

Struggle, like suffering,<br>
is a gas that fills all the available space.

It is never easy for anybody,<br>
the difference is in the choices we make and the aims we set.

The first Great Choice is to set off towards wisdom,<br>
to continuously transcend our limits thorough out our entire existence.

One of the finest choices we can make,<br>
is to Live Above Common Levels of Life.

There are no guarantees,<br>
your choice to proceed forward is all the guarantee there is.

Our biological life is not finely crafted,<br>
it is a result of fundamental principles of Physics and Chemistry.

But our mind, is up to us to shape,<br>
hence Audio Books and Lectures and our inheritance from of Other Lives, Times, and Works.

You need not hurry,<br>
but you do need to slow down so that you may read and write.

<br><br>

We each have a story to tell,<br>
and many will follow a similar path to ours across the vastness of future.

They could use some advice,<br>
a few fine words about rising, about what it is like to see the sun for the first time.

Do not let your readers suffer the same loneliness you did,<br>
let them learn from you.

<br><br>

And the way you write,<br>
is one thought at a time.

So as long as your write about your unlimited travels,<br>
you never run out of the story to tell.

And every once in a while,<br>
a poem will leap ahead of you.

The thought will arrive,<br>
from the future before you get there.

You are connected to your future self,<br>
no one can hold a stronger bond.

You are a being, with a mind and body, you are in the present,<br>
but you exist across time.

Your Life Line, your Life Time,<br>
The past you and the future you, are connected.

And just the same those who came before you,<br>
and those who are yet to follow, are connected to you.

But you have to write your thoughts,<br>
...when you are rising in your childhood,<br>
the children can understand it best.

In your early age, as you make your way,<br>
as you learn to rise, and find your rhythm,<br>
your readers will be in their twenties.

And then, forties, and then sixties, and eighties, and hundreds,<br>
at no point in your life should you be ashamed to write,<br>
or be shamed for writing.

<br><br>

Because if you can manage to hold your pen,<br>
it is more than most others can.

One thought at a time,<br>
help others understand how to climb.

Make all your struggles count for more,<br>
show them how you fought for wisdom in your war.

Tell the world what you know,<br>
so that others may safely follow.

Know that the first struggles sometimes mean more,<br>
sometimes the hardest challenge is to get off the floor.

The first steps after all,<br>
matter the most to those whose worlds may be seem small.

All steps matter and in many ways,<br>
all lead to enlightenment, and the Sun's rays.
