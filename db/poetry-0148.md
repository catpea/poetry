My Friends,

Not only are we unable to directly conjure up the greatest of our heights,<br>
in that they must ensue from our Greatness & Pursuits.

But also,<br>
we can't see that which we will miss.

A mistake hidden within the heartbreaking realm of never knowing what we missed,<br>
an old, odd realm, strangely built with invisible walls.

<br><br>

The only way we can be sure that we have not fallen to some prison of invisible walls,<br>
is to keep moving forward and up, and never stop.

<br><br>

If our elder selves, do end up, having regrets that begin with, "I wish I knew...",<br>
then by pushing forward today, we let them know that we have done our Best.

We send a message of compassion to our future selves,<br>
late at night, at 3AM, the older you, will lay awake, and say:

"I was amazing, there was noting else I could do..."

Our elder selves need to know that we lived boldly, courageously,<br>
it is for their health, and so that feel proud, and can get back to sleep with a smile.

<br><br>

I am always sad about never hearing about this from teachers,<br>
that our life is one, in many profound ways.

That authenticity is not some ideal,<br>
but just another name for Health, for Sanity, for Strength.

When we are older we realize that shortcuts are worthless and dishonest,<br>
that they only lead to some sacrifice, some piece of us that we never get back.

That throughout our entire lives,<br>
**the longest way**, was the only way.

We must each climb the highest of mountains,<br>
it is how we grow, it is how we bloom,<br>
it is how the Greatest of Heights will Ensue.
