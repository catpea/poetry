One late afternoon I hopped on my bicycle to ride the trail,<br>
and returned with an interesting tale.

For right where 275 and Michigan meet,<br>
I found a [little bicycle path that's really neat](https://goo.gl/maps/En5tWm4Z93mmwtZ28).

<br>

It is a huge park that branches out to two more little parks,<br>
though they are behind peoples houses and pack a lot of dog barks.

All combined together they make a sweet little quest,<br>
but make sure to bring plenty of water and rest.

<br>

The main path has little river bridges and lots of really neat sights,<br>
but be really careful about ticks and mosquitoes bites.

And that northern stretch under the power line, is a sight to see,<br>
it is just a barren bumpy grassland without a single tree.

<br>

If you keep going north on Haggerty you'll reach Ford,<br>
and then you can bicycle back to 275 and get back on board.

But I think the woodland trail is the best because there is a lot of shade,<br>
I imagine that's why it was made.
