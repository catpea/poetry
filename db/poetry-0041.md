Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Thirty Six.<br>
Today has been an interesting mix,

We have to be strong,<br>
and go far and long.

We can't sit around,<br>
looking at the ground,

We are each a hero,<br>
and none are zero.

Everybody counts,<br>
care for each other amounts,

It amounts to Happiness and Cheer,<br>
and all the Wonders we hold Dear.
