There is a very special group of people, that many have forgotten,<br>
our Intellectual Foremothers and Forefathers.

They brings us gifts wrapped in the primitive art of writing text, on paper.<br>
It is frequently all they had, it was the only way to reach us.

They are brilliant, and healthy, and unbroken, and triumphant,<br>
they are full of light, more than history will ever tell us.

Nobody who outlives an empire, will have their history shown for the lovely thing it was.<br>
This served to protect them, and it failed to erase them.

We must never allow ourselves to merely listen to history,<br>
because those are always writ by prevalent powers, it was their job to erase them.

More modern Philosophers had the same problem,<br>
Our friend, Dear Friedrich, and what a Warrior...

Was smeared by the Nazis, he was so powerful, that everyone wanted a piece of his might.<br>
Friedrich Nietzsche hated what Nazis stood for.

Recently, one of the Great Modern Philosophers was under attack, it deeply hurt and frightened her,<br>
but her classrooms rose for her with noting but love and continued admiration.

We are tasked with bringing the light of our hearts, and resurrecting those who passed,<br>
not by merely understanding their books, but by understanding what they were trying to say.

And it is OK, to understand them in our own way at first,<br>
it takes time, to befriend someone, from a book, across time.

Yes, all we have to go on, is text on paper.<br>
But we know they were just like us, they were All Too Human, friendly, and of good cheer.

If they made mistakes, these Great Beings were not stained for long,<br>
they rose, and they took their miserable failures, to create gifts of prevention for us.

These gifts are complex, they are as complex and nuanced as You and I.<br>
It takes hard work to inherit gifts this powerful.

The only way to unwrap those Gifts of Wisdom is with Admiration, Friendship and Love,<br>
schools teach us to see Great Beings as these synthetic monoliths of concrete.

But nothing could be further from the truth, because all these Great Beings,<br>
they were once kids, and teenagers, they had heartaches, dreams and hopes.

They were just like you and I, but they invented ideas that they cared to share,<br>
and they rose to the challenges of leadership to preserve them.

Those ideas are our intellectual inheritance,<br>
here is my attempt to name a few for your pleasure.
