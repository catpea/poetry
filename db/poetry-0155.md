I was tossing and turning late at night,<br>
only to be awoken by thunder and a flash of light.

The room shook and I felt it in my chest,<br>
but I was wearing earplugs so I didn't hear the rest.


I used to be scared of thunder quite a bit,<br>
then I was told if you can hear it - you didn't get hit.

I am not sure what kind of advice that is,<br>
but it made thunderstorms a breeze.


I figured it was going to be too wet and muddy,<br>
to ride my iron horse buddy.

So I resumed working on my web page,<br>
and now I am in the finishing stage.


When all else fails there is always web design,<br>
at the end of the day everything will turn out fine.

I had to rest a bit as I switched from 8PM to 5AM for my endurance running,<br>
but now I feel can resume, and become even more stunning.
