Your Earthly Lineage begun some four billions years ago,<br>
you ancestors weren't human, they couldn't even breathe Oxygen.

We gradually adapted to changing conditions,<br>
to chemical composition of our Little Lonesome Blue Earth.

In a mere Hundred Million years, we will be as different from who we are today,<br>
as a Shrew is different from a Great Ape.

<br><br>

But, one thing will never change,<br>
and that is how special life that begun on Earth is.

How colorful and unique our good ideas,<br>
how different we must be from what life there may be out in space.

And how incredibly close we all are,<br>
we are such a tightly knit family, we share so much.

<br><br>

And we can think without restrictions,<br>
we don't have short memory, we don't lack imagination.

Our ideas come from nowhere and everywhere,<br>
we dream about anything and everything, here and everywhere.

And we have poetry, and paintings, and doodles,<br>
we have sculptures that are made out of stone and metal.

<br><br>

And above all, we are all born a Royalty, and our proper posture,<br>
is to rise to the challenge of becoming Philosopher Queens, and Philosopher Kings.

Our consciousness, makes it so that we must rise to no end,<br>
step after step, book after book, work of art, after a work of art.

<br><br>

Do not be scared,<br>
Above All, Love Yourself.

Humanity is in a process of amassing Culture,<br>
whether we notice it or not, **it is** abandoning bad ideas.

And, You Are Born A Royalty,<br>
And Your aim, is to become Philosopher Queens, and Kings.

<br><br>

Say it with me:<br>
Forbearance, Hardihood, Largesse, Benevolence, and Honour.

Restraint, Dignity, Nobility, Unbreakability, Fortitude, Courage,<br>
Love; and Insight; and Foresight; and Understanding; and Authenticity; and Heroism;

And Celebrate<br>
Your Beautiful Life.
