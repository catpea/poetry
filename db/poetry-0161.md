We are each born to a unique environment,<br>
family arrangement, economic level, and intellectual culture.

To be fair, unique environment is good so as long as it it positive, safe;<br>
it is just as beautiful to walk a Tree Root Bridge as it is Ride a Bull or Tuktuk.

So as long as it is a place that we can safely grow from,<br>
a place with a good library of inspirational books of Adventure and Philosophy.

Family, like the neighborhood has to be safe as well,<br>
they have to be a source of Wisdom, Encouragement, Knowledge, and Enlightenment.

Economic levels, are unfair, no child should be put to poverty,<br>
it is the children of the future generations that repair this.

Intellectual Culture, must begin with a Love of Wisdom, with Admiration of Independence,<br>
of Leadership, Inventiveness, Authenticity, Valor;

The children must be reminded not to throw their youth away on paychecks,<br>
that time is so valuable; that there are not enough atoms in the universe to strike a coin that buys a single second.

<br><br>

Quarks can be alike, but each quasar, molecular cloud, and Human;<br>
is infinitely unique in their configuration.

It is a great tragedy that classrooms often start with the same book,<br>
that office workers eventually synchronize for the sake of simplicity.

This is not to be allowed,<br>
this is not fair.

This is not the way.

Each mind is unique and requires a unique combination of books,<br>
it may not always take many, three to five per year, so as long as they are re-read many times.

Each book,<br>
helps us build the construction within - Our Universe, Our City; The Concept Map.

The sooner we get to the next plateau of enlightenment,<br>
the safer we are.

<br><br>

If you are a teacher, record audio books, read your books to the students;<br>
make sure they can take them home, and pause, and think, and replay.

Look to Science Popularized, Survey Courses in Philosophy,<br>
help them to get to know some combination the true leaders of this world,<br>

The world belongs to the future generations,<br>
at first; they will need all the help they can get.

And then,<br>
they'll take it from there.
