In the beginning we discover our Universal Self,<br>
the Being we are, regardless, of what Culture or Place we are born into.

Then we set an aim, by asking our Elder Selves what heir regrets are,<br>
the more we advance forward the more we become Ourselves.

The less regrets our Elder Selves have,<br>
the more we become in harmony with ourselves.


The Way Of The Warrior, is a self correcting path,<br>
each time we advance we become stronger, wiser, and more powerful.

Frame after frame, as time ticks away, and our minds and bodies grow,<br>
we near, and finally become; our Elder Selves.

We arrive with Certainty of Knowing that the path we traveled was our own,<br>
that we are in Harmony with Universe, that all our Senses are Finely Tuned.


In moving forward we don't need to ask what life is for,<br>
Life is for the Living, for those who grow and advance forward.

There cannot be any real regrets as we had decades to avoid them,<br>
and whatever obstacles there were, we never lost our way.

The Final Aim, is to rise all the way up, and become a Great Being,<br>
to build a legacy of Wisdom and Good Ideas, Lessons Worth Sharing, and Moving Inspiration.
