Take all that you are,<br>
and forge a suit of armor.

Paint, or sculpt, or cosplay,<br>
we are always all to human, but we are unique.

All your armor decorations, and Your medals of honor,<br>
will show you as you are.

<br><br>

Keep growing up, keep adding to your story,<br>
may your armor reflect the sun.

<br><br>

And let go of the Poker Face,<br>
that's not really You.

If you must, show everyone how Mighty you are,<br>
how Great and beautiful your Heart Is.

Keep growing up, book by book,<br>
poem by poem, art by art, and triumph, and failure.

Build a mountain of worn out running shoes,<br>
and torn up bodybuilding gloves.

Fill Coffee Shops and Galleries with you Art,<br>
with your Sculptures, or Music.

Let who you are protect you from misfortune,<br>
be authentic, always lead your own way, and never follow.

Show The Word,<br>
Who You Are.
