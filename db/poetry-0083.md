[Listen](audio/poetry-0083.mp3)

I've been sitting here for half an hour,<br>
trying to conjure up my poetic power.

But nothing seems to be coming out,<br>
I think I am going through a poetic drought.

I guess this happens every once in a while,<br>
so it is not a reason not to smile.

But I thought I was already better than that,<br>
I felt like the world's most poetic cat.

Now I struggle to come up with the next line,<br>
though I promise not to whine.

Maybe, there is way to break through by block,<br>
perhaps I should stop staring at the clock.

Oh yes, this worked, I feel much better meow!<br>
I remembered every word, wow!

Wig, pig, pear, bear, sled, bed, boat, goat,<br>
top, mop, wall, ball, duck, truck, mouse house, and blouse.

And what a story that would rhyme,<br>
had I not ran out of time.
