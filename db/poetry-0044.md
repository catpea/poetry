Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Thirty Nine,<br>
A vegetable juice out of line.

The Tomato with Sprinkles was born of accident,<br>
when making my salad, this is how it went;

The salad bag tore,<br>
and some of the salad went on the floor.

But a fistful, fell in my tomato juice,<br>
and decorated it with sprinkles of produce.

It is hard to recommend, but I must say,<br>
it tasted great, and I'll drink it everyday.
