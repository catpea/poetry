Anything that can go wrong may go wrong,<br>
and there is only one guarantee in life.

It is a guarantee, precisely because it is within our complete control,<br>
the guarantee is The Greatness Of Our Soul, or Spirit, or Being,

It means you will keep getting up no matter how many times you fall,<br>
it means you will continue moving forward without stopping.

<br>

It means there is no pain, it means there is no weakens,<br>
that it is a function and fact of life that we advance forward.

And on the day of triumph,<br>
it means that the prize is nothing less than Laughter and Joy of Life.

The Greatness of Our Soul, our single guarantee in life,<br>
may begin in discomfort but it concludes with something **far** more.

<br>

Marvels of the Human Spirit that we can't directly conjure up within ourselves,<br>
marvels that can only come out of our Might and Authenticity.

Humor and Foolishness, Cheerfulness and Bliss,<br>
Sweetens and Giggles, Joy, Laughter, Wisdom and Delight.

Greatness of Soul.
