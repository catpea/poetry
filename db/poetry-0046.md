Captain's Log Supplemental, Quarantine, Day Forty.

We are born to run our fingers through infinity,<br>
be it Wright Brothers or Yuri Gagarin, Galileo Galilei.

It is our right to touch the greatest of heights,<br>
and it is our privilege to cheer for each other in triumph.

We have no flaws, no ugliness, no weakness, and no limit,<br>
be it Tenzing and Hillary, or Viktor Emil Frankl.

Nothing can stop us,<br>
there are no bars thick enough,<br>
there are no bars strong enough,

"We are the Captains of our Souls,<br>
And The Masters of Out Fate"

However, there is a culture that we must never let go of,

The culture of, Love of Wisdom,<br>
The culture of, Inheritance of Knowledge.

If we are tricked to reject Wisdom,<br>
and if there is no teacher or parent,<br>
or friend left to remind us,<br>
then all will be lost.

Your work will not set you free,<br>
it is a lie as old as slavery.

Your teachers can only remind,<br>
but they cannot reach into your mind.

Fight for your right to knowledge,<br>
there is no university,<br>
there is no college,<br>
you have to use your heart to learn,<br>
only you can do that.

Without Inheritance of Wisdom,<br>
you will become cursed to start at zero.

As magnificent as your battle will be,<br>
you will only reach a path, that was walked countless times before.

You must start,<br>
where the greatest minds [left off](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Science_communicators).
