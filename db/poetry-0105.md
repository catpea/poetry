My Friends,

Your youth holds a great power,<br>
a power that you can hold on to throughout your entire existence.

It is the power of creating a life that you will love,<br>
a life that will help you see with great clarity.

A Life of Wisdom.

<br><br>

But you must be careful,
as the world may not yet be ready to help you.

Not everyone will know about growing up,<br>
and people will say: "How was I supposed to know?"

And they are not going to be the bad guys,<br>
and you will be inclined to listen to their advice.

And the path will be paved with good intentions,<br>
it maybe the correct path, but it won't be the right one.

<br><br>

Please, focus on building your own self,<br>
your strength, your wisdom, your power.

Focus on building the best you,<br>
the you that you are meant to be, that the world needs.

<br><br>

Because if you listen to everybody else,<br>
you will not grow up, and they will blame you for not being able to help them.

You are not going to be able to explain to them,<br>
that you are weak because of them,<br>
because you tried to help them too early.

And if you could, all they could say will be:<br>
"How was I supposed to know?"

<br><br>

Please, you have no choice,<br>
but to learn to control your own future.

You can try to use your imagination,<br>
to get in touch with your Elder Self;

And ask "What are your regrets?",<br>
"Where did it go wrong?"

<br><br>

Please, carefully evaluate your choices,<br>
wisely build your Mind and Body.

Pay attention to all the choices you are making,<br>
as they dictate the Beautiful Life Ahead of You.

<br><br>

The teachers are not ready, we are not in the Era of Wisdom yet,<br>
people are struggling to understand life.

Many make choices that all too early box them in,<br>
and not all their advice will apply to you.

Not all the things that you think box people in,<br>
actually constrain them, there are many contexts to all the paths.

All lives are beautiful, and there are enough forks in the road,<br>
for people to navigate back to where they want to be.

But, when a mistake occurs, it will weigh you down for a time,<br>
if you are careful, you can avoid the worst of it.

And whatever does happen, regardless of how hard you tried to avoid it,<br>
will not crush you, because you will know you did your best.

<br><br>

Please, be careful in life, be beautiful, and strong,<br>
learn, and think, and evaluate, and judge, and grow in wisdom.

Following everyone's advice, will create a lot of noise,<br>
listening to everything from everywhere will never align with you.

You must lean to pace yourself,<br>
and to carefully and wisely follow what interests you.

Your mind is constantly asking questions,<br>
your future depends on having a good intuition, rooted in reality, and in wisdom.

There is nothing you can be force-taught school,<br>
you will not retain things that are out of sequence.

Reaching out for Knowledge and Wisdom in your own sequence, and at your own pace,<br>
is the only way to learn, and build steps, and build on top of those steps.

No one can decide what lesson you are ready for next,<br>
that is something that comes from the complexity of your own mind.

Those people who are doing well in school without cramming and memorization,<br>
have previously arrived at those subjects in their own sequence.

<br><br>

The same applies to your job, your career,<br>
your career needs to emerge from the path you were growing up with.

It needs to be an an extension of your pursuits,<br>
it must benefit you, and help you grow.

Just like you must actually learn, instead of just getting grades,<br>
your work must add to you, and not, rob you of your years.

Do you understand the value of a Single Year of Your Precious Life?<br>
no one can put a price on that, not even you, there are not enough atoms in the Universe.

That is why Harmony with Education, and Work is so important,<br>
each year must be lived on the path that makes you grow.

<br><br>

I am so sorry, that people will tell you to cram for tests,<br>
and get a job, and get on with life.

I am so sorry, My Friends,<br>
but that is the worst, you can do.

That's why you can't listen to anyone,<br>
that's why you have to look into yourself.

Carefully evaluate all decisions,<br>
whilst carefully evaluating consequences, and being mindful of your future.

You are not alone, look to Memoirs, look to Biographies,<br>
listen to Audiobooks, Explore, and Create.

<br><br>

And you must take care of your body,<br>
the best you can, at first.

And with each year,<br>
you will gain more, and add a bit more as you grow in Health and Fortitude.

Your Elder Self needs to be Flexible, and Healthy,<br>
you may never grunt and complain, that's something you have to be mindful of now.

It is not just about making choices for your Future,<br>
but also for your body too.

<br><br>

Do you see how going along with cramming for tests,<br>
can put you in a field where your job makes life more stressful,<br>
which will prevent you from taking good care of your body?

Imagine the consequences of walking a path that is not truly your own,<br>
and what will your Elder Self feel when you two finally become, One?

Be gentle with yourself,<br>
this is Your Life, Your Beautiful-Beautiful Life.

<br><br>

Put down the incomprehensible Text Book, the standardized tests,<br>
and [find](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/130.Best_Audiobooks_Ever) an Audiobook that you will love and actually learn from.

Stop trying to find a job or get hired, and become the kind of a person;<br>
that companies can only hope to hire.

Start living healthy, years before you start your training,<br>
do not force your body into endurance, gradually teach it to adapt.

<br><br>

Chose Audio-books that really help your wisdom grow,<br>
embrace your hobbies, and expand your adventures.

If you can't find a career path that will add onto you,<br>
then [start your own company](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4JtyLKDjXk),
or become a [co-founder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRLzkbtKPGM).

Take care of your body, be mindful of you [Body Mass Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index),<br>
but also aim to become a Healthy Athlete, Heath will never take away from you.

<br><br>

In all we do, in choices, or intuitions,<br>
we re driven by the wisdom we have thus far acquired.

A decision that made sense in your youth,<br>
may reverse, as you gain wisdom from Books and Experiences.

The richer our Pursuit of Wisdom,<br>
the more in-tune our decision-making.

Wisdom surrounds Education, Carrier and Health,<br>
it influences your Private Decision-making, and thus Your Future.

In most contexts Wisdom is the most important thing,<br>
what can be more important than the thing that influences your private decision making?

And be mindful that your decision making is in turn,<br>
the very thing that influences all the future ahead of you?

<br><br>

The beginning of your Knowledge and Wisdom is found in the things you love as a child,<br>
in a way those things are questions, and playing with them brings answers.

But you have to stay with it,<br>
protect the natural progression of the chain of your curiosities.

You have to understand the the Destructive Power of:<br>
"cram, get a job, and get on with your life".

We don't live in a world that can support your Pursuit of Wisdom,<br>
for most, the world will give minimums, for many nothing.

When we try to create external machinery,<br>
it will often perform the minimum.

<br><br>

The power for the world to change,<br>
is within each of its Citizens.

It is found in decision making,<br>
perpetually strengthened by Unrelenting Pursuit of wisdom.

We create this world together,<br>
and it can only grow, when we grow.
