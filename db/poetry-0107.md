Life shouldn't be about beating your best,<br>
just as important as rising, is your day of rest.

No matter how important your athletic quest,<br>
or how upon your arrival you are going to be blessed.

Everyone, needs to get some rest,<br>
days will only get longer when you are stressed.

<br><br>

If you must,<br>
imagine you are a Bird of Fantastic Plumage, and your bed is a nest.

Come morning, fling up your messy crest,<br>
and puff up your chest.

And tweet, about how you are not getting dressed,<br>
because you are too stressed, and you are having your rest.

And explain to those confused, that you are not speaking in jest,<br>
make it clear that this is not, a test.

<br><br>

Today is _your_ day of rest,<br>
at best, you will be having a nice cup of tea, should you feel pressed.

<br><br>

Allow strength to return to you, so that you are at your best,<br>
tomorrow, or in few days, you'll resume your quest.

Once you are not feeling so stressed,<br>
you'll show the world that You are the Best.
