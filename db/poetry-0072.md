We must make time, to enlarge our view,<br>
and in everything we do, we must first think things through.

Above all, to thine own self be true,<br>
but also your own world, should fit like a good shoe.

<br><br>

With each step you took your mind grew,<br>
with all new things, we never really start anew.

Where ever we go, whatever we go through,<br>
we learn and our wisdom evolves, as we continue.

<br><br>

Sure, sometimes it feels like we don't know what to do,<br>
but when you get sad, the whole Universe becomes slightly more blue,

We may not know exactly what you are going through,<br>
but many of us have been there, we too got stuck until we grew.

<br><br>

Many great beings get hurt, but all plow on through,<br>
you are not alone, in our own thoughts, we sit right next to you.

Please push trough the pain, and look through the zoo,<br>
when all is writ, and said and done, we all still need you,

<br><br>

There is a blinding beauty to who you already are - I wish you knew,<br>
with each step forward, you become a brighter star, and we love you.

Don't worry, so as long as to your own self you stay true,<br>
it will all pass, and when looking back you'll say - "I Grew."
