Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Thirty Four.

I finished a big program, but I am ready for more.

So, I am writing a poem, and its always very hard,<br>
because I never know what its going to be about.

One moment, I am mighty, serious, and athletic,<br>
then I sit to the poem, and I lose that aesthetic.

In my early 20s I wore a Blues Brother suit for office work,<br>
but even that didn't work, cause I added cowboy-shoes,<br>
and a huge buckle, not a day past when I didn't get a chuckle.

Later it got even worse, I wore leather pants and a Matrix coat,<br>
I fit into my coffee shop like a mountain goat.

Being serious is just too darn hard,<br>
I don't have the might,

OK, that's enough for this poetic flight,<br>
I am done writing, y'all have goodnight.
