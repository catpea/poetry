For those of you who had trouble,
finding the Northern end of the I-275 Bicycle Tail.

Hines connects North and South parts,<br>
but it is really hard to find the [North Entry Point](https://goo.gl/maps/AimpKxWarbhiX8zbA)

I got on my bicycle today,<br>
and took some pictures.

You have to find the M-14 Overpass,<br>
or an Overpass with a huge dark rail beneath.

That rail is the support beam,<br>
for the Trail On-ramp.

![Ramp Hiding](image/poetry-0119-ramp-hiding.jpg)

A bit further down the road,<br>
there is a road that leads up to the On-ramp.

![Ramp Access](image/poetry-0119-ramp-access.jpg)

It is a ramp specially made,<br>
for the Handsome Adventurous Bicyclist.

It opens like the door to a secret garden,<br>
very few people bicycle there.

![Continues](image/poetry-0119-continues.jpg)

The trail continues for many more miles,<br>
all the way up to 14 Mile Road.

![Forever](image/poetry-0119-forever.jpg)

Over at 14 Mile it ends wonderfully unceremoniously,
it just pops out onto a sidewalk.

Where motorists jump in their cars slightly,
as you pop out slightly dehydrated, a little crazed, a bit wild.
