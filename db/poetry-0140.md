We are granted Consciousness,<br>
but given no guarantees by the Universe.

The only guarantee we have is Ourselves,<br>
the one Element that we are truly in control of.

The deliberate act of Growing Up,<br>
is a constant reminder of that control.

<br><br>

Dusk and Twilight, Tears in the Rain, and Aches in Every Muscle,<br>
surrounded by Unfairness, Blindness, Ends Everywhere, and yet we Rise.

Though it may be the very end of some world,<br>
we are never robbed of the choice to keep going forward.

<br><br>

The choice to exert control over the walls that the Universe has us up against,<br>
when all else has gone dark, the choice always remains.

And when we can no longer change the World,<br>
then we have to grow up to gain new powers that fit that world better.

The new powers will, alter the world,<br>
and eventually we will find our way back home.

<br><br>

No matter what misery or battles mark our past,<br>
having chosen to Rise, and Learn, and Rebuild; made us Beautiful.

No matter what challenges lie ahead,<br>
The Great Act of Growing Up, is an Inexhaustible Source of Unlimited Wisdom.

And the sum of it all,<br>
is the Great Health and Joy of Life.
