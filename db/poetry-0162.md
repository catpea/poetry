Do not let unfairness crush or burden you,<br>
rise up against it, and speak out.

Do not let anyone or anything make you feel tired,<br>
tiredness will cloud your judgment until it is too late.

Do not let anything stand between you and sunshine,<br>
the morning dew, the sleepy meadow, the red sunsets.

Do not let heartless cowards sell you on a cheap victory,<br>
a True Warrior begins with wisdom, and grows inside out.

Learn to recognize the influence of isolation, fatigue, fear,<br>
and let it fade, as it is not part of your personality.

<br><br>

Let go,<br>
of past mistakes.

Learn to recognize that the younger you, was doing the best they thought they could,<br>
but with less wisdom, less knowledge, less awareness, and less experience.

Growing up creates a great wall between the mistakes you might have made in your youth,<br>
and the much wiser person you are today.

Dear Reader, if you - as you are today, **would not** do the same as the younger you,<br>
then you need to stop blaming yourself; it is not *your* fault anymore.

Do, whatever else you must do to grow strong,<br>
and turn your attention to the world, and to the future.

<br><br>

The future generations need help with their thoughts, with their concept of the world.<br>
With the interpretation of their intellectual inheritance; history, books, stories, poems.

Help them avoid or overcome,<br>
help them **see** the world better.

Use your hard earned wisdom,<br>
to **add** to the world.

<br><br>

The children need your help, your wisdom, your knowledge, your experiences,<br>
so that they can learn faster, avoid mistakes, see more, envision new heights.

Do not let children start at the same height you started,<br>
do not push them to repeat the same path you already traveled.

The world can only grow,<br>
when the new generation, stands on the shoulders of the one that came before it.
