Your light must be a true reflection of Yourself,<br>
so that You may be truly seen and understood.

Do not hide, emulate, simulate, pretend, or serve;<br>
that only disrupts Your light and path.

You are already special enough,<br>
You are a Child of The Universe.

You are meant to become a Great Being through your own journey,<br>
You are meant to bring enlightenment, unseen before.

<br><br>

Please, take good care of Yourself,<br>
You are responsible for Your delicate mind and body.

And take care of Your Elder Self,<br>
so that You may have no regrets come Your Golden Age.

<br><br>

Your Existence, requires that You walk Your own path,<br>
that You lead Your own way.

But the path is not a straight line,<br>
it is more of a flat spiral, you are never far from yourself.

There is so much of You in Your Elder Self,<br>
and there is so much of Your Elder self in You already.

<br><br>

Be good to Her, love Yourself,<br>
be mighty, and authentic.

Never let Yourself down, always rise,<br>
and do not slow down.

Step after step jog mightily forward,<br>
decorate Your Beautiful Journey with Wisdom and Triumph.

<br><br>

May Your elder self, perch upon a porch,<br>
and muse and wonder...

"What a strange Star Child I was,<br>
and how impossibly long my Beautiful Life"

And may You bring Her memories,<br>
of every year in each decade.

Of things You noticed for the first time,<br>
and things You never knew could happen.

And things, that other people never expected of You,<br>
like that year, that you wore a bushy tail - because it made you feel beautiful.

<br><br>

Love Your older self,<br>
make Her smile and wonder.

Make Her love the Younger You,<br>
but fill in all the years completely.

Make sure, that not only is there nothing new to add,<br>
but also that there is nowhere anything could fit.
