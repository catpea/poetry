You can't leap into whatever you conceive Enlightenment to be,<br>
it is built layer by layer, step by step, and year by year.

We all need might, never has a creature been alive that didn't need strength,<br>
and waiting until the last moment; is a bad idea, anyway.

That's why people run marathons,<br>
this is why people challenge themselves with practice.

So that when life becomes a challenge,<br>
for all the finish lines they crossed, failure won't cross their mind.

<br><br>

A self challenge, is a practice of strength,<br>
it is good for us.

It is different challenges for different people,<br>
at different places in their lives.

But there is one thing they all have in common,<br>
whatever they set off to do, it seems impossible at first.

That's what the hard parts of life are like,<br>
they seem like an impassible challenge at first.

<br><br>

Practice makes us strong,<br>
difficult challenges help us grow, and help us think too.

It is all for life,<br>
it is all for enlightenment.

It is all for living above the common levels of life,<br>
it is all for knowing that no matter the challenge, we will find a way.

May we all grow wise, and strong, and healthy,<br>
may we each find a mountain to move and inspire a generation.
