My Friends, liars happen, because it is easiest to live on the low,<br>
and never rise, and just hide in the status quo.

That's why we often run into a trouble maker,<br>
it takes no effort to be a faker.

Leave them, to their own stupid little prison,<br>
in their web of lies, there cannot be any reason.

<br><br>

That's our first shaky step in life,<br>
to lean to see who's hiding a knife.

And then cutting with a sword,<br>
and setting ourselves free to move onward.

<br><br>

I promise You, it gets better after this,<br>
the sun will rise, life will become bliss.

With each step we take we find more light,<br>
and baby-step by baby-step, add to our might.

It is as simple as the math of standing-still versus learning,<br>
one goes nowhere, and the other eventually fulfills all yearning.

<br><br>

Walk Your path, don't let the fakers sway You,<br>
look them in the eyes, and see right through.

Choose the real over the fantasy they sell,<br>
and move away from their stupid little hell.

And if someone ever comes pushing You around,<br>
use the might of Your wisdom to push them back, and stand Your ground.

<br><br>

There are so many sweet little treasures within You,<br>
the one You start with will show You heights You never knew.

And the higher You rise the more brightly You will glow,<br>
and You'll find Your Sweetheart, before You know.

Life is meant to be lived in Wisdom and Happiness and Laughter,<br>
Heaven is Right Now - not in some fantasy of after.

<br><br>

All the things that are worthy of the Beautiful You,<br>
will never extract a toll, they will only ever add unto You.

Nobody worthy of You could ever make You feel sad or bad,<br>
they will foolishly trot and prance to Your rescue, until You feel glad.

Don't let fakers trick You into thinking the world is blue,<br>
The sun, is right over the next mountain, and is already shining for You.
