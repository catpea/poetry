Day Six of Quarantine: Created a New Autogenerative Music Widget and disguised it as an immature [Sciurine](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/sciurine) Urine joke. The technology is extremely advanced. I am for the first time in forever connecting virtual synthesizers through a [Reverb Convolver](https://tonejs.github.io/docs/13.8.25/Reverb). This reshapes the Synthesized Sounds, the synthesizer waveform, into a more realistic sounding instrument. Reverb just about does it, if Commodore 64 came with a decent reverb it would sound amazing, nothing like chiptunes. I have gotten used to breaking up my Generative Music into movements, and the initial song comes with 24 measures, where evey eight measures I do something interesting with the higher pitched instruments. For the most part I fell like using A Basic [Arpeggiator](https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js/wiki/Arpeggiator) for everything, I am yet to test it with real world sound samples (digital sound recordings as opposed to synthesizer based sounds.)
