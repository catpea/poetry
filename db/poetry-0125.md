Great Adventures need not take you far,<br>
and ultimately, wherever you go there you are.

But still, there **is** something special about new places,<br>
we see more deeply, and get in good graces.


I think the kind of adventure, that **really** is the best,<br>
will make you start keeping a little journal to document your quest.

When there is time to think about all the things and little bits,<br>
even the slightest curiosity will bring about new wits.


So fill all the journal pages, and leave it for later,<br>
because you never know when a little journal may become something greater.

It could come as a surprise that this little adventure you took,<br>
turned you into a Famous Writer and became your first Adventure Book!
