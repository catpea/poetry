Don't just move forward,<br>
you have to move up!

Life is too short,<br>
You are too Noble,<br>
Truth is too Dear.

Many give away their Time,<br>
some even give away Trust.

Sometimes, because they are tired,<br>
because they had enough,<br>
or had waited long enough.

Giving something of yourself away,<br>
will not make that other person Nobler.

And you are not supposed to wait,<br>
in waiting all your life will pass you by.

<br><br>

You are supposed to learn,<br>
you are supposed to move,<br>
you are supposed to shine.

<br><br>

You will lose your mind if you do noting,<br>
and You will lose your self, unless you grow up.

You'll never lose the ability to turn around,<br>
and try again, it maybe harder if you wait too long...

... but in your waiting,<br>
you'll become tougher too.

No, there is no point of no return,<br>
but all those who rise, would agree:

"Do it sooner than later".

<br><br>

Begin, by taking back what you have given away,<br>
and permanently and meaningfully so, and rise up.

There is no art to this,<br>
you just pick yourself up, and go.

You're going to need running shoes,<br>
and your first battle will be with Fatigue.

Be good to yourself,<br>
strive to be better,<br>
let your body rest enough so it may grow stronger.

And return to point Zero,<br>
go all the way back.

Of all the noble things within You,<br>
not a single thing is to be shared unearned.

And listen carefully, to the words spoken to you,<br>
by inference re-construct that which drives others.

And find the Kindred, and the Kin,<br>
do not be alone for too long.

Isolation is as bad as Fatigue,<br>
it is a state of having fallen, and being lost.

You are To Thrive,<br>
You are To Grow.

<br><br>

Keep searching, keep training,<br>
stay away from hate, and those who fell behind on growing up.

Keep learning,<br>
keep moving,<br>
let yourself shine.

<br><br>

Nothing important in life is found at the foothills,<br>
you have to get to the mountains, and carry on climbing.

Do not stop,<br>
and keep moving up.

<br><br>

As to what it is all for,<br>
it is to better yourself.

To rise above yourself to new thoughts,<br>
and powers, and insights, and observations.

If you stay at the foothills,<br>
you will never really know who you truly are.

Never know the extent of your Might,<br>
your Unbrekability, your Blinding Light.

If you stay down,<br>
you will blend with all the new people coming and going.

You'll never be known, never be recognized,<br>
you may even become forgotten, your judgment clouded.

It will be hard to recognize,<br>
the Kindred from the Foe.

<br><br>

You must rise up, and find your self,<br>
so that you may be seen for the Brilliant Being that really are.

<br><br>

Help us learn from you,<br>
from what you have been through,<br>
from your Great Battles and Works,

If you hide,<br>
the Universe will become darker for it.

We need your light.
