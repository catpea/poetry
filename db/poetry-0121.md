No worries, the only real darkness is the Twilight of Hesitation,<br>
it is dangerous because it makes time go by all too fast.

So you just have to make a promise to your self,<br>
that each day will be a tiny-tiny itsy-bitsy better; than then previous.

Other than that, no cloud could ever stop the sun from rising,<br>
nothing can endanger your brilliance, there is nothing to fear.

<br><br>

And brilliance,<br>
brilliance leads to enlightenment.

So as long as you protect your light,<br>
know that wisdom is your right.

Never stand still and always take to flight,<br>
yours is enlightenment, the brightest of light.

<br><br>

Never has there been a night,<br>
that was wasn't lit by light.

Never has there been a fight,<br>
that wasn't won by wisdom's might.

Rise, rise in spite of the fright,<br>
rise to no end in sight.
