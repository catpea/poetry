Audio Books, Video Lectures, Internet Lectures and Video Tutorials,<br>
are all extremely important for our heath, healing, and well being.

<br><br>

One interesting way to start,<br>
is Travel and Adventure books.

All the top rated books by [Bill Bryson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Bryson) are fun and frequently funny,<br>
his [A Short History of Nearly Everything](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Short_History_of_Nearly_Everything) is a great start to really learning about science.

I recommend his little [Notes from a Big Country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notes_from_a_Big_Country),<br>
it is all extremely positive, funny and interesting.

[Charles Kuralt's America](https://www.audible.com/pd/Charles-Kuralts-America-Audiobook/B002UZL5BG) is another little adventure book that comes to mind.

<br><br>

As with any fun book there is no specific knowledge to transfer,<br>
just the parts that we never got to ourselves.

Beautiful moments and experiences that somehow make us better,<br>
observations that help our imagination and dreams.

A Short History of Nearly Everything along with ten or so other top Science Popularizer Books,<br>
will absolutely expand our view of the universe and contribute to positive changes in our life.

There are also books about Jogging like "Born to Run",<br>
or "Ultramarathon Man" which teach about endurance and every day athletes.

<br><br>

Audio Books and Video Lectures,<br>
are a fantastic source of Wisdom and Adventure.
