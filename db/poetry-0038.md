Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Thirty Three.

Days pass by quickly, but as all the clocks tick away,<br>
we mustn't keep our minds at bay.

We each have extraordinary powers,<br>
and we can expand our knowledge,<br>
in just a few hours.

All it takes is a video lecture,<br>
or maybe an audio-book,<br>
you don't even have to look.

Hours add up, day by day,<br>
building, a new passageway.<br>
It is knowledge that sets us free.

And our inheritance from great beings,<br>
is the key.

We mustn't forget, that everyone needs to learn,<br>
not merely listen, but break out of their prison,<br>
and rise to greatness, when theirs is the turn.

It is within us, that each great being should return,<br>
it is how the world grows, it is how you get your turn.

So, rise to their height, inherit their might,<br>
shine the brightest of light,<br>
yours is the future, yours is the fight.
