Your Lifeline - the cumulative choices you made that affected your entire life,<br>
must be precisely aligned to match who you are, so that you may learn.

This is not an easy thing,<br>
but there can be no other.

<br><br>

We live in a world under constant erosion from Poverty,<br>
Authenticity is a difficult path.

Stay safe, love yourself,
but you must also stand your ground.

<br><br>

What life is pressing you into,<br>
and the path that you must be on for your wisdom sake;

Are likely to be some distance apart,<br>
this is the tragedy of our modern age.

The complexity of life, will be pushing you away,<br>
from the line you need to walk to learn and become wise.

<br><br>

The path that life is trying to press you into,<br>
is almost truly random, it comes out of misery and chance.

The path mere life dictates includes lies and manipulations that you can't see at first,<br>
people will use your innocence against you, to make their lives simpler.

When you follow, you fall into cogs of ravenous emergent machinery,<br>
and this machinery exists, because, followers gather.

<br><br>

My Dear Friends, if you must,<br>
then know that there is but one you serve.

The Wisest You, The Best You, The Most Brilliant You,<br>
at the Greatest Age of Your Life, Your Golden Age of Wisdom.

<br><br>

The path that mere life dictates, is a melody out of tune,<br>
you become a piano key, and life will keep pushing, non-stop.

<br><br>

But the path you dictate, is very unusual in deed,<br>
because each step you take, adds to the previous.

And with only a few steps,<br>
you are stepping higher, you are already building, up.

That is the same "up", that "Grow Up" uses,<br>
your own step, followed by you own step, forward and up.

<br><br>

If you dare to throw caution into the wind,<br>
it will bring you wisdom - you'll see.

But other than that, like a cat,<br>
walk cautiously onward.

<br><br>

When things start adding up,<br>
you will surpass your younger self.

And now, where you used to think: "And where am I actually going?",<br>
you will see a road ahead, by subtle analogy to the road you've already traveled.

Where once you toyed with the question of "Who am I?",<br>
you will now, see you.

<br><br>

You'll make little mistakes, and that is OK,<br>
because you will have your path to fall back on.

And those mistaken tangents, will cradle you,<br>
they will add, and refine your decision-making.

When you walk your own path,<br>
you do not make big mistakes.

The little ones will teach about the bigger ones,<br>
by subtle analogy.

Your own path,<br>
is a great teacher.

<br><br>

So what is it like,<br>
on that path?

I am very sorry to say, it is lonely,<br>
but loneliness is correct.

Not until you find your other half,<br>
will loneliness let go of you.

It is there to remind you,<br>
that you can only make it half-way on your own.

Your own path,<br>
is above all; clear.

There are no excuses,<br>
nothing to sway you.

The air is crisp,<br>
there is no smog.

Just,<br>
a clear vision.

Even without any guarantees in life,<br>
you will become stronger.

But, yes - no matter how beautiful you become,<br>
Universe will do nothing to guarantee you, anything.

This,<br>
is the Leap of Faith.

And the faith,<br>
is in Your Greater Self.

<br><br>

Walk your own path, because in the first half of your life,<br>
your own path is the only thing that can add to you.

Authenticity, is a law of the Universe,<br>
it follows similar principles.

Walk your own path,<br>
and expand.

<br><br>

The first steps are always clumsy,<br>
I went to the museums.

A coffee shop is a bad idea,<br>
because everyone is there.

But a museum is different,<br>
it filters for kindness, somehow.

I went to the D.I.A<br>
I was extremely lucky.


They were showing,
Auguste Rodin's work.

I understood it immediately, the secret of sculpture,<br>
is to enlarge that part that holds the soul.

At the end,<br>
they had The Waltz (possibly a large replica as it had more detail, this was some 13 years ago), that dancing couple by [Camille Claudel](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camille_Claudel).

I started crying,<br>
her hand, had so much feeling in that gentle arch, there was so much touch.

That is life,<br>
that is the path.

The path, where you cry out of beauty,<br>
and not cry out of being lost.

<br><br>

And you have to create art,<br>
art is about training yourself for success.

Learning,
by subtle analogy.

That's why you never finish,<br>
there is no time for the art it self.

There is only time,<br>
for learning life.

Learning by subtle analogy,<br>
to the smaller Triumph, and Success.

Stick to a single subject,<br>
until you fill it completely.

Now you can hang it up at the coffee shop,<br>
but keep moving forward.

<br><br>

Do not Follow, My Friends,<br>
there is nothing there to be found.

Nothing you find when you follow,<br>
will add together to make a whole.

When it feels like you are surrounded by paths,<br>
and there is nowhere to go, or you can't go into enough places.

That is an illusion,<br>
all those paths are false.

Turn around,<br>
slow down.

Go back to the last thing that _moved_ you,<br>
and fearlessly resume at that point.

The world may shake and shudder,<br>
and there will be "Why?", and "How could you?", and "What is going on?".

All those cries,<br>
are for the person that follows.

Each asking you to a different path,
and all those paths are mutually incompatible.

Do you see,<br>
life wants you to merely be.

But you _can_ be more,<br>
you don't have to call it Growing Up, Courage, Authenticity or Growing Content of Character.

Call it, and appointment at D.I.A.<br>
call it, a meeting at the UofM Museum of Natural History.

Begin keeping a Moleskine Journal,<br>
use a pencil,<br>
only draw what your heart sees,<br>
and write as little as possible,<br>
write to your older self,<br>
explain to her why?

Find your center,<br>
find your balance.

Lean on your Nucleus,<br>
and push off to take your steps in your own direction.

<br><br>

Calm your hand,<br>
slow your time.

There are decades ahead,<br>
and you have to be seen.

Show yourself,<br>
create future.

<br><br>

What others have, may shine,<br>
but is not always gold they keep.

The younger we are,<br>
the less wisdom we hold;

The less wisdom,<br>
the more questions we should answer.

And questions combined with life,<br>
make for a busy time in deed.

So slow down,<br>
answer your questions - first.

<br><br>

All life is sacred,<br>
all Lifelines equally matter.

But not all will arrive at their Golden Age of Wisdom,<br>
without regrets.

So, please,<br>
ask your older self what her regrets are.

And the higher you grow, the more you know, and which is more,<br>
the more in harmony with your older-self, you'll be.
