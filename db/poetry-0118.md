Back when I was a Teenager,<br>
one late Friday afternoon.

I had a nap, so amazing,<br>
I have never forgotten about it.

I woke up light as a feather,<br>
and I dressed beautifully.

And went exploring,<br>
little Coffee Shops in Plymouth.

I went to see The Brew Ha Ha,<br>
full of Mighty Minds with Extreme Dreams.

I peeked into Coffee Studio,<br>
and saw Angel-headed Hipsters reading Tolstoy.

I poked into The Bean,<br>
full of Dirty Hippies, reciting Beautiful Poetry.

I made my way back home,<br>
walking alone through streets of gold.

I read Chaucer,<br>
programmed Visual Basic.

And went back to sleep,<br>
full of new memories that I would keep.
