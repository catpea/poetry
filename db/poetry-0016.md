Captain's Log, Day Twelve of Quarantine.

I ordered some trail-mix from the internet, mailman dropped it off by the door.

And all the local Squirrels I've been feeding came over

They ripped the box open, and ate it all without me.

How rude, I probably shouldn't have been feeding them all this time.
