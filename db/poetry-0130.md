Without learning we cannot grow up,
and without teaching the world cannot progress.

<br><br>

It does not matter where you start your journey,
be it top of the world, or the very bottom, or somewhere in the middle.

Wherever you start, you must immediately begin moving forward,
step after step, find what moves you, use it to grow up.

Grow to create a solid thought, or dream, or aim, or understanding,
and get on top of it, and start building the next thing.

The road to catching up with everyone else is very short,
once you are there, like everyone else, you take off in your own unique direction.

<br><br>

We must let go of beginnings and ends,
and questions of lengths of road we must travel.

We must let go of things that we can't finish in time to enjoy life,
empires ought be build by generations of visionaries, not a single inspired being.

We must put majority of our existence towards a happy meaningful life,
not struggle, or war, or fear, but simple meaningful beautiful happiness.

<br><br>

We must not forget about the importance of Meaningful and Enlightening Education,
the world is not able to give all a safe home but we can learn to build one.

And once we learn, and find peace in life,
we should consider becoming teachers.

<br><br>

By teaching people, by giving them the right tools, by helping them see how to accomplish great deeds,
we also grant them the path, to get where they will bloom at their healthiest, and thus Find Hope.

Inadequate education is one of the greatest barriers to a healthy existence,
but it is also the **weakest** barrier, as it is removed with simple audio-books.

We should encourage people to search for best selling non fiction,
and inherit both Lessons, and the Culture of Successful Great Beings.

<br><br>

All the problems we face are Human Problems, and thus the solution is in Our Hands,
as humans we know that the source of our Powers is in our Minds.

That is where must begin our Lives,
by making our minds Strong, Noble, Authentic, Unbreakable; Dignified.

Let the self correcting nature of inheritance of knowledge from all our Beloved Great Beings,
be the start of our battle against all the problems that plague our Civilization and Cultures.

<br><br>

Without wisdom all serious problems bear negative consequences,
consequences that help to multiply problems until there seemingly seems to be no solution in sight.

But that is an illusion,
instead of building more prisons to contain minds sickened by poverty, let us teach meaningful wisdom.

We must learn to prevent minds from fracturing, and from getting lost, and from not growing up,
we must build a better world for all.

<br><br>

To build a better world we must fearlessly challenge ourselves to success,
to wisdom, to knowledge, to noble pursuits of excellence.

And then boldly teach,
all the lessons that moved us.
