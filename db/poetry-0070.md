Wherever I went, Friday magically followed,<br>
there always seem to have been a tree that was hollowed,

And the moment I looked at food,<br>
he knew, dinner was going to be good.

Wherever the Raccoons came out at night,<br>
Friday, was always there, my Fat Spirit Guide.

<!-- Keys -->
Over at Little Torch Key, at Veterans Beach, with easy access to water,<br>
he lived up a Palm Tree, with his Furry Wife and Tiny Daughter,

Once I got lonely, and threw a little Tortilla all the way up there,<br>
he popped up, and it looked like he smiled - I swear.

<!-- Jack Pine -->
Over at Ludington State Park, at the Jack Pine Hike-in Campground,<br>
I woke up at 3 am, hearing a strange sound.

He was trying to pull out my hamburger buns,<br>
probably to feed all his furry sons.

The bag was tied, up in a tree,<br>
nothing could stop him - Because he was free.

I got out of my tent, and delivered his late night bite,<br>
by tossing it into my cranky neighbor's camp site.

<!-- Nordhouse -->
The whole woodland family, knew that eventually I had to go back,<br>
Friday left a little footprint on my pillow, to help me pack.

I was staying up in the trees, on top of ancient dunes,<br>
the only light was that of stars, and the moon's.

I called them [Nordhouse Skylands][1],<br>
but, if you go out there, be ready for his smart little hands,

Bring a travel lock to secure the zippers on your tent,<br>
and remember, Friday loves you as friend, he means no ill intent.

My Dear Readers, we may each need a few weeks of Wilderness in our life,<br>
so start slowly packing, buy a backpack, bug spray, and a knife,

And just keep your adventure pack by the door,<br>
if life ever gets you down, smile! and head for that Lake Michigan shore.

You can park at the [Nurnberg Trailhead][2],<br>
and don't forget to bring a little bit of stinky cheese,<br>
and piece of stale bread.
