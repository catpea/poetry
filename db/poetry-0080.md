[Visit The Research Post][1] that explains the program behind this little poem.

I wrote a new workout program, Holy Molly,
surely this will turn out to be another folly.

It will make me jog fast like lightening,
I think a lot of people will find my wobbles very frightening.

Certainly it will make me dance in the streets,
as I shuffle and jog to my favorite beats.

And it already crossed my mind to jog with a tail,
but I don't want all the quarantined people to go even more pale.

I just executed the program and it said: play-list done,
so I am already stretching my drumsticks for the run.

The play-list is several hours long,
it will surely make me very strong.
