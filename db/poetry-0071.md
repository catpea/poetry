Like steps on a mountain, each epoch stands in support of the next,<br>
like the pages of a journal, together, they hold the sacred text.

We learn, we may fail, or triumph, and the next epoch follows,<br>
but every new epoch grows from the one previous.

We can't leap from one place to another,<br>
we can only move up, or graduate up, or build up, or step up.

To leap, is to stay a child in an aging body,<br>
to go up, to grow up, and carry on to no end, is to become an adult.

<br><br>

In our youth we must learn to stand our ground,<br>
and anchor ourselves to something that moves us.

As we age, having followed that path,<br>
we'll be standing upon our own mountain,

A great mountain of personal wisdom,<br>
where once only a direction lay.

These mountains rise with each epoch in our life,<br>
every once in a while we pause, to bring all that we are together - higher.

Epoch by Epoch, we ascend, we can already see the sunshine,<br>
but our journey comes with no end.

<br><br>

This is a simple life, first we conform and then break away,<br>
we become wise, and later in life, our wisdom transforms into Enlightenment.

It is a road of Adventures, Books, Poems, and Inspirations,<br>
it has tears of sadness, but in return we grow stronger.

What it is all for, is to Live a Life of Simple Dignity,<br>
or rising when we fall, of learning when we get tricked.

Of protecting our bodies and minds, and growing stronger,<br>
of adding to our existing body of wisdom.

<br><br>

With each epoch we climb over what we previously thought were our limits,<br>
As we get up, and stand up, we reach a new plateau.

We rest, we take in the sun of this new height,<br>
and get busy building higher, and higher.

None of us begged to be born, we were nothingness,<br>
and temporarily all these atoms came together to give us, ourselves.

And eventually, we'll return to our nothingness,<br>
and the atoms will disperse, to become parts of other beautiful things,

<br><br>

While we are in this state, however, the first and foremost order!<br>
...is to Thrive, to Grow, to Expand, to Rise, to Build, and to Ascend.

Whether we know it yet or not, the road that we are on, is one.<br>
It is the same road that our 90 year old selves will wonder about.

They will go up and down the Epochs, and ask questions.<br>
there will be some regrets, but we do have a chance to solve them now.

There will be enough triumph to bring blinding light to all the sadness,<br>
and the beautiful memories will wipe out all the unimportant things.

<br><br>


All that stands in the way of our growing up,<br>
must be pushed aside, growing up is our life.

We must grow up, rise up, all the way up.<br>
Each and every epoch ahead, demands this.

Our minds require wisdom, wisdom fuels our decision making,<br>
and our choices dictate all our life ahead.

Life is precious, it is to be lived in Dignity and Authenticity,<br>
and you are meant to become a Great Being.
