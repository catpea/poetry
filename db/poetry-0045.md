Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Forty.

Everything is all right, except for our flight.<br>
But had we been given infinite light,<br>
our wings would fail in flight.

What gives us the right to learn, and rise to height,<br>
is the limit of the duration of our light.

What makes it precious, and worth the flight,<br>
is precisely the limits in duration of our light.

It is by our limits that we look to light,<br>
had we been given infinite flight,<br>
our intelligence would fail to light.
