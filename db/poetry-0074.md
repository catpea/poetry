It was a very rainy day,<br>
the sky was completely gray.

I took a nap come afternoon,<br>
fell into my bed with a big swoon.

I woke up rested, and ran to the door,<br>
but it only seemed to rain more.

<br><br>

I resumed my endurance training a week back,<br>
It was a warm-up week, so I ran like a Mac truck.

I actually sprinted yesterday,<br>
somewhat frightening myself along the way.

I felt like I was all muscle,<br>
I moved like red lightening, without a hustle.

<br><br>

Even though yesterday I ran in the rain,<br>
I rained only a bit, so I had to train.

Today, the rain seemed like too much trouble,<br>
I rested, tomorrow I have to train double.

I always tell people not to rest,<br>
let Mother Mature decide, she knows best.
