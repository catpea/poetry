The only thing keeping us back, is lack of wisdom,<br>
this is occurring because the world places no emphasis on becoming wise.

Without wisdom we can't even tell if education is real or not,<br>
...the mark of a real education are real results.

Without wisdom we can't tell what real results even are,<br>
without wisdom we begin repeating old mistakes.

People say fake news - nope,<br>
but it is actually the fake education...

<br><br>

Real education, helps a person become Wise and Noble,<br>
Triumphant, Successful, Strong, Unbreakable.

In the real world no one ever celebrates graduation,<br>
because Real Education is about a Dignified, Realistic Success.

If all students get is a Diploma and a Laboratory,<br>
or even Debt and a job they didn't need a University for.

<br><br>

It is just a waste of time,<br>
and time is priceless.

<br><br>

The central component of Real Education is Joy,<br>
and satisfaction, and a sense of progression, and the undoing of the threat of poverty.

But without wisdom, it is hard to define poverty,<br>
or satisfaction, or even what joy is supposed to mean in context of education.

Without wisdom, we are easily tricked that memorization has something to do with education,<br>
we are easily tricked that confusion is just us not being good enough.

<br><br>

Memorization, is a cheap trick used by worthless teachers,<br>
to pretend that they are doing something.

And by memorizing you make them appear legitimate,<br>
you make them produce grades, and appear as teachers.

And that confusion is there because their lectures make no sense,<br>
the text books probably don't make much sense either.

<br><br>

There is no conspiracy,<br>
it is just people trying to fake it until they make it.

Many do have lessons they could teach you,<br>
and just as many will keep them to themselves.

Just to appear smarter someday, or just out of spite,<br>
"Why should I tell them, it is not in the text book".

<br><br>

Lack of wisdom will keep a teacher, childlike,<br>
keep them thinking "this is just a job", "it is us versus them",<br>
and that usual "I hate them", or "hate my job".

There are good teachers out there,<br>
but for all their goodness,<br>
they know deep down in their hearts.

That it is easier for you to learn on your own adventures,<br>
Then for them to try to help you understand what they know.

<br><br>

Learning is very intimate, and teaching what one knows is taking that intimacy,<br>
and trying to reshape it for strangers.

Almost by definition this takes away all the passion,<br>
all the value of the lessons.

<br><br>

Good Teacher,<br>
may just be an Oxymoron.

It is your life, it must be your own path of discovery and self betterment,<br>
no one can help you through this.

Learning languages, is something we do naturally,<br>
not by memorizing but by becoming submerged in the language; by actually needing it for survival.

If you want to learn French,<br>
head for the Colonies, inhale the language, don't memorize it.

Learning mathematics, is similar, you don't do it by memorization,<br>
in Real Mathematics same symbols mean different things based on context and author.

To learn Math, you start in the beginning,<br>
and slowly trace its development across Empires and centuries.

Whatever it is You Have To Love It,<br>
can you imagine loving every mathematician?

Because that's what it takes to learn Math for real,<br>
or Physics, or Chemistry, or Biology, or Astrophysics.

Now imagine trying to teach a stranger,<br>
what you have learned, but without the love that you have personally felt for it.

Oxymoron.

<br><br>

Being good at Biology, Dancing, Medicine, Trail Running, Math, Electronics, Art, Computers, Music,<br>
still means little.

We get good at things we like,<br>
it is not a big deal to be good at something.

<br><br>

Being Wise, is a Big Deal,<br>
being able to Authentically and Nobly navigate live in a Dignified Fashion.

With wisdom, we can figure out how the world works,<br>
the World is not a Mechanical Machine, now will it ever become a Political One,<br>
it is a Conundrum of Human Conditions.

All else must yield,<br>
it must.

It must,<br>
until you are touching the fabric of the future with your very own fingertips.

Until,<br>
you feel like a hero.

Until it is your voice, and your soul, and heart, and your works,<br>
and your strength.

That make him, rise,<br>
with certainty of knowing, you are correct.

Tired old man,<br>
who has seen everything and heard every lie.

He's been a District Judge for more than he can remember,<br>
but he has heard every world yo said.

And the moment you mentioned,<br>
that it is Human Rights Day, he groaned.

And he stood downstairs,<br>
keeping his hands warm with a cup of coffee.

And he stood there much longer than you could,<br>
and it marked the end of his career.

But he never forgot your words,<br>
because your words were filled with wisdom.

Because you searched for it,<br>
because you fought for it.

Because you were courageous,<br>
it all became crystal clear in your mind.

And more than moving a single judge,<br>
you will grow to move a generation.

Grow to renew the search for meaning,<br>
the Love of Wisdom.

You moved mountains,<br>
you gave speeches long past your retirement.

As the cities of the future grew,<br>
and as you grew.

And the life of wisdom made it so,<br>
that your name and the symbols it stood for earned permanence in Human History.

<br><br>

Wisdom, is your right,<br>
it is your first fight,<br>
it is your greatest might.<br>

Rise my friend,<br>
rise to no end,<br>
the world needs you to set the trend.
