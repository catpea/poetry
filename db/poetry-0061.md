[Listen](audio/poetry-0061.mp3)

If you don't care about yourself,<br>
People will get scared of you.

Because, if you get hurt,<br>
you will hurt them too.

You have to watch yourself,<br>
be compassionate to yourself.

<br><br>

Ask...

Is working too many hours a day,<br>
helping or harming me?

Are Office Walls,<br>
helping or harming me?

Does loneliness help you?<br>
Or does it harm you?

Same for getting scared,<br>
Does hiding really help you?

<br><br>

Overwork and Office is unhealthy,<br>
take those skills, and [build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoqgAy3h4OM).

Take it [outside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68jy3_ABvRo),<br>
let Nature nurture you.

In her silence,<br>
she will help you remember who you are.

You must learn to treat your body with compassion,

You must learn to take Great Care of our mind.

And please,<br>
make every day count.

We are so beautiful,<br>
such powerful dreamers.

Above All,
Love Yourself.
