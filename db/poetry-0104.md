Authenticity would be Wonderful on its own,<br>
it helps with trust, admiration, knowing, feeling.

But, actually, it is far more than that,<br>
it reflects Fundamental Principles of The Universe.

There is a very big difference, between crossing a real bridge,<br>
and a fake one.

Or, reading a book for real, and pretending to read.<br>
Or, studying a Field of Science and, and cramming for a test.<br>
Or, doing something for a grade, and doing something for your mind.<br>
Or, doing something for real, and pretend to do something.<br>
Or, being your complete self, and being what others approve of.<br>

The one thing in common here, is one is a fantasy that ends,<br>
and the other, just is ... and grows, and alters the course of life ahead.

It is a testament to our connection with the Universe,<br>
that an Authentic Human Being will grow Healthy and Strong, and Keep Expanding.

The best example of this is getting an education that looks great on paper,<br>
but does nothing for interacting with the real word.

A similar example has to do with a great job that pays well, that goes great,<br>
but halts a person's development, and robs them of their youth, dreams, and hopes,<br>
robs them of the highest version of themselves.

Time, cannot be warped, or faked,<br>
it ticks away, our bodies grow, day by day, year by year, decade by decade.

The long-vision of becoming of ourselves, will reveal that the first and foremost,<br>
and most dominant and meaningful thing, is our acquisition of wisdom.

Acquisition of Wisdom is deeply connected to Authenticity,<br>
Courage, Dignity, Nobility, Pursuit of Knowledge, Rising, Growing Up.

Time helps our bodies progress forward,<br>
but it is Wisdom that helps our Minds.

Authenticity, gives us this incredible power to start something today,<br>
that will make us Wiser, Healthier, Happier, Filled with More Insight.

And not merely tomorrow, but for all our time to come,<br>
as in Authenticity, each day adds to the previous.
