My Friends, it is very important not to think in terms of Others running the world,<br>
whoever holds the power now, will be too old in a handful or years.

The world is yours, but it is nowhere near ready,<br>
it needs great ideas, a lot of work, and it comes with many challenges.

The world you have been born into is not a static masterpiece,<br>
but rather, it is constantly hoping for you to help it grow.

You are the Hope and the Dream of past generations,<br>
it is your responsibility to grow all the way up and continue and improve the work of Great Beings.

<br><br>

We Grow,<br>
by reaching out for Knowledge and Wisdom.

This also means that when we are young, we are yet to gain the necessary Knowledge and Wisdom,<br>
The content of character required for the correct decision making that will do justice to our elder selves.

This means we need to take time to prepare ourselves for Life,<br>
we have to make careful observations, and carefully capture all the worthy wisdom.

We have to recognize that when lacking life experience,<br>
we are other than we should be.

There is a solution practiced by all the world's greatest minds,<br>
it is the unrelenting pursuit of knowledge and wisdom.

For thousands of years it has been proven method,<br>
to help us become who we need to be to do our elder selves justice.

We have no choice but to expand our minds with Knowledge,<br>
and enlarge our worlds with Love of Wisdom.

<br><br>

The World Grows,<br>
by means of informed decision-making.

Mislead or Uninformed decision-making is a Human Problem,<br>
and all Human Problems, have Human Solutions.

We have connected all the nations with internet,<br>
we have created the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights).

We have witnessed the creation of European Union,<br>
countries that speak different languages.

All the world accepted standardized schooling,<br>
as a standard that we all follow.

We have come a long way,<br>
towards Wisdom and Peace.

<br><br>

Time has come to make better use of these amazing advancements,<br>
and to hasten our pace of development as One Human Family.

We face common problems that require an Informed and United World,<br>
we have made many mistakes in the past 100 years, and we have learned much.

We can no longer see ourselves as invisible parts of our little neighborhoods,<br>
we must now rise to the challenges of becoming a Citizen of The World.

<br><br>

We must grow beyond the need for our own Knowledge and Wisdom,<br>
onward to making Meaningful and Lasting Contributions towards helping the world become more mature.

We can no longer serve, as we are not heartless and soulless cogs in a blind machine,<br>
we must now rise to question, judge, evaluate, challenge and fearlessly stand for wisdom.

<br><br>

In all of Human History we never lost sight of Family, Peace, Wisdom, and Love,<br>
not for a day, not for a moment.

Every day of human history pushed to become better than the previous,<br>
and any fractures that occurred have had the global community come together in hopes of repairs.

Let us hasten our pace with an aim that none suffer for any reason,<br>
be it hate, punishment, arrogance or ignorance.

Where we cannot fix something, let us use the power of time,<br>
and either prevent new fractures before they begin,<br>
of establish benefits for those born after a certain year in the future.

Let us never leave a chain-link unlined,<br>
there is not to be a courtroom without a meaningful force of prevention and rehabilitation on each side.

There is not to be a war,<br>
where it could have been prevented with education, knowledge and wisdom.

<br><br>

Let us make sure that all generations from now on, know with certainty and understanding,<br>
that their first step in life - and the true rite of passage - is the acquisition of wisdom,<br>
and capacity of decision-making worthy of their elder selves.

Above all, we must remind the children with Knowledge and Science,<br>
that they are a Child of The Universe first.

And with History,<br>
that to them belongs the future.

That they are to reject the status quo,<br>
because what was well enough for the previous generation,<br>
now needs improvement to do the current one justice.
