[Listen](audio/poetry-0157.mp3)

May all your days add,<br>
may you never feel sad.

Because it is hard to say,<br>
what things may.

We certainly know not,<br>
the world; dot for dot.

What we do know,<br>
is not to resign or live low.

Because life is one,<br>
so live as bright as the sun.

And as wise,<br>
as the true sunrise.

And as smart,<br>
as the unbroken heart.

Growing is your right,<br>
your most magnificent might.

Do not waste not a single day,<br>
and always walk your own way.
