[Listen](audio/poetry-0065.mp3)

Each day we must learn,<br>
and what we've forgotten re-lean.

Our life depends on clarity,<br>
our visions must be sharp.

A lesson learned, begets a wisdom.<br>
Two create a kingdom.

Our might comes from knowledge,<br>
and you can't find that in college.

Life is too short to lean in slices,<br>
leave them to their own devices.

You are a powerful being,<br>
you learn fastest on your own.

As few teachers there are,<br>
so there are but a handful of books.

It will be hard work,<br>
to fill all the notebooks.

But your mind is unique, anyway,<br>
there is no substitute for your own way.

At first it will be gibberish,<br>
at last, they will read it feverish.

You must not be tired,<br>
your mind cannot be stressed.

You must resist what they desired,<br>
tell them you can't be hired.

You are not a dime a dozen,<br>
there is no other like you.

You have to tend to your mind,<br>
all the forgotten lessons remind.

There cannot be anyone like you,<br>
learn to reach your own breakthrough.

Set your self free from the silly sting,<br>
you are not just a little thing.

No retreat, no surrender.
You are a meant to become a Great Being.
