Good to see you, my Enormous Old Friend,<br>
how long has it been now?

You haven't aged a day,<br>
and as promised I grew in Wisdom, and Strength, and I maybe a bit Taller.

I bet they finally fixed that [achy bench](https://www.google.com/maps/@40.7060248,-73.9967572,2a,75y,286.07h,64.46t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sGiVjQ4_lsY3jlLY0PM3KEA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en) on the Manhattan side,<br>
I promise to come sit, some day.

<br><br>

When I came to America,<br>

The Bridge, Lady Liberty, and the Old Twins<br>
kept me company.

We'd sit calmly together,<br>
making excuses and promises.

<br><br>

The New York County Supreme Court was my only other friend,<br>
and I still love her dearly, but we don't speak anymore.

I wanted to be a Judge,<br>
a Philosopher King as I used to think of them - but I think better now.

I think in my old age, I'll come to [her stairs](https://www.google.com/maps/@40.714548,-74.0024396,3a,75y,102.05h,105.41t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1smigFc8sXfFR7X-Jni_7Ogg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?hl=en),<br>
and I will wear my suit,<br>
and I will wear those shoes that the lawyers went up and down the stairs in - back in 96.<br>

I will read her words again,<br>
"THE TRUE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IS THE FIRMEST PILLAR OF GOOD GOVERNMENT",<br>
But if she could speak, I'd ask about Fair Starts, Prevention, and Rehabilitation,  now.

We drifted apart.<br>

<br><br>

I made a little pilgrimage after the Twins Feel,<br>
I went to see if all was healing properly, and it was,<br>
workers were preparing the site for what would become the Freedom Tower.

The city was unchanged,<br>
it was still the same people.

"Home Sweet Home" - I said out of awe and nostalgia<br>
as we turned to see the New York City Skyline framed in the bus window,<br>
"Damn Right" the person next to me muttered.

<br><br>

That broken bench on the Manhattan side,<br>
was my bench, we connected instantly, I was breathless - it is a long walk.

<br><br>

The things I'd ponder about back then were supremely simple.

Like, "When is it going to stop raining", and,<br>
"Will they let me back on the Subway in a coat this wet?"

and I wanted to know more about what Ferris Bueller said;<br>
"Life moves pretty fast. If you donâ€™t stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it."

But it turned out, I'd never let go of a year without trying to learn something new and lasting,<br>
years were always too precious for me, I'd claw at Decembers like a cat going after his favorite toy.

<br><br>

Mostly, I would sit there quietly,<br>
watch the occasional jogger.

Stare at the cars going left and right beneath me, and boats going up and down East River,<br>
I remember always having some sweets on me, the [old bench](https://www.google.com/maps/@40.7060248,-73.9967572,2a,75y,286.07h,64.46t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sGiVjQ4_lsY3jlLY0PM3KEA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en) is a great place for a Picnic.
