Of course,
let us ask what their regrets are...

We are after all the future generation,
to those that came before us.

Therefore we have insight,
and certainly have regrets.

We regret;
wars, poverty, hate and stupidity.

<br><br>

We want World Peace,
because a single Human Life is more Sacred than all the gods put together,
because borders are stupid and war is hell,
because ongoing weapons manufacturing is evil.

We want the End of Poverty,
because money should only be used to help a person and not make them worse,
because no one should be denied mental, dental or medical care,
because not a single Human Being should ever go hungry or thirsty.

We want the Age of Wisdom,
because people must learn how to think before being told what to think,
because the Modern Human being must first catch up with Knowledge in Beloved Books,
because we must put an end to making mistakes that can otherwise be avoided.

<br><br>

The World will not grow if Human Beings are prevented from Meaningful Education.

The World will not grow if People are too scared, or too hungry, or too tired to learn.

The World will not grow, if You, and I, and Everybody Else fails to Honor the Future Generations.

<br><br>

As many evil forces as there are,
they will give up the moment they see that their lies can't move crowds anymore.

<br><br>

Moving against reality,
commits the followers to the forgotten side of history.

Standing up for Truth and Authenticity,
fills us with Light of Wisdom, and Love of Humanity.

<br><br>

You never know,
the first day,
when you become ready,

to reinforce, or add a new article,
to a document that will define Humanity for all Generations.

We can't be sure if this document exist yet,
perhaps you will begin writing it,

perhaps your article will be the opening article,
and yours, the first signature.

<br><br>

There are to many borders, My Friends,
and too often money is being used for harm, where it was invented for good.

Our World, with Our Love and Our Blessing,
must take another Deep and Long Breath,
and Exhale in Blooming Changes all around.

<br><br>

Practice, take out your journal, and scribble to no end,
many high and mighty laws printed over and over on paper will not hold up forever.

Humanity never moved toward some Economic Paradise,
it has always moved towards Goodness and Love.

It has moved slowly, slowed down by poverty of so many,
slowed down by borders,
and people not yet ready to learn how to think before they are told what to think.

But it has moved with unlimited strength,
sanding down to dust all that stood in the path of Good Ideas, and Goodness, and Love.

Do not accept wrongs, on paper, or law, or the red faces of those moving against the grain of reality,
do not assume that the wrongs that stand today, will not be erased tomorrow.

<br><br>

Proudly, nobly, respectfully, deep in thought,
take time off, and reach out to world's best selling non fiction.

My Friends,
May you laugh, may you celebrate, may you admire,
and learn from; and forgive mistakes leaving them to the past.
