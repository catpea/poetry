[Listen](audio/poetry-0142.mp3)

A Powerful Summer Storm approached with mighty thunder and powerful showers,<br>
and as always my power went out for for some twenty four hours.

I love Mother Nature and her Cosmic Powers,<br>
with this much rain there can only be more blooming flowers.



But, yah, as soon as the power went out,<br>
my apartment went completely dark.

My air conditioning was gone too;<br>
I tried to turn on the window fan before I realized "I need to think that one through."



All my extravagantly blinking computers and phones,<br>
either shutdown or chirped their sad little low-battery tones.

I watched the sun go down with a sigh,<br>
and so the only thing left blinking was the smoke detectors and I.
