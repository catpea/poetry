We often think of consequences to mistakes,<br>
but consequence does not pick.

So as long as we keep to our paths,<br>
all our actions cast changes ahead.

In mistakes, lessons await,<br>
in good deeds, we find family.

In great adventure, we'll find mountains,<br>
in great achievements, calm and peace.

In darkness, we will find light,<br>
in isolation, we'll find hugs.

So as long as we keep to our paths.<br>
what we shall find will make us stronger.

<br><br>

However, if we dare so to diverge,<br>
all we have cast we'll be lost.

Perhaps no shadows, but certainly no light,<br>
no lessons, no sweetness, no might.

By switching paths we'll find fewer wisdoms,<br>
and far more things that don't fit us.

We'll also find a force of opposition,<br>
it will keep our minds tired.

It will be unclear why life seems strange,<br>
why everything takes so much more to see.

Why we seem to lack confidence,<br>
or how everyone else has so much of it.

<br><br>

But, the most troubling thing, my Dear Friends,<br>
is in how easy it is to diverge.

There is a place for Leaps of Faith in life,<br>
they are quite sacred, and as beautiful.

But, to fill in a stranger's blanks,<br>
or trust that the others know what they are doing.

To listen to good advice that considers you naught,<br>
or give something up of your self, and not know why.

To go to a place because everyone went there,<br>
to bow because all others bowed.

That is not sacred, sacrilegious maybe,<br>
you must never follow, you must always lead.

<br><br>

Even more troubling is how it all collapses,<br>
not with a bang, but a stupid sick whimper:

"How were they supposed to know",<br>
"How was I supposed to know?"

All the blame for what others did,<br>
to Your Sacred Self, somehow falls back right on you.

And then it turns out,<br>
your lesson is all over cheap paperbacks.

Everyone has been trough this,<br>
and none were the wiser.

All those confident faces and smiles, were faked,<br>
and the more convincing they try to be, the less they are in pain.

<br><br>

When someone is putting you at risk,<br>
take a split second to imagine them saying:

"How was I supposed to know?", and stand your ground.<br>
You are not to follow, you are to lead.

Let them have have their stupid games, and drinks, temporary junk,<br>
you go to the DIA, take some notes, and splurge on clay.

Find a gallery worthy of your works,<br>
resume where Rodin left off.

Instead of filling the blanks,<br>
show the world the shapes.

How can your other half recognize you,<br>
when you are traveling on some other path.

<br><br>

What you many not do, is to start at the bottom,<br>
all those cheap novels, they describe starting at the zero.

Start where all the heroes left off,<br>
read a handful of novels, and move on to their Memoirs.

Your life depends on knowing what it is and where to start,<br>
and what to avoid.

It will get lonely, yes.<br>
You'll be lonely because you don't drink, and don't do stupid things.

You'll be lonely, but, You'll be You,<br>
you will shine your own light, and. you. will. be. seen.

<br><br>

Get up, step up,<br>
create and speak with art, and you'll talk with the world.

Grab pencils, trace with an Office Projector,<br>
and bring your Tortillon along.

At the gym, dance,<br>
your way is the only way.

You may get lonely,<br>
but for long.

<br><br>

Try to help people learn, what you have learned,<br>
become an assistant, a tutor, and a substitute teacher.

Keep track of your Peace Corps application,<br>
just keep adding to it, keep re-sending it.

They probably don't read it until version 50, anyway.<br>
It gives you time to revise and refine the ideas.


To begin walking your own path,<br>
is to enter, The Grand Path of Pursuits of Excellence.

Everything on your own path will add to you,<br>
there will be no limit to how far you can travel.

<br><br>

Stay on your own path, avoid generic advice, read Memoirs,<br>
keep moving up, and always try to move faster.

Learn about new things,<br>
expand your knowledge, every day.

If it is something you don't understand,<br>
find an Audiobook about it.

Stay sharp, stay fit,<br>
endurance training goes well with Audiobooks, and Love of Wisdom.

Others must have no influence on you,<br>
this is not their life, it is your life.

Move at your own pace, and in your own sequence,<br>
make your 90 old self laugh, at how amazing you are.
