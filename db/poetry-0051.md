At the center of our being,<br>
we each have a collection.

It makes us unique,<br>
but we never lose our connection.

As with all things in life,<br>
it is too easy to get lost in strife.

We have to protect what makes us unique,<br>
if you fail, your future will be bleak.

With all things we do,<br>
sometimes the bad guys slip through.

This is what we need courage for,<br>
to look them in the eyes, and slam the door.

The unique collection at our center, is our power.<br>
It transforms, and evolves, hour after hour.

We start with just the Ocean, Skies, Mountains, Stars, Earth and Mars,<br>
maybe Flowers, Gardens, Kittens, Dogs, Horses and Frogs.

But then it grows, call it soul, or spirit, personality or vitality,<br>
it becomes... Beauty, Endurance, Authenticity, Nobility, Love and Dignity.

And it keeps growing, so as long as you Love Yourself,

It creates Leaders, Protectors, Guides, Teachers, Dreamers,<br>
Adventurers, Explorers and Discoverers,<br>
Intellectuals, Humanitarians, Philosophers,<br>
Scientists, Astronomers,<br>
Dancers, Athletes, Bodybuilders,<br>
Chefs, Blacksmiths, and Makers,<br>
Musicians, Poets, Sculptors, Photographers and Filmmakers,<br>
Artists and Designers,<br>
Hackers and Programmers,<br>
Genius...<br>
Visionaries...<br>
Founders....

You have to protect what makes you unique at all cost,<br>
if you start letting go, you will become lost.

And many will come, and many with care and kindness,<br>
and they will try to change you, in their blindness.

You cannot grow up, if you start letting go,<br>
you need an unbroken chain, you need that flow.

You have to learn to say,<br>
that it's either you, the one one who stands and is true,<br>
or you are through.

To grow up, into who you need to be,<br>
is your right, and your dignity.

To let bullies push you around,<br>
is to fail, and falter,<br>
and run aground.

Decades, decades after they are long gone, do not let go,<br>
do not take their turns, do not change your view,<br>
you must aim to become worthy of you.

Whether you believe in Heroes,<br>
on that we are only Human.

It is the same height,<br>
just a maximum of our might.

Push, and stand up, and aim up, and rise,<br>
Open your eyes,<br>
it is the only way to become wise.

Fight for who you are,<br>
because in time,<br>
that fight is also for who you need to be.

For who you need to be,<br>
to be strong and healthy,<br>
and unbreakable and worthy.
