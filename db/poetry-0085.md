Today was my day of rest,<br>
and then I went jogging to run another test.

I got really tired after my run,<br>
but I said "Not until I write my poem, will I be done."

<br><br>

Earlier I wrote a little programs to [make art](https://github.com/fantasyui-com/mockup)<br>
overall it was a really good start.

I woke up at six in the morning,<br>
and jumped out of bed without a warning.

<br><br>

Now the hour nears eleven,<br>
getting into my bed will feel like heaven.

I am not sure how I feel about staying up late to write my rhyme,<br>
but there is something sweet about writing just before bed time.
