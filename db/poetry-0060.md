My friends, as mighty as we are,<br>
we can only do one thing at a time.

Once you take care to choose the big things well,<br>
the one thing before you...

is what the big thing will depend on,<br>
do it well.

<br><br>


Small things will sneak up on you,<br>
and I am so sorry for that.

It is the job of our Teachers to help us,<br>
but today there are very few.

You have to accept the responsibility,<br>
you must fight for wisdom at all cost.

In the absence of teachers,<br>
you must become your teacher, it is your right.

<br><br>

If you fail to educate yourself,<br>
people will use you.

They will use the best of you,<br>
Your Generosity, Your Kindness, Your Might.

They will pay you less,<br>
and trick you to thank them that you still have the job.

They will replace you with younger people,<br>
come your Golden Age, to save a dollar.

Come a tragedy,<br>
they will use it to make you work harder.

<br><br>

All of this is hard to see,<br>
it brings so much relief and pleasure.

It feels so right to choose,<br>
but you are so much more than a worker.

You must ask, if the path that you are on,<br>
is worthy of the Magnificent Being you are.

<br><br>

You are meant to become a Great Being,<br>
you have to climb to see the Big Things.

Even as a Great Being, my friends,<br>
always look to the Big Things.

Do not waste your precious time,<br>
to achieve that which [crumbles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozymandias).

Look towards real things,<br>
things that really last.
