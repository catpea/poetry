Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Twenty Eight,

It's evening and it's late,

Time for another poetic update,

I sit here, and yet again, cogitate.

It actually feels pretty great,

I look forward to my little poetry date.

And I always try to really concentrate,

turn everything off and meditate.

Let all those rhymes percolate.

Let all those words decorate.

Poetry is a universe in self,

it won't always let you write what you are trying say.

I just want to rhyme something funny,

write about weather or how its sunny.

But each poem has a mind of its own,

each one is a kind of a milestone.

There is a thousand ways to get to the end,

but it all depends if the message is,

what you intend.
