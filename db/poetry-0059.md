We must Always wisely choose Maximum over Minimum,<br>
because the minimums will attack our mind and body.

When hoping to live life to the fullest,<br>
we have to choose the big things very carefully.

Health, is an example of a big thing,<br>
everything we do, must stand in support of it.

Time, is a big thing,<br>
everything we do, must count.

We must frequently ask,<br>
"Is this event harming or helping me?"

We must frequently ask,<br>
"Will this matter in six months, or next year?"

We must ask,<br>
"What are the regrets of my older self?"

Because only you can judge yourself,<br>
you must grow in wisdom, and age gracefully.

Do not miss the point of life -<br>
You are meant to become a Great Being.

You are to search and find the Light of Your Life,<br>
and discover a way contribute to Wisdom.
