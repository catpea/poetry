[Listen](audio/poetry-0049.mp3)

Don't let them put you on a school bus.<br>
Tell you parents, school is crazy!

And anyway,<br>
they shouldn't be so lazy.

You will need all the games,<br>
and you memorize _no_ presidential names.

You demand a trip to every national park.<br>
because you will not spend you life in the dark.

You will need every audio-book ever made,<br>
and only then will you go through life unafraid.
