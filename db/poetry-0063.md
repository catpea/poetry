Oh it was cold that morning,<br>
the sudden change came without warning.

![Cold](image/poetry-0063-cold.jpg)

While the sunsets are over the sea,<br>
the sunrise, must rise from behind dunes.

There are no dunes taller than these,<br>
they are ancient, born of frozen seas.

![Mist](image/poetry-0063-mist.jpg)

The deer were the first to rise,<br>
to them belonged the sunrise.

There is a place where the dunes part,<br>
by some unknown art.

The deers come out,<br>
it is their lake, no doubt.

When the sun finally made it,<br>
the warm air rolled down the dune.

The symphony of the ancient forest,<br>
perfectly in tune.

Then the birds rose,<br>
and their breakfast followed.

Two eagles came by,<br>
to keep an eye from the sky.

My beloved Seagull friend and I rejoiced,<br>
another perfect morning.

(My seagull friend's name is Bob.<br>
I called them all Bob.

I had difficulty telling them apart,<br>
but I sure got their names right.

Seaguls, are the kittens of the sea,<br>
and they are all very mighty.)
