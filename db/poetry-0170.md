The present belongs to the current generation,<br>
therefore the current generations can be said to be the most important.

Much is to be said on the subject of the great mistakes of the most recent century,<br>
and just as importantly much is to be said about the mistakes we are repeating.

History books are waiting to be read,<br>
they will help us understand current events across all nations.

To correct things, however,<br>
is much more difficult.

This is because we were born into the world long after things were put in motion,<br>
and the people in charge have not been granted the needed wisdom to understand their role.

To put it simply,<br>
it is too late to teach the blind or corrupt.

Individuals who take part in harming the world, or preventing it from growing,<br>
are too far invested, too long gone to be helped.

And it is a matter of help.

Those who advertise products, that they know cause cancer or other illnesses, are sick, their minds are broken.<br>
they all once had an opportunity to become heroes, but they didn't know it.

I think we can assume, that in most situations,<br>
a human being will choose Goodness over Evil,<br>
unless they lack the Wisdom to tell the difference between the two.

<br><br>

The solution to all out problems is to first understand that we were born too late into all this,<br>
the momentum of Climate Change and Business as Usual, Mass Incarceration and Poverty was too high to be stopped by a singe generation.

But it is hardly a challenge for a Wiser World,<br>
a world that helps children to wisdom so that they can become Great Beings come their middle age.

<br><br>

We can't say the word "poverty" and sound like it is a cruel world,<br>
we have to make it clear that it is a broken world looking for New Heroes, New Intellectuals, and New Leaders.

We can't say the word "prison" and make it sound like that's where bad people go,<br>
we have to show our pain, and speak about how no Human belongs in a cage, how they needed a fair start,<br>
and how prisons can only make a bad person worse.

We can't talk about climate change as something that has no real solution in sight,<br>
but rather we have to say that adults today are not educated well enough, their minds are not great enough to comprehend the scale of the problem.

<br><br>

The world in its complexity, made it so that all of these heartbreaking problems,<br>
double as a challenge, an opportunity to not just grow in wisdom to fix these problems, but to grow in Greatness as well.

The mistakes of today,<br>
when presented as such become an opportunity to help a generation grow far beyond what we perceived as our own limits.

Whenever there is a problem that is too great for a generation,<br>
know for certain that multiple consecutive generations will fix it, in their hard earned wisdom.

My Friends,<br>
this is yet another reason to take to Books and Audio Books,<br>
to study best we can, so that we may teach.

We maybe just a chain link in a world with many problems,<br>
but even a single chain-link keeps it all connected.

Slow down, I know you are working hard,<br>
slow down to a speed that lets you read books,<br>
read, learn, and rise to the challenge of inspiring generations to their greatness, and their destiny as teachers.

<br><br>

The momentum of the mistakes of today,<br>
will lose force in proportion to our ability to inspire the younger generation to greatness;<br>
our ability to show them just how important they are, to the past, the present, the future, how it is all inseparable together.
