![Illustration](image/poetry-0066-illustration.jpg)

We are not robots, to be taught,<br>
we are humans powered by inventive and original thought.

This is why life has no instruction book,<br>
if it did, it could only ever tell us where to look.

For the sake of this poem,<br>
let us image that this book does, exist.

Here is how I imagine it would read,<br>
and let me start with the opening creed:

- If someone is attacking you call for help, until it comes.
- If school is treating you unfairly, go hang out with the Principal.
- You need to build your Content of Character.
- Your Body of Wisdom is a Key To Happiness.
- You Must Grow All The Way Up.
- You are to Become a Great Being.
- You Are Beautiful, You Were Beautiful All Along.

It would point to learn from The Greats<br>
as they managed to lift impossible weights.<br>

It would also say that we are delicate,<br>
and our minds are extremely intricate.

It would add, Hey!<br>
You can not grow up in places that weigh.

You have to find you own place in the world,<br>
and you have to quit doing what you are told.

Above all it would state,<br>
that you are Free,<br>
and Full of Beauty.<br>
and searching for Wisdom is your duty.
