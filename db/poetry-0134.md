While Constitutions and Declarations,<br>
age and get amended, to become other than intended.

Most beloved poetry is writ in stone,<br>
loved and celebrated, and hard to forget.

So, let us write poems to celebrate every era,<br>
and each new idea worthy of us and the modern times.

Humanity has always faced great challenges,<br>
and the greatest challenges moved us the most.

Today, we must fix Education for all,<br>
and it **has to** result in creating Wise Great Minds.

We have to fix World Poverty,<br>
as it too often destroys minds before they can even put up a fight.

And we have to create a clearer picture of the world,<br>
poems that reveal problems before they come into being.

Above all we have to help Young People,<br>
help them to understand the world better.

Help them gain early insight,<br>
so that they are not easily manipulated.

<br><br>

At the very least,<br>
we have to explain;

How borders divide,<br>
and how divided, we are made to fight.

How easy it is to dress ignorance in authority,<br>
how some principals, or teachers, or parents, never cared, and never will.

How poverty is not the fault of the children born into it,<br>
but a mark of broken and immature and selfish politics.

How talent, and genius, and genes are a stupid myth for poor angry little men,<br>
how self education is far more meaningful, and how and noble.

<br><br>

You, my Dear Readers,<br>
You are **full** of Great Ideas.

The things you wish you knew when you were younger,<br>
are more important than you think.

Those are the ideas that will create<br>
unforgettable poetry.

Please, pick up a pencil, pick up a keyboard,<br>
and rhyme or arrange, impress with words, with inspirational letters.

The ideas you hold dear,<br>
make you a philosopher, a poet, and artist.

The ideas you hold dear make you a teacher,<br>
Please, help the world learn.
