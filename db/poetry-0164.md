A legendary creature,<br>
from a winter 17,000 years ago.

Still speaks of Might,<br>
at the Cave of Lascaux.

It was not a hunt,<br>
but a Magical Sight,

It was a Noble Megaloceros,<br>
on a wintery starlit night.

A Family, and a Traveler,<br>
Had to go out and see,

Some, said the titan was as big as a tree,<br>
others imagined him as big as the Baltic Sea.

And the story never gets old,<br>
after 17,000 years, it is still, being told.
