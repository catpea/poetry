I dreamt I was tumbling through time,<br>
and I had no control over which fragments I see.

There was a mother writing a letter to a famous movie star,<br>
she was asking him to stop making movies, because her boy didn't comeback from war.

And it worked,<br>
and she wrote many letters.

There was a lot of shocked artists and actors,<br>
they had no idea how they shaped young impressionable minds.

Boys wanted to go to real war,<br>
to be like the imaginary heroes they saw on TV.

<br><br>

And then I struggled in my dream, because my bullies were clearly ill, they were not all there,<br>
but World's Systems of Justice do not differentiate between the ill and the healthy.

And so a person made permanently ill in their mind by poverty,<br>
is seen equal to a man of knowledge, insight, intelligence.

But the ill have little freedom of choice,<br>
they need therapy, and safety, and good homes, and hope, and dreams.

To punish someone who couldn't grow up, didn't know to learn,<br>
for something that they weren't sure they were doing,<br>
and then to send them to a hopeless place without a hope of healing,<br>
without any hope of rehabilitation... is wrong.

If they can't walk among us, if they are permanently ill,<br>
then build special schools for them, schools that bring hope.

We mustn't punish them more than life already had,<br>
[our humanity depends on everyoneâ€™s humanity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2tOp7OxyQ8).

<br><br>


And I saw Mr. [Pirsig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6IKu2wgm5I) on his motorcycle with his boy,<br>
the wind in his face representing the cutting edge of reality.

He was worried that his Metaphysics is not real philosophy,<br>
it was not going to be taken seriously.

The answers they discovered on road they traveled and experiences they shared,<br>
created the Body of Knowledge that provided them with the forward momentum they needed to move ahead.

I dreamt that Pirsig was just talking bout Authenticity, Nobility and Dignity,<br>
and Knowledge and Wisdom, and Wise Intuition.

He is unafraid to show us how vulnerable Philosophers are,<br>
that all it takes is ideas worth sharing, once or twice.

Anybody can be a philosopher,<br>
we will each be heard.

<br><br>

All these strange fragments added together - to remind us that the World is Not Static,<br>
that it grows, moves, changes, and cares not to stop for things writ on paper.

Advancements in Psychology... the trailer to the movie about Philip Zimbardo work - alone,<br>
should invalidate laws and behaviors previously thought acceptable.

Humanity must grow, our cultures must drive us all forward,<br>
we must never assume that the world we are born into is a masterpiece.

And we must never let ourselves think,<br>
that others are in charge - it is our world, it belongs to us all.

<br><br>

To make informed decisions,<br>
we require knowledge, wisdom, foresight, insight, a sense of belonging.

Without knowledge, we will not be able to see right from wrong,<br>
nor will any of our decisions do our elder selves justice.

Access to well grounded knowledge is not difficult,<br>
internet lectures - alone - may even suffice, but best selling non fiction audio books solve it completely.<br>

<br><br>

Humanity must not fall behind on growing up,<br>
the longer the delay the greater the injustice.

Read and Listen to you books, my Friends,<br>
inherit the lifetimes of knowledge within.

We can't send people to prison without any hope of rehabilitation,<br>
for uninformed decisions that came on a whim.

And we can't allow mere Practice of Law without Functional Rehabilitation,<br>
and above all Meaningful Education and Universal Basic Income that truly lifts people out of Poverty.

<br><br>

We Are The People,
we outgrew borders long ago, we are One Family on a Lonely Blue Earth.<br>

We must learn to catch up with what is worthy of knowing,<br>
we can use Science, or Love, or both, or the Leading Edge of Instinct powered by our Humanity.

But we must continue building this world,<br>
each generation must make improvements and never stop.

Those who stand in power today,<br>
are to soon gracefully surrender to the better wisdom of the new generation.

To preside is to wisely wait whilst the new generation becomes worthy of the position,<br>
and to quietly step down, and put whatever wisdom was discovered to the books of history.

To preside, means not, to continue repeating mistakes because they are on the books,<br>
and therefore one will not be punished.

There are only two sides to history, and only fools think it is the winning and the losing one,<br>
the two sides as seen by future generations is the Wrong One, and The Noble One.

Let us all rise to the challenges of wisdom,<br>
and making lasting and meaningful contributions to the Human Family.

Let us not be lost to the wrong side,<br>
let us not be passed over by the books of history,<br>
let us help wisdom propagate.

Let us stand up to every corner and every challenge,<br>
and let us speak out against the wrong, the mistakes, the incomplete, the unfinished.

Let us not accept half measures, or good enough, or status quo,<br>
or the lowest common denominator minimums that get commited to law books.

Let us remember who we are,<br>
and how Noble The Human Being.

Let us stand upright,<br>
in Authenticity, Dignity, Wisdom and Compassion.
