No one regrets becoming wise,<br>
no adult ever wished to stay a child.

All the grownups,<br>
embrace the powers they developed.

You can see it in the way<br>
they Nobly & Calmly carry themselves.

<br><br>

The time meant for your growing up,<br>
should not be disrupted in any way.

Growing up,<br>
is not as random as it seems.

Your own observations,<br>
will create questions.

Questions will sprout affinities,<br>
and affinities will draw you towards places with answers.

<br><br>

Growing up, begins with simple questions, and simple answers,<br>
but we amass a library of twisty little passages.

Later in life,<br>
we apply those passages other things.

<br><br>

We face the Universe,<br>
and there are consequences to all our actions.

What do we do when the bullies come?<br>
We learn to practice restraint, so that we don't end up the snarling beasts they are.

What do we do, when people belittle us, step on us?<br>
We expand our own sense of Dignity, and Nobility into an Independent Universe free of their flaws and limitations.

And how do we stand up against Isolation, or being Cast Away?<br>
With Unbreakability, Fortitude, Courage and Honor.

The meaning of life?<br>
The meaning of life is always found in Love.

And how do we learn to see and rise and better ourselves?<br>
With Insight; and Foresight; and Understanding; and Authenticity; and Heroism;

<br><br>

My Dear Friends,

Your growing up,<br>
is the very Formation of you.

This is not a process that anyone is allowed to interrupt,<br>
you are not allowed to have anybody step in your way.

It is like learning to walk,<br>
no one is allowed to push you to the ground.

I don't know if there is anything more sacred,<br>
than your growing up.

You must learn to push what is not important away,<br>
you must get comfortable with not following.

And you must stand your ground, or walk your path...<br>
You must, lead.

You must make sure that you rise a little higher each and every day,<br>
and that each day adds to the previous.

Growing Up Is Sacred,<br>
It Is Your Right.
