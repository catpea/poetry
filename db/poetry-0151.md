[Listen](audio/poetry-0151.mp3)

It has been a quarter of a century, but I still remember the sounds of New York,<br>
I can almost hear the busy parks, and cars and the occasional police siren.

I still remember that a slice of New York Pizza across the street,<br>
is one dollar and twenty five cents, I am sure no pizza takes that! amazing anymore.

<br><br>

And, wow, to this day I cannot get over the fact,<br>
that five cents is bigger than ten.

With each passing year I bemoan the injustice,<br>
of December not being the tenth month, and October not being the eight.

<br><br>

While I never had a problem with fractions and the sixteenth of an inch,<br>
glancing 9/16 or 7/8 on a piece of paper, makes me want to begin with a calculator in hand.

I never figured out how to spell the word "W", I know it is written as a letter, but how do you spell it,<br>
and I love that the letter "W" may actually mean Double-U; fantastic.

<br><br>

My biggest problem is with Weather,<br>
as I never really switched to the Fahrenheit scale.

It just shows that you can take a mam out of the metric system,<br>
but you can't take the metric system out of a man.

<br><br>

My reptile brain just accepted somehow that every few months it gets boiling hot outside,<br>
during hot summers, I catch my self staring at my thermometer that extra second longer,

and slowly I go... What the ffffffff.. it is a hundred and five,<br>
shut the FFront door.
