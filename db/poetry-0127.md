When you sense that fear is near,<br>
begin thinking about all the things you hold dear.

Think about how far you have already grown,<br>
how much of what you love used to be scary or unknown.

And do not let anyone try to control you with fear,<br>
they are weak and their mind is already broken and unclear.

<br>

Above all, know the weakness of fear,<br>
all the things in your soul are far more real.

<br>

But do not just close your eyes and let it pass,<br>
turn inward to remember your beauty, strength and class.

Let each time you get scared,<br>
mark a day where you contemplate.

Think about all the little wisdoms you love,<br>
and how much more you learned by standing up when push came to shove.
