[Listen](audio/poetry-0154.mp3)

I woke up early,<br>
dressed barely.

Just enough so that I am not bare,<br>
and jumped on my iron mare.

We set course away from the sun,<br>
and just like that we ran.

Some quarter way through,<br>
we had to turn left towards the dew.

But then the road went straight,<br>
and all the way till the end the ride was great.

The road was long,<br>
and birds full of song.

The wind blew fresh air,<br>
as we flew without a care.

On the way back home the sun was on the rise,<br>
and it blinded my eyes.

But I rode all the way back,<br>
by just following my old track.

And so the mare and I parted,<br>
all before the day even started.

She's packed and ready to go, waiting for sun to rise,<br>
and so we'll ride again as soon as I open my eyes.
