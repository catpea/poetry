Don't take shortcuts,<br>
all shortcuts end abruptly.

You can't pretend,<br>
what you pretend, can't ever become real.

A life without Authenticity,<br>
will forever feel like chaos.

<br><br>

You have no choice, but to Rise,<br>
to Emerge, in Majestic Authenticity.

To build and reinforce your Content of Character,<br>
to pursue Wisdom and Excellence.

To Be You.<br>
To Feel Meaning.

<br><br>

Growing Up has always been a Great Challenge.<br>
it has never been easy.

Growing Up is the first, and foremost, and most important,<br>
and should life crumble, you will rebuild.

<br><br>

Don't worry, you are not wasting time Growing Up,<br>
it matters not how you step forward, just that you do.

The result is the same, Content of Character, Strength,<br>
Joy, Love, Happiness, Adventure, and Foolishness,<br>
to name a few.

<br><br>

Not only is this the only way to live,<br>
but it is also the only way for the World to Learn.

Humans cannot be led outside in,<br>
they must be taught to lead, inside out.

The recipe for your own Growing Up,<br>
is also the recipe for a Wise World.
