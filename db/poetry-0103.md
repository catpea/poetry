My Friends, Build Your Mind,<br>
Build Your Body.

Do not ignore your well being,<br>
you require Blue Skies, Seas, Mountains, Oceans, Lakes, and Forests.

Do not ignore your Body,<br>
it needs care and exercise, and proper diet.

Do not merely hope to get a job,<br>
make companies hope they can hire you.

Do not ignore the Content of Your Character,<br>
spend many great adventures in pursuit of wisdom and insight.

Do not ignore Your Beautiful Heart,<br>
keep rising, keep searching, keep shining.

Build Your Life, like a Sculptor Builds a Sculpture.<br>
Ensure Strength, Beauty, Authenticity, Dignity, Nobility, and Restraint.

And when you run out of strength, and it will happen often,<br>
laugh as you pick yourself up,<br>
and your laughter will connect with the laughter of all the other Great Beings who rose before you.

Your life, is to become a Work of Art,<br>
day by day you must add to it, make it more beautiful.

Our civilizations, cultures, and the world, may not be ready to embrace your growing up,<br>
many will stand in your way, some even with advice that sounds good.

Never follow,<br>
Always lead.

Know that all the steps you take toward wisdom and Enlightenment count,<br>
and you will never regret this journey - as Rising Up, is a Law of the Universe.

All the Great Beings who have risen before you,<br>
had only one regret: "I should have risen faster."

So get up,<br>
and Go!
