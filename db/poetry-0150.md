[Listen](audio/poetry-0150.mp3)

Sometimes I race my bicycle in the twilight,<br>
it is not too dark - there is still plenty of light.

And to be safe, I bring my flashing lamp,<br>
and ride carefully like a real champ.

But, oh boy, oh boy, is it nice,<br>
there are deer, bunnies, and little mice.

Oh, how smell of pine trees mix with smoke from the fireplace,<br>
it smells do good that I want to stop my race.

Sometimes, I do stop to look at the sun go down,<br>
but... I have to imagine the horizon as I am in middle of a town.

And hen the sun gets low enough all the clouds light up red,<br>
finally allowing the darkness to begin to spread.

That's usually when I turn around,<br>
but I love the frogs and crickets and the early night sound.

I wish I could capture it and keep it all,<br>
but all the pictures and videos I take look dull.

I think we should all take time to enjoy these simple treasures,<br>
as these are some of the life's most magnificent pleasures.
