    In a poem entitled "A Little Song" we have created a tiny minimalist drum heavy song,
    however, one of the best kinds of songs is one you can dance to.

    Let us modify our drum song, to be in harmony with Cutting Shapes, and Melbourne Shuffle,
    which is to say T-step, Shuffle, Triangles, Spins, Kicks and their many variations.

    Warning.


    Professional teachers, those who learned music creation from books, or learned from friends,
    will have different ideas in mind, they will frequently have better ideas that have been refined by other musicians.

    Listen, music is an abstract art, if you want to become an abstract artist,
    you are not allowed to learn from others, not from teachers not from friends.

    Your first song has to sound like *bleep*,
    and at the end of your career, that will become the song that will auction off for the highest number.

    If you fail to show a path of self education, if you just listen to the teachers,
    your works will have no blood, no heart, no love, no soul, no broken dreams, no broken hearts, they will have no value to the world.

    See, an empty canvas that sells for millions, isn't just a crazy art idea,
    it is the highest of heights that the author finally reached in his life long struggle for inner peace.

    It is that life long quest, and adventure, and struggle,
    that makes abstract art priceless.

    Mark my words,
    take great care of your works, because the earliest of your works are the most important, and their sound samples will eventually fuel your greatest hits.

    Start in the beginning,
    embrace minimalism.

    The biggest deal about a dance song, is a steady beat that the dancer can sync up to,
    and avoidance of empty space in a song where the dancer is forced to stop and wait for the beat to come back

    Dance songs are slightly more complicated,
    they live on a slightly higher abstraction level than Kicks, Claps, Hats and Melodies.

    This new abstraction is divided into four components,
    Drums, Bass, Chords, Melodies.

    ---

    Drums, are never just drums, always think of drum kits when someone mentions drums,
    a typical drum kit may include Bass Drum, Floor Tom, Snare Drum, Tom-Tom Hi-Hat, Crash Cymbal, Ride Cymbal, Splash Cymbal, and a China Cymbal.

    A drum kit is a noble and sophisticated instrument,
    in computer world we generate or record the sounds it makes, and simply stick those sounds in a song.

    As you can imagine, when people learn manual drum kits,
    they find countless drum-kit arrangements written for drums, some of them are as good as songs.

    And certainly,
    most songs would be no good without a drum kit.

    Do not be intimidated by the complexity of a drum kit,
    it simply makes sounds, low medium and high, and in computers you just schedule that an on a grid.

    Bass, is traditionally created with growling guitars,
    where drums are snappy, bass is winding and longer, but it is still a low frequency sound.

    All rules are meant to be broken, but think of bass as a low frequency or growling melody,
    but the notes shouldn't be too long lasting, like a violin or an organ.

    Bass gives you an opportunity to switch between a High Frequency or High Pitch Melody,
    and a low frequency growl, which can be very entertaining to the ear.

    ---

    Cords, are similar to piano melodies,
    where multiple keys are pressed at the same time to create rich sounds.

    They can sound stabby, and can be based on piano like synthesizers.
    Bass, Chords, and Melodies give the song a soul.

    Because bass is low frequency, chords medium frequency, and melodies are high pitched,
    you can have an arrangement where Bass, Chords and Melodies play at the same time.

    ---

    And finally, Melodies,
    it is just exactly what it sounds like, it is the stuff you whistle when the song is over.

    Melodies dominate a song, when everything is playing at once,
    the melody is what you will hear the most, it will overpower all the other stuff.

    ---

    It is good to work on a song within some constraint,
    creating a song meant for dancing is much easier, than creating a song.

    Furthermore, think of a song as a network of ideas,
    some ideas will be deliberate, such as making drums work really well with a bass guitar.

    Other ideas will happen by accident, songs become more and more complex the more you mess with them,
    you eventually lose control over the design, and this is not a bad thing.

    Let your song grow,
    go on a long nature trail, and soul search what may make that song better.

    Let us begin upgrading our song,
    the first and foremost is to make sure that we have a steady beat.

    Here is a simplified beginning to the "Little Song" with emphasis on beats,
    meaning at that at no point is the beat lost, you can tap your foot to it no problem.

    The song as it is right now, can be seen as the Drum Portion of our new song theory,
    the whole thing is just a drum kit, there is no bass, no chords, no melody here.

    Only an invitation,
    to add it in.

    ---

    Let us start in the beginning,
    and add bass.

    And since we already have drums going,
    let us connect the bass to the beat, let us make them good friends.

    Drums can easily overpower base,
    so we have to lower the volume of the drums, and bring up the the bass.

    Now keep in mind, that bass is the lowest frequency sound in our
    base, chords, and melody set, so keep it growling.

    Here is my base arrangement without the drums:

    and here it is with the drums in the background
    file:///home/meow/Downloads/just-bass-with-drums.wav

    At this point you can see that we have the dark part of the song,
    this is where our dancer slows down a little, this is the low go growl.

    Now let us move onto chords
