# Cat Pea Poetry
System Release 3

[Data Mirror](https://catpea.github.io/poetry/)

## Upgrade Overview

- Less resource use for GitHub, addition of files to YouTube (in progress).
- The reason for the existence of this system is src/text where original poetry is kept
- The primary product of this system is a json feed that is used by other programs to make web pages
- To get started execute ./menu.sh for a list of commands
- In addition to original poetry I store images that serve as covers and illustration
- Most of the poems come with an mp3 file, that is the read audio version
- Some of the earlier poems lack the mp3 and images
- Each audio version of the poem has a spectrogram image
- Each audio has a video version where audio plays along a scrolling spectrogram
- Audio book command creates an mp3 and mp4 version of **everything** (mp4 is a video of audio with spectrogram)
- There is a tiny build system that makes a docs mirror that is respectful of bandwidth use
