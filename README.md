## Upgrade Overview

- Less resource use for GitHub, addition of files to YouTube (in progress).
- The reason for the existence of this system is src/text where original poetry is kept
- The primary product of this system is a json feed that is used by other programs to make web pages
- To get started execute ./menu.sh for a list of commands
- In addition to original poetry I store images that serve as covers and illustration
- Most of the poems come with an mp3 file, that is the read audio version
- Some of the earlier poems lack the mp3 and images
- Each audio version of the poem has a spectrogram image
- Each audio has a video version where audio plays along a scrolling spectrogram
- Audio book command creates an mp3 and mp4 version of **everything** (mp4 is a video of audio with spectrogram)
- There is a tiny build system that makes a docs mirror that is respectful of bandwidth use

## Vocabulary

### Purrkies

Creative and inspirational ideas, that result from an extended cat-like nap, where it felt like you were purring throughout. The word seems to have originated in Westland, Michigan (US), and is primarily used amongst bodybuilders that frequently suffer the carbohydrate coma.

Yo bro, I woke up with so many purrkies on my mind, that I ran out of paper writing them down, and I had to resort to scribbling all over my beautiful body.
So, I was eating mashed potatoes right? and the purrkies hit me so hard, that I got my hands into the potatoes and started mushing them, man, and I created this beautiful laccolithic butte, that later turned out to be the perfect three dimensional map of the Devils Tower in Wyoming, yo!
